# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

### Context and Problem Statement

SAT and ACT is a mean to get into college. Hence, majority of the students either take SAT or ACT depending on their views and perceptions on how good they are in either one. Very rarely, students take both. In the past, SAT has been viewed as an aptitude test which is different from ACT which is academic based. The perception of SAT is that, aptitude is difficult to acquire through study. But this has changed in recent year as SAT is more balance similar to ACT and it even has composition as an option similar to ACT. Conversely, ACT has also change adopting SAT style in recent years.

To increase SAT participation rate means, students have to be convinced that SAT is not diffcult and in recent years and has moved towards a more balance approach similar to ACT rather than only aptitude based which has a misconception that it is difficult to learn (https://www.thoughtco.com/differences-between-sat-and-act-exams-788714).

The college board must be able to educate students and parents about the structure of SAT is more balance and achievable and sufficient budgets are given to the respective states to provide good high school education and test prep helping more students to succeed via the SAT route.

### EDA

After loading all the necessary data, data scrubbing took up bulk of the time to clean up the usual suspects such as identifying missng data, wrong data type, typos, etc.

The next step is to take a quick look at the data to identify relationships between variables and scatter plot is one of the best charts to for this purpose. As the data set is small, eye-balling the data may detect anomalies.

### Data Visualization

A picture worth a thousand words. Different charts provide greater insights than just eye-balling the data. For eg, histograms of total/ composite scores revealed a Bimodal distribution and scatter plots reveal a negative linear correlation between participation rates and overall scores. 

---

### Interpretation of Results:

From the graphs, scores for ACT and SAT is a bimodal distribution ie, there are twin peaks. For SAT, overall highest scores revolve between 1,000 and 1,100 and the second peak at 1,200. And it is consistent for both years. Similarly, ACT has the same behavior. One peak between 19.5 and 20.5 and another between 23 and 24.

Referring to the participation rates for both tests, it is negatively correlated. As explained by Dr Fred Zhang at PrepScholar, participation rate has a huge impact on scores. https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-and-act-scores-by-stated-adjusted-for-participation-rate 

Students has a tendancy to take the test that they have confident in. Thus if it is not mandatory for students to take a particular test, only 'good' students will take say, SAT. As a result, low participation rate foe that state but will high score. For states that make it mandatory to take cetain test, the participation rate is high but the average scores suffer. This explains the bimodal distribution for both tests - a small group of high score students (perhaps, well prepared) that form a peak and the rest of the average score students that form another peak.

### Business Recommendations:

Conclusions:
From the analysis, although there are many students fall in the average score bucket, there are measures college board can adopt to assist students to achieve their aspirations in completing SAT.

Recommendation:

Some are some best practices to increase SAT participation taken from a survey done by Hanover Reasearch such as dismantling barriers that have historically prevented students particularly minority students from realizing the opportunites for higher education.

Covering all or part of exam fees.
Offer free SAT Test Prep Options and waiver of Entrance Exam fees.
Increase budget for implementing or improving exsiting SAT education and test prep program eg, Massachusetts and Connecticut already have good education in place.
Implement online courses and grant students free access to course materials.
Educate and assure parents and potential SAT students that resources are available to support their SAT journey.
Bottom line: Make SAT affordable and accessible to all students.
