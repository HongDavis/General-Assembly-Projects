    "# Problem Statement & Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Obtain postings from 2 reddit threads ('The Truth is Here' (truth) and 'No Sleep' (nosleep)) using web scraping technique. The 2 groups are very different as in;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The truth thread is a collections of personal encounters with the unknown eg, non-fiction stories dealing with spirits, paranormal, strange happenings, and unexplained sightings while the nosleep thread is for authors to share their original horror stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The objective is to find out more about the attributes of the 2 threads and focus on the group that spend more time at Reddit and have a lot of followers ao that business has a higher conversion rate. Length of posts can be used as an indication of time spent online at Reddit. The longer the post the longer the time user spent at Reddit thus, higher chance of responding to advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictor is the 'selftext' and target is the 'subreddit'. Naive Bayes classifier will be used for the initial model to have a better feel of the data collected. Logistic Regression will be used with the aim to improve the initial model."

'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\", 'author_fullname': 't2_3jjbxvfb', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'How to Survive Camping: blood forcibly taken', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'flair-series', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fha5qz', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 1018, 'total_awards_received': 2, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Series', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 1018, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_2': 1}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584013105.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.

At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.

The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:\\n\\n\\n[“You are next.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw)\", 'author_fullname': 't2_20gz4yg3', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': '42 years ago we sent Voyager 1 into space to look for extraterrestrial life, today we found it.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fgwmy3', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 5491, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 5491, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 1}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583959837.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space.

The first one having arrived in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don&amp;#39;t understand, but what follows is the basics of what we&amp;#39;ve deciphered so far:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;December 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;March 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;September 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though the direct messages didn&amp;#39;t make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can&amp;#39;t even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn&amp;#39;t one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn&amp;#39;t calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw\"&gt;“You are next.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'id': 'gid_1', 'penny_donate': None, 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'icon_height': 512, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'description': \"Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.\", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'name': 'Silver', 'icon_format': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fgwmy3', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'RichardSaxon', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 221, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fgwmy3/42_years_ago_we_sent_voyager_1_into_space_to_look/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgwmy3/42_years_ago_we_sent_voyager_1_into_space_to_look/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583931037.0, 'num_crossposts': 5, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': \"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. \\n\\n\\nShe started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. \\n\\n\\nThen, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. \\n\\n\\nWas it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?\\n\\n\\nI didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\", 'author_fullname': 't2_2y34eooe', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'There’s something wrong with my cat', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh8ovn', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 202, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 202, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584006709.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cat is acting a bit… off.

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself.

Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. \\n\\n[“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. ](https://thehorrorstore.home.blog)', 'author_fullname': 't2_9ny50', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'I was legally dead for four minutes.

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street.

The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Haven’t seen it myself.

The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it.

It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Purgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh9iqd', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'iUsed2EatPeople', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 6, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh9iqd/while_working_as_a_game_tester_i_found_a/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh9iqd/while_working_as_a_game_tester_i_found_a/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583981432.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': '*In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.*\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)\\n\\nIt was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)', 'author_fullname': 't2_4leylht9', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Why You Should Always Honk If You\\'re Horny - A \"Rules of the Road\" Entry, Part 2 of 2', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'flair-series', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh858z', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 87, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Series', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 87, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584004517.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/\"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8beec82a-dcc1-11e8-a09f-0e09eae1a1c0', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh858z', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'throwawayaracehorse', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 5, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh858z/why_you_should_always_honk_if_youre_horny_a_rules/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh858z/why_you_should_always_honk_if_youre_horny_a_rules/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583975717.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)', 'author_fullname': 't2_hw0t0', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'How to Gain Six Inches in Less Than 24 Hours', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fguqho', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 1420, 'total_awards_received': 2, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 1420, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_2': 1}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583949623.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lughnasadh.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I &lt;em&gt;dying?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Short, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The poor idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t know, Mike,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. &lt;em&gt;Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I was losing a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor handsome idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, is … is this blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe.

Please help-\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, kid!\"\\n\\nMr. Smith, Mr. McWright\\'s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it\\'s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could\\'ve happened to me, if it wasn\\'t for Mr. Smith.\\n\\nIt was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn\\'t for me, he would\\'ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn\\'t the principal speaking.\\n\\nWe heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?\\n\\nI hadn\\'t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I\\'d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn\\'t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?\\n\\nIt was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m next.\"\\n\\nI opened the door, and saw that there wasn\\'t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I\\'m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they\\'re everywhere.\\n\\nI saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. \\n\\n\"OP! Where are your classmates? Aren\\'t they supposed to be here? Didn\\'t the principal all tell you?\"\\n\\nThe principal? Wasn\\'t the principal already dead?\\n\\n\"Hey Finn, where\\'s your homeroom adviser?\"\\n\\n\"Dead, we\\'d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn\\'t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one\\'s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.\"\\n\\n\"I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?\"\\n\\nI presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.\\n\\nWe brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.\\n\\nWe were outsmarted, Finn\\'s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.\\n\\nAnd then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn\\'t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn\\'t move, couldn\\'t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it\\'s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I\\'ve ever felt. I\\'m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.\\n\\nI could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don\\'t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane?

Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest.

I haven&amp;#39;t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-awful thing to happen-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was so young, it didn&amp;#39;t look like anything was wrong-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-I hope the family will be okay-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-No, I don&amp;#39;t know why she did it-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the boy who found her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aye, he&amp;#39;s been sitting there since they came back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don&amp;#39;t know them, but they know me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did they know her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I just did that. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don&amp;#39;t know why he isn&amp;#39;t with mom right now. I&amp;#39;m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re here in the first place. I don&amp;#39;t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven&amp;#39;t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dad&amp;#39;s hunched over the sink. He&amp;#39;s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There&amp;#39;s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first room I see is open. There&amp;#39;re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It&amp;#39;s wood. Inside is something I couldn&amp;#39;t get down from the shower in time. Granny&amp;#39;s in there, and she&amp;#39;s leading the rosary. The people she&amp;#39;s praying with have never met my family. They&amp;#39;re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven&amp;#39;t opened it yet. They&amp;#39;re all staying in granny&amp;#39;s hotel. I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve ever been to this village before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the people turns to me, frowning. He&amp;#39;s a black man. There&amp;#39;s no one of his skin color in this village, but there&amp;#39;s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She&amp;#39;d want to be buried over there, not here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she&amp;#39;s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She&amp;#39;s dressed in a beautiful white dress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boy,&amp;quot; the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glance at her. She&amp;#39;s still praying. Her eyes haven&amp;#39;t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn&amp;#39;t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. &amp;quot;Caoimhe,&amp;quot; he said, turning to my grandmother, &amp;quot;Caoimhe, your grandson is here.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can&amp;#39;t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to lose someone you&amp;#39;ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...&amp;quot; She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I&amp;#39;m done, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying anymore. I&amp;#39;m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don&amp;#39;t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don&amp;#39;t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They&amp;#39;re also crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny&amp;#39;s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t say anything. It&amp;#39;s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny&amp;#39;s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he&amp;#39;s the man who tried to make me support my granny.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m naked and look at the bed. No one&amp;#39;s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don&amp;#39;t know. They might as well be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get dressed until I&amp;#39;ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven&amp;#39;t flushed since last night, and don&amp;#39;t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn&amp;#39;t I save them?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I&amp;#39;m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It&amp;#39;s the man from Jenny&amp;#39;s funeral. He&amp;#39;s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There&amp;#39;s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They&amp;#39;ve changed. Where&amp;#39;s granda? I don&amp;#39;t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord&amp;#39;s Chosen,&amp;quot; she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, &amp;quot;he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say aloud then walk up to the bar. &amp;quot;Hey, can you turn that up?&amp;quot; I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my family on there.&amp;quot; His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he&amp;#39;d visited.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s impossible. There&amp;#39;s no way that... no way that this man... &amp;quot;Who is that?&amp;quot; I ask when the black man is on the screen again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calls himself the Prophet,&amp;quot; the barman says, &amp;quot;cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prophet,&amp;quot; I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That. Utter. Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place.

And trust me, it\\'s not as amazing as it sounds.\\n\\nEvery now and then I\\'ll be doing whatever when I either suddenly feel like I\\'m not alone or for a brief moment I\\'ll see something out of the corner of my eye. Sometimes their shaped like humans, sometimes various animals, but every once in awhile their shaped like creatures I\\'ve never seen before, creatures that are absolutely horrifying to see for even a second.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m crazy. But I have proof, or at least what I think is proof.\\n\\nI had a very...unusual...imaginary friend as a child.\\nHe was tall, so tall that he had to hunch down or he\\'d hit the roof of the trailer I lived in. My mother\\'s boyfriend was 6\\'2 and only had to lightly duck. My friend wore a long black cloak and always had the hood up. He didn\\'t have a face, at least one I couldn\\'t see. And his hands...his hands were just bones, not even scrapes of flesh on them.\\n\\nAnd yet even as a small child I wasn\\'t scared of him.i don\\'t know how I became friends with him, he just kinda showed up. He would play tea party with me and make my stuffed animals drink from their tealess tea cups. He would never speak but somehow I always knew what he wanted me too do.\\n\\nHe never made me do anything bad. He\\'d tell me to go to my room whenever my mom and her boyfriend argued,  he helped me learn to reas and write basic words, and would remind me not to go in the streets or near strangers when my mom took me out. He was nice and made me laugh and smile.\\n\\nThen came the day he stopped playing with me.\\n\\nIt was a normal day, I was playing outside and he was watching over me. I suddenly felt the ball yanked out of my hands and watched as it was thrown into the street. I looked and...something... was standing there, watching me with a sinister smile. My friend quickly stood in front of me and the creature just laughed.\\n\\nI, being a dumb kid, decided to go grab my ball. And right at that moment some dumb kid decided to speed around the corner. I barely remember what happened next. I was on the ground and my friend stood between me and the car. A large dent was made where my friend was standing.\\n\\nI woke up in the hospital later, my mom crying next to me. Apparently the kid was drunk, but not drunk enough to not remember. He apparenly told the police some guy in a long cloak managed to somehow stop the car before it hit me.\\n\\nThat night before I fell asleep my friend visited me. And for the first and only time, he spoke.\\n\\n\"It\\'s too dangerous for me to be near you.\" He croaked out. \"They can find you easier if I\\'m near you.\" \"But don\\'t worry, I\\'ll still protect you for as long as I can.\" And with that, he disappeared.\\n\\nIt\\'s been ten years since then. I\\'m eighteen now and all the strange things I talked about earlier have happened through the years.\\n\\nEven though they always terrify the hell out me, nothing ever happens.

And trust me, it&amp;#39;s not as amazing as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every now and then I&amp;#39;ll be doing whatever when I either suddenly feel like I&amp;#39;m not alone or for a brief moment I&amp;#39;ll see something out of the corner of my eye. Sometimes their shaped like humans, sometimes various animals, but every once in awhile their shaped like creatures I&amp;#39;ve never seen before, creatures that are absolutely horrifying to see for even a second.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m crazy. But I have proof, or at least what I think is proof.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had a very...unusual...imaginary friend as a child.\\nHe was tall, so tall that he had to hunch down or he&amp;#39;d hit the roof of the trailer I lived in. My mother&amp;#39;s boyfriend was 6&amp;#39;2 and only had to lightly duck. My friend wore a long black cloak and always had the hood up. He didn&amp;#39;t have a face, at least one I couldn&amp;#39;t see. And his hands...his hands were just bones, not even scrapes of flesh on them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet even as a small child I wasn&amp;#39;t scared of him.i don&amp;#39;t know how I became friends with him, he just kinda showed up. He would play tea party with me and make my stuffed animals drink from their tealess tea cups. He would never speak but somehow I always knew what he wanted me too do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He never made me do anything bad. He&amp;#39;d tell me to go to my room whenever my mom and her boyfriend argued,  he helped me learn to reas and write basic words, and would remind me not to go in the streets or near strangers when my mom took me out. He was nice and made me laugh and smile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the day he stopped playing with me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a normal day, I was playing outside and he was watching over me. I suddenly felt the ball yanked out of my hands and watched as it was thrown into the street. I looked and...something... was standing there, watching me with a sinister smile. My friend quickly stood in front of me and the creature just laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I, being a dumb kid, decided to go grab my ball. And right at that moment some dumb kid decided to speed around the corner. I barely remember what happened next. I was on the ground and my friend stood between me and the car. A large dent was made where my friend was standing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the hospital later, my mom crying next to me. Apparently the kid was drunk, but not drunk enough to not remember. He apparenly told the police some guy in a long cloak managed to somehow stop the car before it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night before I fell asleep my friend visited me. And for the first and only time, he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s too dangerous for me to be near you.&amp;quot; He croaked out. &amp;quot;They can find you easier if I&amp;#39;m near you.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;But don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;ll still protect you for as long as I can.&amp;quot; And with that, he disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been ten years since then. I&amp;#39;m eighteen now and all the strange things I talked about earlier have happened through the years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they always terrify the hell out me, nothing ever happens. They don&amp;#39;t touch me and always disappear after a moment. And my friend is still around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m ever scared or sad he&amp;#39;ll appear.

The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing.

All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.\\n\\nMr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*\\n\\nA little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.\\n\\nThe Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.\\n\\nIn 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…\\n\\nI was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. \\n\\nCome 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”\\n\\n“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?\\n\\n“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”\\n\\nI was stunned into silence.\\n\\n“If you\\'re a journalist, you\\'re a bad one, but I don\\'t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO\\'s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. \\n\\nA dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will.

Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was stunned into silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you&amp;#39;re a journalist, you&amp;#39;re a bad one, but I don&amp;#39;t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO&amp;#39;s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fgxiok', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'harrydownto', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 12, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fgxiok/one_of_my_alzheimers_patients_said_something_that/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgxiok/one_of_my_alzheimers_patients_said_something_that/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583934902.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': '\\nSo, we have all heard scary stories.

My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID.

Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood.

My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn&amp;#39;t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he&amp;#39;s okay, to which he replied: &amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...&amp;quot;. Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with &amp;quot;What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?&amp;quot; He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- What? What are you talking abou-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-  You need to return. It is time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together.

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. \\n\\nJournal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it.

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Journal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later.

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)', 'author_fullname': 't2_11d38ddb', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'It Pulls You Down.

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?  What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you think happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.

Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.

The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.

I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.

I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing.

It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.\\n\\nA voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Homo homini lupus.* Man is a wolf to man.', 'author_fullname': 't2_5qn3elvd', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': \"I uncovered a three hundred years old family secret.

It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Grand succès !”&lt;/em&gt; He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fgyrs6', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Habaguanex', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 14, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fgyrs6/i_uncovered_a_three_hundred_years_old_family/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgyrs6/i_uncovered_a_three_hundred_years_old_family/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583940002.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'I remember when i was around 5, I was walking through a shopping centre with my Mum, when i saw this girl, she was a teen.

They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_5wplc085', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'The Extra Rooms', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh7ijt', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 25, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 25, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584001820.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people&amp;#39;s houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Me and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa&amp;#39;s basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It&amp;#39;s me! I can&amp;#39;t believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn&amp;#39;t think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39; took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39;, again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It&amp;#39;s really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I&amp;#39;m not going down there. Can&amp;#39;t you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn&amp;#39;t move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I&amp;#39;m going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat.

I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. \\n\\nMy father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. \\n\\nWe should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. \\n\\nI remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. \\n\\nSuddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. \\n\\nTreading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. \\n\\nSome of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures.

I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I waited an hour. Then two. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Becoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Treading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My hunting party didn’t see it that way though.

Not as a murderer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So instead I made those men a promise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food.

Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view.

That was when I knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was the monster that had taken her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;——————————————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone!

Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.\\n\\n11:45 PM\\n\\nI’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--**\\n\\n11:52 PM\\n\\nI’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.\\n\\n11:54 PM\\n\\nIncident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n11:59 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but\\n\\n3/8/2020 12:01 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.\\n\\n12:09 AM\\n\\nPrevious  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**\\n\\n12:29 AM\\n\\nIn  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.\\n\\n12:38 AM\\n\\nIncident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.\\n\\n12:42 AM\\n\\nCorridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?\\n\\n12:54 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.\\n\\n1:01 AM\\n\\nThe  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.\\n\\n1:08 AM\\n\\nThe screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.\\n\\n1:12 AM\\n\\nI’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.\\n\\n1:15 AM\\n\\nThe  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.\\n\\n1:18 AM\\n\\nNo  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—**\\n\\n1:24 PM\\n\\nIt  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.\\n\\n1:27 AM\\n\\nThe black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—**\\n\\nThe  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…\\n\\nHe’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.

My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.\\n\\nPain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.\\n\\nMaddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.\\n\\nChanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.\\n\\nWould  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.

I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:09 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:38 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:54 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:08 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:12 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:18 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:27 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why?  Just end this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Bottom part of page crumpled and torn.

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. \\n\\nDouglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. \\n\\nA loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.', 'author_fullname': 't2_2l6zvu23', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'I’m a...different...kind of police officer.

As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8beec82a-dcc1-11e8-a09f-0e09eae1a1c0', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh3ek0', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': '-big-bad-wolf', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 9, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh3ek0/im_adifferentkind_of_police_officer_sometimes_you/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh3ek0/im_adifferentkind_of_police_officer_sometimes_you/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840907, 'created_utc': 1583957181.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}], 'after': 't3_fh3ek0', 'before': None}}"

       "    'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\",\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/\"&gt;how badly things went last week&lt;/a&gt;.  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/\"&gt;Read the full list of rules.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/\"&gt;Visit the campground&amp;#39;s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space. The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:\\n\\n\\n[“You are next.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw)\",\n",

       "    'selftext': \"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. \\n\\n\\nShe started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. \\n\\n\\nThen, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. \\n\\n\\nWas it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?\\n\\n\\nI didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\",\n",

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. \\n\\n[“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. ](https://thehorrorstore.home.blog)',\n",

       "    'selftext': ' \\n\\nI studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Purgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club.

       "    'selftext': '*In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.*\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)\\n\\nIt was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/\"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)',\n",

Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I &lt;em&gt;dying?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Short, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The poor idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t know, Mike,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. &lt;em&gt;Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I was losing a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor handsome idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, is … is this blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy\"&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Please help-\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, kid!\"\\n\\nMr. Smith, Mr. McWright\\'s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it\\'s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could\\'ve happened to me, if it wasn\\'t for Mr. Smith.\\n\\nIt was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn\\'t for me, he would\\'ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn\\'t the principal speaking.\\n\\nWe heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?\\n\\nI hadn\\'t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I\\'d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn\\'t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?\\n\\nIt was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m next.\"\\n\\nI opened the door, and saw that there wasn\\'t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I\\'m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they\\'re everywhere.\\n\\nI saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. \\n\\n\"OP! Where are your classmates? Aren\\'t they supposed to be here? Didn\\'t the principal all tell you?\"\\n\\nThe principal? Wasn\\'t the principal already dead?\\n\\n\"Hey Finn, where\\'s your homeroom adviser?\"\\n\\n\"Dead, we\\'d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn\\'t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one\\'s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.\"\\n\\n\"I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?\"\\n\\nI presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.\\n\\nWe brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.\\n\\nWe were outsmarted, Finn\\'s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.\\n\\nAnd then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn\\'t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn\\'t move, couldn\\'t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it\\'s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I\\'ve ever felt. I\\'m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.\\n\\nI could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don\\'t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.\\n\\nAnd it burst itself out.\\n\\nI\\'m one of them now.\\n\\nI must do what I have to do.\\n\\nI must.',\n",

I haven\\'t tried it yet.\\n\\nThe casket is upstairs. I haven\\'t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I\\'m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.\\n\\n\"-awful thing to happen-\"\\n\\n\"She was so young, it didn\\'t look like anything was wrong-\"\\n\\n\"-I hope the family will be okay-\"\\n\\n\"-No, I don\\'t know why she did it-\"\\n\\n\"Is that the boy who found her?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, he\\'s been sitting there since they came back.\"\\n\\n\"Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.\\n\\n\"No,\" the bartender said softly, \"but... look, son, I think I know what\\'s going through your head.\"\\n\\nI looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t go down that road. There\\'s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don\\'t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It\\'ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n\"It already has,\" I say softly, \"and it\\'s gotten my family now.\" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I\\'m not going to work. I\\'ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I\\'ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.\\n\\nI know where the Prophet will be. He\\'ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn\\'t.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for a homecoming.',\n",

I don&amp;#39;t know why I picked it up. I haven&amp;#39;t tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The casket is upstairs. I haven&amp;#39;t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-awful thing to happen-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was so young, it didn&amp;#39;t look like anything was wrong-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-I hope the family will be okay-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-No, I don&amp;#39;t know why she did it-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the boy who found her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aye, he&amp;#39;s been sitting there since they came back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don&amp;#39;t know them, but they know me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did they know her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I just did that. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don&amp;#39;t know why he isn&amp;#39;t with mom right now. I&amp;#39;m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re here in the first place. I don&amp;#39;t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven&amp;#39;t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dad&amp;#39;s hunched over the sink. He&amp;#39;s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There&amp;#39;s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first room I see is open. There&amp;#39;re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It&amp;#39;s wood. Inside is something I couldn&amp;#39;t get down from the shower in time. Granny&amp;#39;s in there, and she&amp;#39;s leading the rosary. The people she&amp;#39;s praying with have never met my family. They&amp;#39;re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven&amp;#39;t opened it yet. They&amp;#39;re all staying in granny&amp;#39;s hotel. I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve ever been to this village before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the people turns to me, frowning. He&amp;#39;s a black man. There&amp;#39;s no one of his skin color in this village, but there&amp;#39;s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She&amp;#39;d want to be buried over there, not here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she&amp;#39;s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She&amp;#39;s dressed in a beautiful white dress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boy,&amp;quot; the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glance at her. She&amp;#39;s still praying. Her eyes haven&amp;#39;t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn&amp;#39;t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. &amp;quot;Caoimhe,&amp;quot; he said, turning to my grandmother, &amp;quot;Caoimhe, your grandson is here.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can&amp;#39;t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to lose someone you&amp;#39;ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...&amp;quot; She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I&amp;#39;m done, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying anymore. I&amp;#39;m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don&amp;#39;t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don&amp;#39;t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They&amp;#39;re also crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny&amp;#39;s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending.

I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn&amp;#39;t I save them?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I&amp;#39;m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass.

The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he&amp;#39;d visited.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be.

It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That. Utter. Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest.

Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place.

       "    'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-\"*\\n\\nThere were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.\\n\\nMr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*\\n\\nA little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.\\n\\nThe Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.\\n\\nIn 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…\\n\\nI was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. \\n\\nCome 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”\\n\\n“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?\\n\\n“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”\\n\\nI was stunned into silence.\\n\\n“If you\\'re a journalist, you\\'re a bad one, but I don\\'t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO\\'s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. \\n\\nA dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;can you hear the screams.&lt;/em&gt;” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home&lt;/em&gt;?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “&lt;em&gt;I can’t see. Please, can I go home?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I can’t see…&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: &lt;em&gt;Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Come 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death.

       "    'selftext': 'My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn\\'t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nA familiar voice spoke:\\n\\n\\\\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I\\'ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...\\n\\nHung up.\\n\\nI thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:\\n\\n\"Now the price is paid.\"',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn&amp;#39;t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he&amp;#39;s okay, to which he replied: &amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...&amp;quot;. Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with &amp;quot;What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?&amp;quot; He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- What? What are you talking abou-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-  You need to return. It is time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he &amp;quot;finished his task&amp;quot; and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. &amp;quot; I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.&amp;quot; then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent&amp;#39;s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called &amp;quot;the enlightenment&amp;quot; to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. &amp;quot;You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it&amp;#39;s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.&amp;quot; he said before disappering into the void...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn&amp;#39;t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I&amp;#39;d say they normally would ask more questions. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: &amp;quot; Read the book and you will know everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the quickest and biggest &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot; of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan&amp;#39;s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice spoke:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I&amp;#39;ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot;? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: &amp;quot;Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute&amp;quot;. I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. &amp;quot;Emma, are you in there?&amp;quot; No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood.

The light displayed a gruesome trail of blood, leading to a deformed maroon shape, on the street-side.\\n\\nThe man coughed, almost a gag; as he averted his eyes from the scene. He collected himself, and kissed his child on the head, holding back tears. Turning back towards the window, the man was overwhelmed with terror.\\n\\nThe woman, now standing, was alone in the street. The small lamp flickering overhead, revealed the demonic gaze that was directly fixed at him. Her body contorted, and was dripping blood from exposed bone.\\n\\n\"Zoe, please baby, it\\'s cold out here, I need my jaaackett.\" the entity seemed to say, playfully; starting towards the trailer.\\n\\nThe man quickly drew the curtain, pausing for a moment to look at his daughter, before standing. \\n\\n\"Daddy wha- what are you doing?\" The girl said confused. \\n\\nThe man wiped the fear off his brow, and leaned in to kiss his daughter lovingly on the forehead. He looked calm, the daughter noticed; as he grabbed the garment from the floor.\\n\\nThe man walked towards the door, stopped and looked back at his daughter. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry Zoe, daddy\\'s gonna go play with Mommy in the snow.

       "    'selftext': 'As I listened to the radio driving in my beat up car, I couldn’t help but think about seeing my mom,dad, and sister for the first time since leaving for university. This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time. I pulled into the parking garage and found a spot not too clogged with the amount of cars that would surprise anyone considering the time. With a turn of my key in the ignition, my car shut down with a tired gasp. \\nI approached the doors of the airport surprised at the amount of inactivity in the drop-off zone. I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. \\n\\nI took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. \\n\\nI left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.\\nI went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  \\n\\nAs I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. \\n“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. \\n\\nThe clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall. I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.\\n\\nI exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before. I continued in my day contemplating what just happened until I sat down in the Boeing 737. The man I was sitting next to had a musky smelling cologne,white wrinkly fingers and some black dress shoes.',\n",

I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before. I continued in my day contemplating what just happened until I sat down in the Boeing 737. The man I was sitting next to had a musky smelling cologne,white wrinkly fingers and some black dress shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'My name is project #124 part two\\n\\n\\n\\nPapa asked me a strange question. I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. \\n\\nJournal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!',\n",

Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)',\n",

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?  What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you think happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You.&lt;/em&gt;”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/9ndww5\"&gt;And now the man was killing him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Sometimes the truth lies just before our eyes, but we refuse to see it. For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. \\n\\nScrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.\\n\\nThe last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.\\n\\nWhat I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.\\n\\nA voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Homo homini lupus.* Man is a wolf to man.',\n",

For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old priest about this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers.

It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church.

He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush.

No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing.

They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Grand succès !”&lt;/em&gt; He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people's houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\",\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people&amp;#39;s houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Me and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa&amp;#39;s basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It&amp;#39;s me! I can&amp;#39;t believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn&amp;#39;t think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39; took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction.

       "    'selftext': 'I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.\\n\\nI’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.\\n\\nShe hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence. Her eyes meet mine and I see my chance. I opened my arms wide and she fell into them, allowing me to wrap her up in a tight embrace.\\n\\nI immediately felt the warm of her body pressed against mine. I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. \\n\\nI continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. \\n\\nOh God, but I love hugs.',\n",

I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh God, but I love hugs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': '\\n\\n________\\n\\nThe world died in 1908. \\n\\nThat’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. \\n\\nMy father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. \\n\\nWe should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. \\n\\nI remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. \\n\\nSuddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. \\n\\nTreading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. \\n\\nSome of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. \\n\\nThanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. \\n\\nWhen we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. \\n\\nMy hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. \\n\\nSome of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. \\n\\nMy father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. \\n\\nSo instead I made those men a promise. \\n\\n“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food. The monsters were grateful and after the meat was torn from the scientist’s body, they tossed the rest into a large hole and gestured for me to follow into the mountain. \\n\\nIn such a remote wilderness, over the years we have found it easy to stay hidden. I watched as scientists came and left trying to study the after effects of the crater. I realized also I had been given some of these as a result of simply being close to my father and the others. They have become less and less human over the years, unable to die and tormented by their ghastly appearance and their mental deterioration. \\n\\nI have tried to help them as best as I can, moving them to stay hidden and hunting food here in the Siberian waste. But we will never again be a part of the world that we once knew. I died that day when the sky split. I’ve lived as a ghost ever since. \\n\\nI tell all of this knowing now that I likely will be losing touch of my own sensibilities soon, the effects of the meteorite finally taking its full toll on me. And then living as a monster, likely for the rest of eternity. \\n\\nOnce my own mind is gone, nothing will prevents these creatures from venturing beyond isolation. From finding life that can be used to hunt and to kill and to infect others. \\n\\nAll I can say is that we are sorry, we cannot control this curse that has been with us all these years. If you do encounter us, my only advice would be to run. \\n\\n[Run and hide](https://youtu.be/mWVPG8czpI4)\\n\\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)',\n",

That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. \\n\\nOctober nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.\\n\\nAfter class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”\\n\\n“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive.

It’s way too dangerous.” I said.\\n\\nLeo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” \\n\\nI was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. \\n\\n“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.\\n\\n“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. \\n\\nI pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand.

I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

       "    'selftext': ' **--Case #40157J –Paranormal Research Division--**\\n\\n**Confiscated from Cairo police department on 3/8/2020**\\n\\n**Journal entries from Canadian-American researcher Steven K. Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.

Simms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case status: OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.

In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.

Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. \\n\\nDouglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. \\n\\nA loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/\"&gt;how badly things went last week&lt;/a&gt;.  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/\"&gt;Read the full list of rules.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/\"&gt;Visit the campground&amp;#39;s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space. The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:\\n\\n\\n[“You are next.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw)\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. \\n\\n\\nShe started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. \\n\\n\\nThen, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. \\n\\n\\nWas it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?\\n\\n\\nI didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\",\n",

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. \\n\\n[“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. ](https://thehorrorstore.home.blog)',\n",

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street.

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nI studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Purgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all.

       "   'selftext': '*In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.*\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)\\n\\nIt was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/\"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)',\n",

Is that weird for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t know, Mike,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. &lt;em&gt;Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I was losing a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor handsome idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, is … is this blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy\"&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I don\\'t know what uttered me to spit out those few words, I didn\\'t want to know what they meant. Am I gonna be next? What\\'s gonna happen to me? Who is this? This isn\\'t Mr. McWright anymore. I slowly moved my hand, and held on to what I could make out, was its hand. I fought for control over my own body, I don\\'t even know if it\\'s me that\\'s moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, kid!\"\\n\\nMr. Smith, Mr. McWright\\'s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it\\'s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could\\'ve happened to me, if it wasn\\'t for Mr. Smith.\\n\\nIt was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn\\'t for me, he would\\'ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn\\'t the principal speaking.\\n\\nWe heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?\\n\\nI hadn\\'t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I\\'d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn\\'t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?\\n\\nIt was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m next.\"\\n\\nI opened the door, and saw that there wasn\\'t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I\\'m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they\\'re everywhere.\\n\\nI saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. \\n\\n\"OP! Where are your classmates? Aren\\'t they supposed to be here? Didn\\'t the principal all tell you?\"\\n\\nThe principal? Wasn\\'t the principal already dead?\\n\\n\"Hey Finn, where\\'s your homeroom adviser?\"\\n\\n\"Dead, we\\'d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn\\'t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one\\'s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.\"\\n\\n\"I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?\"\\n\\nI presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.\\n\\nWe brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.\\n\\nWe were outsmarted, Finn\\'s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.\\n\\nAnd then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn\\'t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn\\'t move, couldn\\'t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it\\'s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I\\'ve ever felt. I\\'m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.\\n\\nI could feel myself, becoming one of them.

Am I gonna be next? What&amp;#39;s gonna happen to me? Who is this? This isn&amp;#39;t Mr. McWright anymore. I slowly moved my hand, and held on to what I could make out, was its hand. I fought for control over my own body, I don&amp;#39;t even know if it&amp;#39;s me that&amp;#39;s moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it, kid!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith, Mr. McWright&amp;#39;s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it&amp;#39;s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could&amp;#39;ve happened to me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for Mr. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for me, he would&amp;#39;ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn&amp;#39;t the principal speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I&amp;#39;d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn&amp;#39;t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m next.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door, and saw that there wasn&amp;#39;t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I&amp;#39;m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they&amp;#39;re everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OP! Where are your classmates? Aren&amp;#39;t they supposed to be here? Didn&amp;#39;t the principal all tell you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The principal? Wasn&amp;#39;t the principal already dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Finn, where&amp;#39;s your homeroom adviser?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dead, we&amp;#39;d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one&amp;#39;s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were outsmarted, Finn&amp;#39;s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn&amp;#39;t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn&amp;#39;t move, couldn&amp;#39;t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it&amp;#39;s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I&amp;#39;ve ever felt. I&amp;#39;m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don&amp;#39;t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it burst itself out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of them now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I must do what I have to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I must.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I haven\\'t tried it yet.\\n\\nThe casket is upstairs. I haven\\'t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I\\'m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.\\n\\n\"-awful thing to happen-\"\\n\\n\"She was so young, it didn\\'t look like anything was wrong-\"\\n\\n\"-I hope the family will be okay-\"\\n\\n\"-No, I don\\'t know why she did it-\"\\n\\n\"Is that the boy who found her?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, he\\'s been sitting there since they came back.\"\\n\\n\"Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.\\n\\n\"No,\" the bartender said softly, \"but... look, son, I think I know what\\'s going through your head.\"\\n\\nI looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t go down that road. There\\'s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don\\'t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It\\'ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n\"It already has,\" I say softly, \"and it\\'s gotten my family now.\" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I\\'m not going to work.

I don&amp;#39;t know why I picked it up. I haven&amp;#39;t tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The casket is upstairs. I haven&amp;#39;t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-awful thing to happen-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was so young, it didn&amp;#39;t look like anything was wrong-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-I hope the family will be okay-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-No, I don&amp;#39;t know why she did it-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the boy who found her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aye, he&amp;#39;s been sitting there since they came back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don&amp;#39;t know them, but they know me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did they know her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I just did that. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don&amp;#39;t know why he isn&amp;#39;t with mom right now. I&amp;#39;m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re here in the first place. I don&amp;#39;t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven&amp;#39;t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dad&amp;#39;s hunched over the sink. He&amp;#39;s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There&amp;#39;s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first room I see is open. There&amp;#39;re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It&amp;#39;s wood. Inside is something I couldn&amp;#39;t get down from the shower in time. Granny&amp;#39;s in there, and she&amp;#39;s leading the rosary. The people she&amp;#39;s praying with have never met my family. They&amp;#39;re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven&amp;#39;t opened it yet. They&amp;#39;re all staying in granny&amp;#39;s hotel. I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve ever been to this village before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the people turns to me, frowning. He&amp;#39;s a black man. There&amp;#39;s no one of his skin color in this village, but there&amp;#39;s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She&amp;#39;d want to be buried over there, not here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she&amp;#39;s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She&amp;#39;s dressed in a beautiful white dress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boy,&amp;quot; the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glance at her. She&amp;#39;s still praying. Her eyes haven&amp;#39;t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn&amp;#39;t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. &amp;quot;Caoimhe,&amp;quot; he said, turning to my grandmother, &amp;quot;Caoimhe, your grandson is here.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can&amp;#39;t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to lose someone you&amp;#39;ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...&amp;quot; She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I&amp;#39;m done, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying anymore. I&amp;#39;m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don&amp;#39;t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don&amp;#39;t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They&amp;#39;re also crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny&amp;#39;s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t say anything. It&amp;#39;s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny&amp;#39;s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he&amp;#39;s the man who tried to make me support my granny.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m naked and look at the bed. No one&amp;#39;s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don&amp;#39;t know. They might as well be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get dressed until I&amp;#39;ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven&amp;#39;t flushed since last night, and don&amp;#39;t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn&amp;#39;t I save them?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I&amp;#39;m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It&amp;#39;s the man from Jenny&amp;#39;s funeral. He&amp;#39;s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There&amp;#39;s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They&amp;#39;ve changed. Where&amp;#39;s granda? I don&amp;#39;t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord&amp;#39;s Chosen,&amp;quot; she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, &amp;quot;he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say aloud then walk up to the bar. &amp;quot;Hey, can you turn that up?&amp;quot; I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my family on there.&amp;quot; His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he&amp;#39;d visited.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s impossible. There&amp;#39;s no way that... no way that this man... &amp;quot;Who is that?&amp;quot; I ask when the black man is on the screen again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calls himself the Prophet,&amp;quot; the barman says, &amp;quot;cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prophet,&amp;quot; I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That. Utter. Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

And his hands...his hands were just bones, not even scrapes of flesh on them.\\n\\nAnd yet even as a small child I wasn\\'t scared of him.i don\\'t know how I became friends with him, he just kinda showed up. He would play tea party with me and make my stuffed animals drink from their tealess tea cups. He would never speak but somehow I always knew what he wanted me too do.\\n\\nHe never made me do anything bad. He\\'d tell me to go to my room whenever my mom and her boyfriend argued,  he helped me learn to reas and write basic words, and would remind me not to go in the streets or near strangers when my mom took me out. He was nice and made me laugh and smile.\\n\\nThen came the day he stopped playing with me.\\n\\nIt was a normal day, I was playing outside and he was watching over me. I suddenly felt the ball yanked out of my hands and watched as it was thrown into the street. I looked and...something... was standing there, watching me with a sinister smile. My friend quickly stood in front of me and the creature just laughed.\\n\\nI, being a dumb kid, decided to go grab my ball. And right at that moment some dumb kid decided to speed around the corner. I barely remember what happened next. I was on the ground and my friend stood between me and the car. A large dent was made where my friend was standing.\\n\\nI woke up in the hospital later, my mom crying next to me. Apparently the kid was drunk, but not drunk enough to not remember.

       "   'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-\"*\\n\\nThere were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.\\n\\nMr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*\\n\\nA little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.\\n\\nThe Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.\\n\\nIn 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…\\n\\nI was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. \\n\\nCome 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”\\n\\n“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?\\n\\n“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”\\n\\nI was stunned into silence.\\n\\n“If you\\'re a journalist, you\\'re a bad one, but I don\\'t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO\\'s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. \\n\\nA dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;can you hear the screams.&lt;/em&gt;” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home&lt;/em&gt;?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “&lt;em&gt;I can’t see. Please, can I go home?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I can’t see…&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: &lt;em&gt;Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Come 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was stunned into silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you&amp;#39;re a journalist, you&amp;#39;re a bad one, but I don&amp;#39;t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO&amp;#39;s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

What is your neighbour doing, what is your friend thinking, what is going on in the forest in the backyard.\\n\\nOf course, some of us think we know what’s happening, but we never know the full story, or the reasons that has led something to happen the way it did. The only thing we can be certain of, is the fact that we never actually know everything.\\n\\nOne day, Maya, was coming home from school, just like every other day. But this time, the kind person living with the cute dog, didn’t walk past her. The bell didn’t ring two times, the red car wasn’t parked in the same spot as always, her mom didn’t pick her up on her way.\\n\\nWell, all of these things have reasonable explanations, Maya thought. The person with the dog was probably just home sick, the bell was getting fixed, the red car was being borrowed to a friend, and her mom just had some extra work to do before coming home.\\n\\nOr so, she thought. Completely oblivious.\\n\\nBut actually, the kind person with the dog had had enough of the barking and hanged the dog, the bell had been destroyed by vandals, the red car had crashed, killing the family inside. Her mom was coming home, but depressed and crying, not wanting to go on living anymore. \\n\\nMaya did her homework, ate, and eventually went to bed. She still thought everything was fine, but we know she could not have been more wrong. She fell asleep peacefully already excited for tomorrow, so she could see her friends again at school.\\n\\nDuring the night, her mom came home. She had made plan while driving home, and nothing was going to stop her from fulfilling it. She went to the kitchen, while Maya was dreaming of beautiful fields with flowers and her happy mother, who was also there, smiling at her, as always. She dreamt of her perfect life, and the things she thought she knew. Her mother, in the other hand, had learnt to not be so blind to the things going on, and that’s probably what eventually drove her into depression. She knew the way things were, she always had. \\n\\nShe quietly walked past her and Maya’s father’s room on her way to Maya. She went to Maya’s bed, looked at her, and raised her knife. She was going to make everything better, it was going to be alright. \\n\\nThe next morning Maya’s whole family was laying dead in the forest deep in the grave her mother had dug the day before. Maya Looked like she was still just sleeping, except for her pale face and her white nightgown that was now covered with rips and dried blood. Her hair had became a mess after she had been dragged across the yard and into the woods. \\n\\nHer father looked like he had had a change to fight back, his knuckles were red and his eyes were open, his expression showing that he had been scared. But now, he was also covered in blood and marks from the knife.\\n\\nMaya’s mother looked a little different. Her expression was calm and she also looked almost alive, except for the wide slit in her throat. She still had the knife in her hand.\\n\\nMaya’s family laid in the forest for a while, before being found by the wild dogs in the area that started bringing body parts out of the woods. The police were called, and they found the terrifying crime scene that was once the home of a sweet family.',\n",

What is your neighbour doing, what is your friend thinking, what is going on in the forest in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of us think we know what’s happening, but we never know the full story, or the reasons that has led something to happen the way it did. The only thing we can be certain of, is the fact that we never actually know everything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day, Maya, was coming home from school, just like every other day. But this time, the kind person living with the cute dog, didn’t walk past her. The bell didn’t ring two times, the red car wasn’t parked in the same spot as always, her mom didn’t pick her up on her way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, all of these things have reasonable explanations, Maya thought. The person with the dog was probably just home sick, the bell was getting fixed, the red car was being borrowed to a friend, and her mom just had some extra work to do before coming home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or so, she thought. Completely oblivious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, the kind person with the dog had had enough of the barking and hanged the dog, the bell had been destroyed by vandals, the red car had crashed, killing the family inside. Her mom was coming home, but depressed and crying, not wanting to go on living anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maya did her homework, ate, and eventually went to bed. She still thought everything was fine, but we know she could not have been more wrong. She fell asleep peacefully already excited for tomorrow, so she could see her friends again at school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During the night, her mom came home. She had made plan while driving home, and nothing was going to stop her from fulfilling it. She went to the kitchen, while Maya was dreaming of beautiful fields with flowers and her happy mother, who was also there, smiling at her, as always. She dreamt of her perfect life, and the things she thought she knew. Her mother, in the other hand, had learnt to not be so blind to the things going on, and that’s probably what eventually drove her into depression. She knew the way things were, she always had. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She quietly walked past her and Maya’s father’s room on her way to Maya. She went to Maya’s bed, looked at her, and raised her knife. She was going to make everything better, it was going to be alright. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning Maya’s whole family was laying dead in the forest deep in the grave her mother had dug the day before. Maya Looked like she was still just sleeping, except for her pale face and her white nightgown that was now covered with rips and dried blood. Her hair had became a mess after she had been dragged across the yard and into the woods. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her father looked like he had had a change to fight back, his knuckles were red and his eyes were open, his expression showing that he had been scared. But now, he was also covered in blood and marks from the knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maya’s mother looked a little different. Her expression was calm and she also looked almost alive, except for the wide slit in her throat. She still had the knife in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maya’s family laid in the forest for a while, before being found by the wild dogs in the area that started bringing body parts out of the woods. The police were called, and they found the terrifying crime scene that was once the home of a sweet family.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn\\'t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nA familiar voice spoke:\\n\\n\\\\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I\\'ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...\\n\\nHung up.\\n\\nI thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:\\n\\n\"Now the price is paid.\"',\n",

I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- What? What are you talking abou-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-  You need to return. It is time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he &amp;quot;finished his task&amp;quot; and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. &amp;quot; I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.&amp;quot; then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent&amp;#39;s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called &amp;quot;the enlightenment&amp;quot; to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. &amp;quot;You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it&amp;#39;s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.&amp;quot; he said before disappering into the void...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn&amp;#39;t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I&amp;#39;d say they normally would ask more questions. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: &amp;quot; Read the book and you will know everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the quickest and biggest &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot; of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan&amp;#39;s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice spoke:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I&amp;#39;ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot;? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: &amp;quot;Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute&amp;quot;. I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. &amp;quot;Emma, are you in there?&amp;quot; No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now the price is paid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Snowfall in the Red River Valley (take 2)\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s cold, daddy.\" \\n\\n\"I know sweetie, now come here, stay away from the window.\"\\n\\nThe little girl shuffled towards the small heat lamp in the center of the room; blanket in tow.\\n\\n\"Daddy, why can\\'t I go out and make snow angels?\"  \\n\\nThe man sighed. \"Zoe, we\\'ve talked about this. You need to stay inside, away from the snow, do you understand me?\"\\n\\nThe little girl peaked her pouted lip out from under the blanket. A quiet shiver passed through the man, as he gazed lovingly at his daughter. The man sidled towards the wall, peaking carefully out from behind the blinds.\\n\\nThe snow was unrelenting, possibly a record setting year. Snowdrifts toppled houses, breaching an already pale horizon. An endless torrent of ice fell against the roof, shaking the flimsy trailer, as the man stood up.\\n\\nHe peered outside, adjusting his eyes to the devastating reflection of the moon across the snow.  His eyes traced familiar sihlouettes in the dark. \\'Buildings, buried cars, a mailbox possibly. Everything in sight was obscured by several feet of unbridled snow. \\n\\nA gust of wind blows ominously against the shudders, and the man retreats behind the curtain.\\n\\n\"Was that her?!\" The little girl exclaimed excitedly. \\n\\nThe man quickly shushed the child, dimming the lamp, causing  the light to crawl from the ceiling down, casting a brief projection of the two across the window and curtains. \\n\\nThe man cursed himself silently and hunched down with the child, clutching her tight. He listened anxiously, in the dark.\\n\\nThe wind seems to blow the shudders against the trailer once more, causing the child to squeak. The man brought a stiffened,  finger in front of his lips.\\n\\nThe wind wailed on, beating the unit like a drum in the night.\\n\\nSlow, disorganized Footsteps are heard just outside.\\n\\nA voice calmly starts, masked by the wind; \\n\\n\"Zoe is that you?\" -silence- \"Baby is that you? I\\'ve been looking everywhere for you.\"\\n\\nThe little girl looks up at the man confused. \\n\\n\"Daddy it\\'s her-\" she says quietly.\\n\\n\"SHH-\" \\nThe man interrupted urgently. The breath of the two hung in the air with each shaky gasp.\\n \"Remember what I told you, that\\'s. not. mommy.\"\\n\\nThe little girl pulled a neon coat off the floor and clutched it in her chest. The expression of the girl soon turned sour, she whispered\\n\\n\"But, Mommy forgot her coat-\"\\n\\n\"SHH-\" the man interrupted again, desperately hiding his fear.\\n\\n\"Zoe, honey, come outside, make some snow angels with Mommy!\"\\n\\nThe man looked down from the window, into the eyes of his daughter. Tearing up, the girl shook her head slowly. \\n\\nA small light flickered on across the street, tracing snowflakes across the backdrop of the comode. Outside, the stranger progressed in a short, stunted gait, towards the new light.\\n\\nThe woman left behind a red trail in the olive colored snow. \"Look baby, the lights came on, just like they do at the ice-rink, come play with your mommy in the snow.\" Her tone trailed off as she laid down.\\n\\nA sickening tune of brittle bones and crystallized skin are heard snapping in the cold; as her arms come over head then side to side. Silently the woman lay there, convulsing on the ground.\\n\\n\"Zoe, please, I\\'m cold, help momma make snow angels.\" \\n\\nThe man strained his neck to peak behind the curtain. The light displayed a gruesome trail of blood, leading to a deformed maroon shape, on the street-side.\\n\\nThe man coughed, almost a gag; as he averted his eyes from the scene. He collected himself, and kissed his child on the head, holding back tears. Turning back towards the window, the man was overwhelmed with terror.\\n\\nThe woman, now standing, was alone in the street. The small lamp flickering overhead, revealed the demonic gaze that was directly fixed at him. Her body contorted, and was dripping blood from exposed bone.\\n\\n\"Zoe, please baby, it\\'s cold out here, I need my jaaackett.\" the entity seemed to say, playfully; starting towards the trailer.\\n\\nThe man quickly drew the curtain, pausing for a moment to look at his daughter, before standing. \\n\\n\"Daddy wha- what are you doing?\" The girl said confused. \\n\\nThe man wiped the fear off his brow, and leaned in to kiss his daughter lovingly on the forehead. He looked calm, the daughter noticed; as he grabbed the garment from the floor.\\n\\nThe man walked towards the door, stopped and looked back at his daughter. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry Zoe, daddy\\'s gonna go play with Mommy in the snow. Please, whatever you do, don\\'t look outside sweetie.\"\\n\\nNeither angel or devil can stop the snow from falling in the Red River Valley.\\n\\n-Snexpica-',\n",

You need to stay inside, away from the snow, do you understand me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl peaked her pouted lip out from under the blanket. A quiet shiver passed through the man, as he gazed lovingly at his daughter. The man sidled towards the wall, peaking carefully out from behind the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The snow was unrelenting, possibly a record setting year. Snowdrifts toppled houses, breaching an already pale horizon. An endless torrent of ice fell against the roof, shaking the flimsy trailer, as the man stood up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He peered outside, adjusting his eyes to the devastating reflection of the moon across the snow.  His eyes traced familiar sihlouettes in the dark. &amp;#39;Buildings, buried cars, a mailbox possibly. Everything in sight was obscured by several feet of unbridled snow. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A gust of wind blows ominously against the shudders, and the man retreats behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was that her?!&amp;quot; The little girl exclaimed excitedly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man quickly shushed the child, dimming the lamp, causing  the light to crawl from the ceiling down, casting a brief projection of the two across the window and curtains. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man cursed himself silently and hunched down with the child, clutching her tight. He listened anxiously, in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wind seems to blow the shudders against the trailer once more, causing the child to squeak. The man brought a stiffened,  finger in front of his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wind wailed on, beating the unit like a drum in the night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slow, disorganized Footsteps are heard just outside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice calmly starts, masked by the wind; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe is that you?&amp;quot; -silence- &amp;quot;Baby is that you? I&amp;#39;ve been looking everywhere for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl looks up at the man confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy it&amp;#39;s her-&amp;quot; she says quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHH-&amp;quot; \\nThe man interrupted urgently. The breath of the two hung in the air with each shaky gasp.\\n &amp;quot;Remember what I told you, that&amp;#39;s. not. mommy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl pulled a neon coat off the floor and clutched it in her chest. The expression of the girl soon turned sour, she whispered&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But, Mommy forgot her coat-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHH-&amp;quot; the man interrupted again, desperately hiding his fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, honey, come outside, make some snow angels with Mommy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man looked down from the window, into the eyes of his daughter. Tearing up, the girl shook her head slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A small light flickered on across the street, tracing snowflakes across the backdrop of the comode. Outside, the stranger progressed in a short, stunted gait, towards the new light.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman left behind a red trail in the olive colored snow. &amp;quot;Look baby, the lights came on, just like they do at the ice-rink, come play with your mommy in the snow.&amp;quot; Her tone trailed off as she laid down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A sickening tune of brittle bones and crystallized skin are heard snapping in the cold; as her arms come over head then side to side. Silently the woman lay there, convulsing on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, please, I&amp;#39;m cold, help momma make snow angels.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man strained his neck to peak behind the curtain. The light displayed a gruesome trail of blood, leading to a deformed maroon shape, on the street-side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man coughed, almost a gag; as he averted his eyes from the scene. He collected himself, and kissed his child on the head, holding back tears. Turning back towards the window, the man was overwhelmed with terror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman, now standing, was alone in the street. The small lamp flickering overhead, revealed the demonic gaze that was directly fixed at him. Her body contorted, and was dripping blood from exposed bone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, please baby, it&amp;#39;s cold out here, I need my jaaackett.&amp;quot; the entity seemed to say, playfully; starting towards the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man quickly drew the curtain, pausing for a moment to look at his daughter, before standing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy wha- what are you doing?&amp;quot; The girl said confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man wiped the fear off his brow, and leaned in to kiss his daughter lovingly on the forehead. He looked calm, the daughter noticed; as he grabbed the garment from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man walked towards the door, stopped and looked back at his daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry Zoe, daddy&amp;#39;s gonna go play with Mommy in the snow. Please, whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t look outside sweetie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Neither angel or devil can stop the snow from falling in the Red River Valley.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Snexpica-&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time.

I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. \\n\\nI took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. \\n\\nI left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.\\nI went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  \\n\\nAs I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. \\n“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. \\n\\nThe clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall.

       "   'selftext': 'My name is project #124 part two\\n\\n\\n\\nPapa asked me a strange question. I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. \\n\\nJournal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!',\n",

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Journal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled.

A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways...

They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They ripped off my finger nails.

A terrifying type of happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)',\n",

You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/9ndww5\"&gt;And now the man was killing him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Sometimes the truth lies just before our eyes, but we refuse to see it. For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. \\n\\nScrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.\\n\\nThe last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.\\n\\nWhat I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.\\n\\nA voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Homo homini lupus.* Man is a wolf to man.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the truth lies just before our eyes, but we refuse to see it. For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old priest about this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Grand succès !”&lt;/em&gt; He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I remember when i was around 5, I was walking through a shopping centre with my Mum, when i saw this girl, she was a teen. It doesn\\'t seem out of the ordinary but she looked familiar, she looked like me, she looked alot like me but just older. I was shocked but kept my eyes on her as we walked in different directions, she was also looking at me, she looked really flustered, a similar looking boy was tapping on her shoulder. When i was 10 i found out what doppelgangers were, i always assumed thats what i saw that day, but deep down i had a strange feeling. I had a normal life afterwards, except my brother was born after that incident.\\n\\nFlash forward til i was 15 or 16. I was shopping with my brother because Mum said he was too young so he just had to drag me along, thats when i saw a girl...this all seemed to familiar. She seemed to be Walking with her- no- maybe...our?

It doesn&amp;#39;t seem out of the ordinary but she looked familiar, she looked like me, she looked alot like me but just older. I was shocked but kept my eyes on her as we walked in different directions, she was also looking at me, she looked really flustered, a similar looking boy was tapping on her shoulder. When i was 10 i found out what doppelgangers were, i always assumed thats what i saw that day, but deep down i had a strange feeling. I had a normal life afterwards, except my brother was born after that incident.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward til i was 15 or 16.

       "   'selftext': \"When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people's houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\",\n",

A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It&amp;#39;s me! I can&amp;#39;t believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn&amp;#39;t think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39; took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39;, again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It&amp;#39;s really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I&amp;#39;m not going down there. Can&amp;#39;t you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn&amp;#39;t move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I&amp;#39;m going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn&amp;#39;t follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn&amp;#39;t my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.\\n\\nI’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.\\n\\nShe hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence.

I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. \\n\\nI continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. \\n\\nOh God, but I love hugs.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '\\n\\n________\\n\\nThe world died in 1908. \\n\\nThat’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. \\n\\nMy father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. \\n\\nWe should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. \\n\\nI remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. \\n\\nSuddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. \\n\\nTreading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. \\n\\nSome of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures.

I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I waited an hour. Then two. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Becoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Treading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My hunting party didn’t see it that way though.

(Part Two)\\n\\n(Part One [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))\\n\\n“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. \\n\\nOctober nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.\\n\\nAfter class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”\\n\\n“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. \\n\\n“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.\\n\\nLeo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” \\n\\nI was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. \\n\\n“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.\\n\\n“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. \\n\\nI pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!\\n\\n“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.\\n\\nI could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.\\n\\n“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.\\n\\nThey were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. \\n\\nThe warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. \\n\\nBrandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. \\n\\n“Shani?” \\n\\nI choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.\\n\\nThis was not my girlfriend.\\n\\nThis was the monster that had taken her.\\n\\n——————————————————————————————————————————\\n\\nHey, everyone!

(Part Two)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Part One &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Leo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Brandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Shani?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was the monster that had taken her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;——————————————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone! It’s CelestialBiromantic here! Sorry this post got taken down. Reddit took it down. Thanks for being so understanding!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.\\n\\n11:45 PM\\n\\nI’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--**\\n\\n11:52 PM\\n\\nI’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.\\n\\n11:54 PM\\n\\nIncident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n11:59 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but\\n\\n3/8/2020 12:01 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.\\n\\n12:09 AM\\n\\nPrevious  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**\\n\\n12:29 AM\\n\\nIn  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.\\n\\n12:38 AM\\n\\nIncident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.\\n\\n12:42 AM\\n\\nCorridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?\\n\\n12:54 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.\\n\\n1:01 AM\\n\\nThe  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.\\n\\n1:08 AM\\n\\nThe screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.\\n\\n1:12 AM\\n\\nI’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.\\n\\n1:15 AM\\n\\nThe  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.\\n\\n1:18 AM\\n\\nNo  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—**\\n\\n1:24 PM\\n\\nIt  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.\\n\\n1:27 AM\\n\\nThe black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—**\\n\\nThe  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…\\n\\nHe’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—**\\n\\nDarkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.\\n\\nWhy?  Just end this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—**\\n\\nSomewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.\\n\\nPain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.\\n\\nMaddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.\\n\\nChanting.  I hear the chanting again.

Simms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case status: OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:52 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:54 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:09 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:38 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:54 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:08 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:12 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:18 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:27 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why?  Just end this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Bottom part of page crumpled and torn.

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. \\n\\nDouglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. \\n\\nA loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.',\n",

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Only I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But again, I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger.

       "\"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\""

       "  'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\",\n",

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/\"&gt;how badly things went last week&lt;/a&gt;.  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.

       "  'selftext': \"42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space. The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:\\n\\n\\n[“You are next.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw)\",\n",

Apparently it wasn&amp;#39;t just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, that&amp;#39;s why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn&amp;#39;t just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we&amp;#39;d received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Without hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don&amp;#39;t understand, but what follows is the basics of what we&amp;#39;ve deciphered so far:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;December 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;March 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;September 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though the direct messages didn&amp;#39;t make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can&amp;#39;t even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn&amp;#39;t one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn&amp;#39;t calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw\"&gt;“You are next.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. \\n\\n\\nShe started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. \\n\\n\\nThen, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. \\n\\n\\nWas it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?\\n\\n\\nI didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\",\n",

This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill&amp;#39;s dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No one would. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran out and opened the door. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“New couch?” She asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have a cat…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. \\n\\n[“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. ](https://thehorrorstore.home.blog)',\n",

       "  'selftext': ' \\n\\nI studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.',\n",

Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)',\n",

Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)',\n",

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lughnasadh.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I &lt;em&gt;dying?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Short, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The poor idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t know, Mike,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. &lt;em&gt;Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I was losing a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor handsome idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, is … is this blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy\"&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

This isn\\'t Mr. McWright anymore. I slowly moved my hand, and held on to what I could make out, was its hand. I fought for control over my own body, I don\\'t even know if it\\'s me that\\'s moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, kid!\"\\n\\nMr. Smith, Mr. McWright\\'s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it\\'s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could\\'ve happened to me, if it wasn\\'t for Mr. Smith.\\n\\nIt was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn\\'t for me, he would\\'ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn\\'t the principal speaking.\\n\\nWe heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?\\n\\nI hadn\\'t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I\\'d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn\\'t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?\\n\\nIt was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m next.\"\\n\\nI opened the door, and saw that there wasn\\'t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I\\'m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they\\'re everywhere.\\n\\nI saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. \\n\\n\"OP! Where are your classmates? Aren\\'t they supposed to be here? Didn\\'t the principal all tell you?\"\\n\\nThe principal? Wasn\\'t the principal already dead?\\n\\n\"Hey Finn, where\\'s your homeroom adviser?\"\\n\\n\"Dead, we\\'d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn\\'t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one\\'s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.\"\\n\\n\"I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?\"\\n\\nI presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.\\n\\nWe brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.\\n\\nWe were outsmarted, Finn\\'s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.\\n\\nAnd then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn\\'t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn\\'t move, couldn\\'t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it\\'s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I\\'ve ever felt. I\\'m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.\\n\\nI could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don\\'t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable.

I haven\\'t tried it yet.\\n\\nThe casket is upstairs. I haven\\'t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I\\'m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.\\n\\n\"-awful thing to happen-\"\\n\\n\"She was so young, it didn\\'t look like anything was wrong-\"\\n\\n\"-I hope the family will be okay-\"\\n\\n\"-No, I don\\'t know why she did it-\"\\n\\n\"Is that the boy who found her?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, he\\'s been sitting there since they came back.\"\\n\\n\"Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.\\n\\n\"No,\" the bartender said softly, \"but... look, son, I think I know what\\'s going through your head.\"\\n\\nI looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t go down that road. There\\'s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don\\'t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It\\'ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n\"It already has,\" I say softly, \"and it\\'s gotten my family now.\" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I\\'m not going to work. I\\'ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I\\'ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.\\n\\nI know where the Prophet will be. He\\'ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn\\'t.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for a homecoming.',\n",

I don&amp;#39;t know why I picked it up. I haven&amp;#39;t tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The casket is upstairs. I haven&amp;#39;t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-awful thing to happen-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was so young, it didn&amp;#39;t look like anything was wrong-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-I hope the family will be okay-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-No, I don&amp;#39;t know why she did it-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the boy who found her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aye, he&amp;#39;s been sitting there since they came back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don&amp;#39;t know them, but they know me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did they know her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I just did that. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don&amp;#39;t know why he isn&amp;#39;t with mom right now. I&amp;#39;m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re here in the first place. I don&amp;#39;t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven&amp;#39;t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dad&amp;#39;s hunched over the sink. He&amp;#39;s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There&amp;#39;s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first room I see is open. There&amp;#39;re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It&amp;#39;s wood. Inside is something I couldn&amp;#39;t get down from the shower in time. Granny&amp;#39;s in there, and she&amp;#39;s leading the rosary. The people she&amp;#39;s praying with have never met my family. They&amp;#39;re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven&amp;#39;t opened it yet. They&amp;#39;re all staying in granny&amp;#39;s hotel. I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve ever been to this village before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the people turns to me, frowning. He&amp;#39;s a black man. There&amp;#39;s no one of his skin color in this village, but there&amp;#39;s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She&amp;#39;d want to be buried over there, not here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she&amp;#39;s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She&amp;#39;s dressed in a beautiful white dress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boy,&amp;quot; the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glance at her. She&amp;#39;s still praying. Her eyes haven&amp;#39;t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn&amp;#39;t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. &amp;quot;Caoimhe,&amp;quot; he said, turning to my grandmother, &amp;quot;Caoimhe, your grandson is here.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can&amp;#39;t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to lose someone you&amp;#39;ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...&amp;quot; She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go.

I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone.

Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-\"*\\n\\nThere were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.\\n\\nMr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*\\n\\nA little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.\\n\\nThe Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.\\n\\nIn 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…\\n\\nI was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. \\n\\nCome 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”\\n\\n“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?\\n\\n“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”\\n\\nI was stunned into silence.\\n\\n“If you\\'re a journalist, you\\'re a bad one, but I don\\'t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO\\'s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. \\n\\nA dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will.

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;can you hear the screams.&lt;/em&gt;” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home&lt;/em&gt;?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “&lt;em&gt;I can’t see. Please, can I go home?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I can’t see…&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: &lt;em&gt;Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Come 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was stunned into silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you&amp;#39;re a journalist, you&amp;#39;re a bad one, but I don&amp;#39;t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice.

I suddenly felt very tired.

What is your neighbour doing, what is your friend thinking, what is going on in the forest in the backyard.\\n\\nOf course, some of us think we know what’s happening, but we never know the full story, or the reasons that has led something to happen the way it did. The only thing we can be certain of, is the fact that we never actually know everything.\\n\\nOne day, Maya, was coming home from school, just like every other day. But this time, the kind person living with the cute dog, didn’t walk past her. The bell didn’t ring two times, the red car wasn’t parked in the same spot as always, her mom didn’t pick her up on her way.\\n\\nWell, all of these things have reasonable explanations, Maya thought. The person with the dog was probably just home sick, the bell was getting fixed, the red car was being borrowed to a friend, and her mom just had some extra work to do before coming home.\\n\\nOr so, she thought. Completely oblivious.\\n\\nBut actually, the kind person with the dog had had enough of the barking and hanged the dog, the bell had been destroyed by vandals, the red car had crashed, killing the family inside. Her mom was coming home, but depressed and crying, not wanting to go on living anymore. \\n\\nMaya did her homework, ate, and eventually went to bed. She still thought everything was fine, but we know she could not have been more wrong. She fell asleep peacefully already excited for tomorrow, so she could see her friends again at school.\\n\\nDuring the night, her mom came home. She had made plan while driving home, and nothing was going to stop her from fulfilling it.

But this one is a little different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You can never know what’s going on around you. What is your neighbour doing, what is your friend thinking, what is going on in the forest in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of us think we know what’s happening, but we never know the full story, or the reasons that has led something to happen the way it did. The only thing we can be certain of, is the fact that we never actually know everything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day, Maya, was coming home from school, just like every other day. But this time, the kind person living with the cute dog, didn’t walk past her. The bell didn’t ring two times, the red car wasn’t parked in the same spot as always, her mom didn’t pick her up on her way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, all of these things have reasonable explanations, Maya thought. The person with the dog was probably just home sick, the bell was getting fixed, the red car was being borrowed to a friend, and her mom just had some extra work to do before coming home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or so, she thought. Completely oblivious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, the kind person with the dog had had enough of the barking and hanged the dog, the bell had been destroyed by vandals, the red car had crashed, killing the family inside. Her mom was coming home, but depressed and crying, not wanting to go on living anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maya did her homework, ate, and eventually went to bed. She still thought everything was fine, but we know she could not have been more wrong. She fell asleep peacefully already excited for tomorrow, so she could see her friends again at school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During the night, her mom came home. She had made plan while driving home, and nothing was going to stop her from fulfilling it. She went to the kitchen, while Maya was dreaming of beautiful fields with flowers and her happy mother, who was also there, smiling at her, as always. She dreamt of her perfect life, and the things she thought she knew. Her mother, in the other hand, had learnt to not be so blind to the things going on, and that’s probably what eventually drove her into depression.

       "  'selftext': 'My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn\\'t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nA familiar voice spoke:\\n\\n\\\\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I\\'ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...\\n\\nHung up.\\n\\nI thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:\\n\\n\"Now the price is paid.\"',\n",

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn&amp;#39;t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he&amp;#39;s okay, to which he replied: &amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...&amp;quot;. Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with &amp;quot;What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?&amp;quot; He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- What? What are you talking abou-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-  You need to return. It is time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he &amp;quot;finished his task&amp;quot; and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. &amp;quot; I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.&amp;quot; then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent&amp;#39;s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called &amp;quot;the enlightenment&amp;quot; to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. &amp;quot;You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it&amp;#39;s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.&amp;quot; he said before disappering into the void...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn&amp;#39;t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I&amp;#39;d say they normally would ask more questions. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: &amp;quot; Read the book and you will know everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the quickest and biggest &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot; of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan&amp;#39;s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice spoke:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I&amp;#39;ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot;? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: &amp;quot;Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute&amp;quot;. I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. &amp;quot;Emma, are you in there?&amp;quot; No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now the price is paid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

You need to stay inside, away from the snow, do you understand me?\"\\n\\nThe little girl peaked her pouted lip out from under the blanket. A quiet shiver passed through the man, as he gazed lovingly at his daughter. The man sidled towards the wall, peaking carefully out from behind the blinds.\\n\\nThe snow was unrelenting, possibly a record setting year. Snowdrifts toppled houses, breaching an already pale horizon. An endless torrent of ice fell against the roof, shaking the flimsy trailer, as the man stood up.\\n\\nHe peered outside, adjusting his eyes to the devastating reflection of the moon across the snow.  His eyes traced familiar sihlouettes in the dark. \\'Buildings, buried cars, a mailbox possibly. Everything in sight was obscured by several feet of unbridled snow. \\n\\nA gust of wind blows ominously against the shudders, and the man retreats behind the curtain.\\n\\n\"Was that her?!\" The little girl exclaimed excitedly. \\n\\nThe man quickly shushed the child, dimming the lamp, causing  the light to crawl from the ceiling down, casting a brief projection of the two across the window and curtains. \\n\\nThe man cursed himself silently and hunched down with the child, clutching her tight. He listened anxiously, in the dark.\\n\\nThe wind seems to blow the shudders against the trailer once more, causing the child to squeak. The man brought a stiffened,  finger in front of his lips.\\n\\nThe wind wailed on, beating the unit like a drum in the night.\\n\\nSlow, disorganized Footsteps are heard just outside.\\n\\nA voice calmly starts, masked by the wind; \\n\\n\"Zoe is that you?\" -silence- \"Baby is that you? I\\'ve been looking everywhere for you.\"\\n\\nThe little girl looks up at the man confused. \\n\\n\"Daddy it\\'s her-\" she says quietly.\\n\\n\"SHH-\" \\nThe man interrupted urgently. The breath of the two hung in the air with each shaky gasp.\\n \"Remember what I told you, that\\'s. not. mommy.\"\\n\\nThe little girl pulled a neon coat off the floor and clutched it in her chest. The expression of the girl soon turned sour, she whispered\\n\\n\"But, Mommy forgot her coat-\"\\n\\n\"SHH-\" the man interrupted again, desperately hiding his fear.\\n\\n\"Zoe, honey, come outside, make some snow angels with Mommy!\"\\n\\nThe man looked down from the window, into the eyes of his daughter. Tearing up, the girl shook her head slowly. \\n\\nA small light flickered on across the street, tracing snowflakes across the backdrop of the comode. Outside, the stranger progressed in a short, stunted gait, towards the new light.\\n\\nThe woman left behind a red trail in the olive colored snow. \"Look baby, the lights came on, just like they do at the ice-rink, come play with your mommy in the snow.\" Her tone trailed off as she laid down.\\n\\nA sickening tune of brittle bones and crystallized skin are heard snapping in the cold; as her arms come over head then side to side. Silently the woman lay there, convulsing on the ground.\\n\\n\"Zoe, please, I\\'m cold, help momma make snow angels.\" \\n\\nThe man strained his neck to peak behind the curtain. The light displayed a gruesome trail of blood, leading to a deformed maroon shape, on the street-side.\\n\\nThe man coughed, almost a gag; as he averted his eyes from the scene. He collected himself, and kissed his child on the head, holding back tears. Turning back towards the window, the man was overwhelmed with terror.\\n\\nThe woman, now standing, was alone in the street. The small lamp flickering overhead, revealed the demonic gaze that was directly fixed at him. Her body contorted, and was dripping blood from exposed bone.\\n\\n\"Zoe, please baby, it\\'s cold out here, I need my jaaackett.\" the entity seemed to say, playfully; starting towards the trailer.\\n\\nThe man quickly drew the curtain, pausing for a moment to look at his daughter, before standing. \\n\\n\"Daddy wha- what are you doing?\" The girl said confused. \\n\\nThe man wiped the fear off his brow, and leaned in to kiss his daughter lovingly on the forehead. He looked calm, the daughter noticed; as he grabbed the garment from the floor.\\n\\nThe man walked towards the door, stopped and looked back at his daughter. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry Zoe, daddy\\'s gonna go play with Mommy in the snow. Please, whatever you do, don\\'t look outside sweetie.\"\\n\\nNeither angel or devil can stop the snow from falling in the Red River Valley.\\n\\n-Snexpica-',\n",

You need to stay inside, away from the snow, do you understand me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl peaked her pouted lip out from under the blanket. A quiet shiver passed through the man, as he gazed lovingly at his daughter. The man sidled towards the wall, peaking carefully out from behind the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The snow was unrelenting, possibly a record setting year. Snowdrifts toppled houses, breaching an already pale horizon. An endless torrent of ice fell against the roof, shaking the flimsy trailer, as the man stood up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He peered outside, adjusting his eyes to the devastating reflection of the moon across the snow.  His eyes traced familiar sihlouettes in the dark. &amp;#39;Buildings, buried cars, a mailbox possibly. Everything in sight was obscured by several feet of unbridled snow. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A gust of wind blows ominously against the shudders, and the man retreats behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was that her?!&amp;quot; The little girl exclaimed excitedly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man quickly shushed the child, dimming the lamp, causing  the light to crawl from the ceiling down, casting a brief projection of the two across the window and curtains. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man cursed himself silently and hunched down with the child, clutching her tight. He listened anxiously, in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wind seems to blow the shudders against the trailer once more, causing the child to squeak. The man brought a stiffened,  finger in front of his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wind wailed on, beating the unit like a drum in the night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slow, disorganized Footsteps are heard just outside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice calmly starts, masked by the wind; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe is that you?&amp;quot; -silence- &amp;quot;Baby is that you? I&amp;#39;ve been looking everywhere for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl looks up at the man confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy it&amp;#39;s her-&amp;quot; she says quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHH-&amp;quot; \\nThe man interrupted urgently. The breath of the two hung in the air with each shaky gasp.\\n &amp;quot;Remember what I told you, that&amp;#39;s. not. mommy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl pulled a neon coat off the floor and clutched it in her chest. The expression of the girl soon turned sour, she whispered&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But, Mommy forgot her coat-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHH-&amp;quot; the man interrupted again, desperately hiding his fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, honey, come outside, make some snow angels with Mommy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man looked down from the window, into the eyes of his daughter. Tearing up, the girl shook her head slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A small light flickered on across the street, tracing snowflakes across the backdrop of the comode. Outside, the stranger progressed in a short, stunted gait, towards the new light.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman left behind a red trail in the olive colored snow. &amp;quot;Look baby, the lights came on, just like they do at the ice-rink, come play with your mommy in the snow.&amp;quot; Her tone trailed off as she laid down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A sickening tune of brittle bones and crystallized skin are heard snapping in the cold; as her arms come over head then side to side. Silently the woman lay there, convulsing on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, please, I&amp;#39;m cold, help momma make snow angels.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man strained his neck to peak behind the curtain. The light displayed a gruesome trail of blood, leading to a deformed maroon shape, on the street-side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man coughed, almost a gag; as he averted his eyes from the scene. He collected himself, and kissed his child on the head, holding back tears. Turning back towards the window, the man was overwhelmed with terror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman, now standing, was alone in the street. The small lamp flickering overhead, revealed the demonic gaze that was directly fixed at him. Her body contorted, and was dripping blood from exposed bone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoe, please baby, it&amp;#39;s cold out here, I need my jaaackett.&amp;quot; the entity seemed to say, playfully; starting towards the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man quickly drew the curtain, pausing for a moment to look at his daughter, before standing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy wha- what are you doing?&amp;quot; The girl said confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man wiped the fear off his brow, and leaned in to kiss his daughter lovingly on the forehead. He looked calm, the daughter noticed; as he grabbed the garment from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man walked towards the door, stopped and looked back at his daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry Zoe, daddy&amp;#39;s gonna go play with Mommy in the snow. Please, whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t look outside sweetie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Neither angel or devil can stop the snow from falling in the Red River Valley.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Snexpica-&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time. I pulled into the parking garage and found a spot not too clogged with the amount of cars that would surprise anyone considering the time. With a turn of my key in the ignition, my car shut down with a tired gasp. \\nI approached the doors of the airport surprised at the amount of inactivity in the drop-off zone. I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. \\n\\nI took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. \\n\\nI left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.\\nI went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  \\n\\nAs I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. \\n“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. \\n\\nThe clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall. I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.\\n\\nI exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before. I continued in my day contemplating what just happened until I sat down in the Boeing 737. The man I was sitting next to had a musky smelling cologne,white wrinkly fingers and some black dress shoes.',\n",

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. \\n\\nJournal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!',\n",

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years.

A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge.

They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)',\n",

It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You.&lt;/em&gt;”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/9ndww5\"&gt;And now the man was killing him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Sometimes the truth lies just before our eyes, but we refuse to see it. For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. \\n\\nScrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.\\n\\nThe last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.\\n\\nWhat I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children.

For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old priest about this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Grand succès !”&lt;/em&gt; He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left.

He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people's houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\",\n",

I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa&amp;#39;s basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It&amp;#39;s me! I can&amp;#39;t believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn&amp;#39;t think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39; took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said &amp;#39;Antonio&amp;#39;, again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It&amp;#39;s really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I&amp;#39;m not going down there. Can&amp;#39;t you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn&amp;#39;t move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I&amp;#39;m going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn&amp;#39;t follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn&amp;#39;t my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.\\n\\nI’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.\\n\\nShe hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence. Her eyes meet mine and I see my chance. I opened my arms wide and she fell into them, allowing me to wrap her up in a tight embrace.\\n\\nI immediately felt the warm of her body pressed against mine. I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. \\n\\nI continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. \\n\\nOh God, but I love hugs.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\n\\n________\\n\\nThe world died in 1908. \\n\\nThat’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. \\n\\nMy father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. \\n\\nWe should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. \\n\\nI remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. \\n\\nSuddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. \\n\\nTreading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. \\n\\nSome of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. \\n\\nThanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. \\n\\nWhen we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality.

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The world died in 1908. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I waited an hour. Then two. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Becoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Treading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So instead I made those men a promise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food.

(Part Two)\\n\\n(Part One [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))\\n\\n“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. \\n\\nOctober nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.\\n\\nAfter class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”\\n\\n“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. \\n\\n“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.\\n\\nLeo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” \\n\\nI was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. \\n\\n“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.\\n\\n“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. \\n\\nI pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!\\n\\n“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.\\n\\nI could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.\\n\\n“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.\\n\\nThey were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. \\n\\nThe warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. \\n\\nBrandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. \\n\\n“Shani?” \\n\\nI choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.\\n\\nThis was not my girlfriend.\\n\\nThis was the monster that had taken her.\\n\\n——————————————————————————————————————————\\n\\nHey, everyone!

(Part Two)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Part One &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Leo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Brandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Shani?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was the monster that had taken her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;——————————————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone! It’s CelestialBiromantic here! Sorry this post got taken down. Reddit took it down. Thanks for being so understanding!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': ' **--Case #40157J –Paranormal Research Division--**\\n\\n**Confiscated from Cairo police department on 3/8/2020**\\n\\n**Journal entries from Canadian-American researcher Steven K. Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.\\n\\n11:45 PM\\n\\nI’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--**\\n\\n11:52 PM\\n\\nI’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.\\n\\n11:54 PM\\n\\nIncident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n11:59 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but\\n\\n3/8/2020 12:01 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.\\n\\n12:09 AM\\n\\nPrevious  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**\\n\\n12:29 AM\\n\\nIn  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.\\n\\n12:38 AM\\n\\nIncident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.\\n\\n12:42 AM\\n\\nCorridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?\\n\\n12:54 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.\\n\\n1:01 AM\\n\\nThe  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.\\n\\n1:08 AM\\n\\nThe screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.\\n\\n1:12 AM\\n\\nI’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.\\n\\n1:15 AM\\n\\nThe  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.\\n\\n1:18 AM\\n\\nNo  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—**\\n\\n1:24 PM\\n\\nIt  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.\\n\\n1:27 AM\\n\\nThe black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—**\\n\\nThe  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…\\n\\nHe’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—**\\n\\nDarkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.\\n\\nWhy?  Just end this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—**\\n\\nSomewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.\\n\\nPain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.\\n\\nMaddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.\\n\\nChanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.\\n\\nWould  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.

Simms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case status: OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:52 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:54 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:09 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:38 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:54 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:08 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:12 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:18 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:27 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why?  Just end this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Bottom part of page crumpled and torn.

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. \\n\\nDouglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. \\n\\nA loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.',\n",

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Only I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But again, I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Douglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Douglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6.

       "'“Alright, guys, we will take a short break now and begin our hike once everyone is ready. Toilet is down the hall, last door on your right” I said after Lavinia, Toby, and Mimi walked into the family cabin after me. Toby took in his surrounding and nodded in approval while Lavinia rushed to the toilet, she was probably holding in her pee for the past hour. I dropped my hand carry next to the black faux leather couch before sitting down, trying to relax a little after driving for the past 2 hours.\\n\\nToby and Mimi spent some time exploring the cabin, looking at pictures of previous family gatherings in the cabin while remarking how goofy I looked when I was young. I laughed in response to their teasing. Lavinia returned from the toilet shortly after, volunteered to show them around, clearly still remembering her way around the place from her trip here 2 months ago to meet my family. I took the opportunity to double check the contents of my hiking bag, making sure I have everything we need for our 2 hours hike to the top of the hill. \\n\\nToby returned about 10 minutes later, while I was on the couch, dozing off without realizing it. He plopped down right beside me, jolting me awake. “Oops! Sorry, Mel. Didn’t realize you were sleeping!’ Toby said apologetically. \\n\\nI smiled at him and said, “Don’t worry about it. I didn’t realize it myself.” I chuckled and Toby laughed. I zipped my bag and place it back at the side of the couch and turn to Toby.\\n\\n“So…. Can I see it? Please, please, please!” I pleaded him, inching closer to him in an attempt to pressure him into relenting. \\n\\n“Shh!!!!!” Toby placed his finger in front of his mouth while frantically look around the room. He glared at me briefly after making sure that no one was around us while I smiled sheepishly, knowing that he is yielding to my request. He shuffled slightly on the couch to produce a small black box out of his pocket. He passed me the box and I opened it and there it was, a beautiful ring with rose gold and platinum bands, and a diamond etched right in the middle. \\n\\n“Nice!” I said, closing the box and returning it to him before Mimi returns to the living room. “Are you nervous about your proposal later?”\\n\\n“More nervous than I’d expect actually. But I am also very excited.” Toby beamed. I smiled and added, “Of course you are! It is finally happening, man! I am truly happy for you guys!” I patted him on the shoulder before moving back to my side of the couch. I look at his face, noting how genuinely joyful he really seemed, feeling happy for my old friend for finally proposing to his soulmate. \\n\\n“What about you, Mel? How are things with V?” he asked, concern and care in his eyes. I look at him for a moment before turning to face the front, looking at nothing in particular. “She is great, Toby. She is really supportive and patient with me, giving me space when I needed it but doesn’t hesitate to let me know when I am doing something damaging to myself.” I said, and added after a long pause, “I still miss him, Toby…” wiping away a tear running down my cheek.\\n\\n“Of course you do, Mel. Nobody go through what you’ve been through unscathed. Losing someone you love to a freak accident like that… I don’t even know what I would do if I ever lose Mimi.” Toby said, head bowing down, fidgeting with his fingers.\\n\\nI nodded in agreement, memories of Jake and our happy memories together playing in my mind. Our diving trips to Maldives, the inside jokes that we shared, and the future that we envisioned together. Then V came into my mind, her sweet smile and warm personality, her soothing voice whenever she held me on our bed when I cry myself to sleep, thinking about Jake. Somehow, the thought of V made me feel lighter, the weight on my shoulder is still there but they somehow feel more bearable. “But I am feeling much better now.” I turned to him and smile genuinely, “You know, I feel like I am ready to move on now, I think that’s what Jake would’ve wanted as well.” \\n\\n“Yea, I think he wou…” Toby stopped mid-sentence, as laughter drifted out of the upper level of the cabin, seconds later, Lavinia and Mimi were moving towards the staircase, both of them changed into a looser t-shirt and short pants, apparently all set for the hike. They were giggling, sharing some inside joke that only both are aware of at this moment. \\n\\nToby winked at me, before leaving the couch to approach his would-be fiancée who has no idea the surprise that is waiting for her at the top of the hill. I look at Lavinia and when our eyes meet, we share a smile, and it occur to me right at that moment, how much I truly love her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe hike itself was relaxing, as it is a pretty straightforward track with very little obstacles and slopes. We took our sweet time walking up the well-trodden path, taking in our luscious green surrounding, basking in the sound of birds chirping, and breathing in the fresh air that we could not get in the city. We even hummed a few songs along the way, talking about the good ol’ days of our college lives, and laughing at how Toby had to leave his lights on for a whole week after he watched the “lights out” horror short clip. He is usually embarrassed by this story and hated it whenever we brought it up. However, today, he just laughed along with the rest of us. I guess his excitement for his proposal later wouldn’t be dampen by his embarrassment. \\n\\nAbout halfway through our 2-hour hike, I started hearing a strange noise coming from the woods to our right. It was a sound that I have never heard before in my entire life. I turn my head towards the direction the sound is coming from, trying to discern what it was. It was a low, grumbling bellow, not unlike a deep trumpet sound. However, it was also interweaved with what sounded like low pitched flute sound and metallic scraping sound. It didn’t sound natural and the fact that it was coming from within the forest made me feel uneasy. Somehow, it made me feel… suffocated… like something was pushing against me for that brief moment. I realized this because I instinctively gasped for air after a while. \\n\\nShocked by my sudden gasp for air, I came back to my senses and started looking around me, at my friends and girlfriend. I saw that they were equally puzzled and baffled as I. Lavinia even seemed afraid, her eyes widened, and I could see a couple of sweat started trickling down her forehead. She inched closer to me, wrapping her hands around my left arm. I turned to her and gave her a hug, in an attempt to comfort both her and me. The warmth of her body against mine seemed to calm me down a bit. \\n\\nThe sound eventually stopped, slowly fading away, until eventually, there was nothing but silence. Only then did I noticed that the birds and insects have stopped chirping and the whole forest was dead silence, as if someone has pressed the mute button. Moments later, the chirping sound came on once again and the forest gradually became alive with the sound of its inhabitants. \\n\\nMimi was the first to break the silence, “What the hell was that, guys?”. I shook my head and turn to Lavinia and Toby. Nobody seems to have the slightest clue as to what made that sound. \\n\\n“It wasn’t like anything I have ever heard before.” Lavinia said after a while, “It sounded… ominous.” All of us nodded in agreement.\\n\\n“I don’t like this, baby. Can we please go back to the cabin?” Lavinia’s clutch tightens now, I can sense the fear in her trembling voice. I’d be lying if I said the sound didn’t affect me, it somehow instilled fear in me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off here. I was about to agree with her when I made eye contact with Toby and is suddenly reminded of his plan for proposal. \\n\\nToby looked disappointed and scared but somehow forced himself to try and convince us to keep to our initial plan. “Maybe it was nothing guys, Maybe a tree fell somewhere in the forest, or… or… someone is building a cabin or a hut in the middle of the forest.” He tried his best to think of an excuse to convince us to resume our hike towards the hilltop, but from the sound of his voice, even he has a hard time believing himself.\\n\\nI braved myself and was about to help Toby think of an excuse to proceed with our plan, but Mimi beat me to the punch by saying, “Let’s go back to the cabin, Toby, I am scared as well. I don’t like what we just heard. I don’t know how to say this, but somehow, the sound just now made me feel… hopeless, made me feel like I am trapped, in a vast darkness where I am all alone and there is nowhere to escape…” then she added, “I feel stupid now that I said it out loud, I don’t even know how I conjured up all these feelings from just the sound alone, but that’s exactly how I felt just now. It just felt… wrong.” \\n\\nToby looked as if he wanted to say something, then he turned and look at me while I was racking my brain to figure out how to come to my friend’s aid, hoping to salvage his plan for the evening. Finally, he admits defeat and said, “Fine, let’s go back to the cabin then.”. I feel sorry for him, but I guess he knows the plan is ruined now and there is no point forcing it. To be perfectly honest, even I wanted to leave the place as soon as possible and to go back to somewhere where I would feel safe. To go back to the cabin and hide behind the walls. The thought of putting some solid wood construct between us and the forest made me feel slightly safer. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn our way back, I gradually fall back to walk beside Toby, letting Lavinia and Mimi walk together in front of us. When they are out of earshot, I whispered to Toby, “Sorry that your plan is ruined, man.” Toby nodded as he walked, “It’s alright, the stupid sound already ruined the evening, making everyone feels uneasy and what not, the evening is not special anymore. I will come out with another plan for the proposal.” He turned and winked at me and I smiled at him. He has always been like that, someone who knows how to pick himself up and adapt to the situation. I sometimes wish I am like him, especially after I lost Jake, maybe then I would have gotten back on my feet sooner, rather than making everyone around me feel miserable and suffered with me.  \\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, while Toby and I were quietly whispering and planning for an alternate plan for his proposal, we heard a gasp coming from the girls who were about 20 feet in front of us. We quickly picked up our pace and caught up with the girls. \\n\\nI could feel my jaw drop the moment I caught up to them and looked ahead. All four of us just stood there in utter bewilderment, none of us made a sound. \\n\\nWhat appeared before us felt like it was lifted straight out of a surreal painting. The trees were twisted in some weird and impossible angle, some going in spiral, while others… seem to grow in and out of itself. Worse still are many others that I couldn’t even describe. There was even one tree that always seemed to be within my eyesight for a time, no matter where I look, it is always right there, smack dab in the middle of my vision, like it was actually an organism that could move around, trying to seek my attention. I tried rubbing my eyes, but it was still there when I was done. It only went away after a while, finally settling down on a spot towards the back of a bunch of… pyramid-shaped… trees? \\n\\nThe colors were also not the colors that you would come to expect from a tree, some were a mixture of yellow and red, some were your typical brown but with a hint of rainbow swirl in patches all over it, there were even some that just look like diamond trees, sparkling and glinting as it reflected the sunlight that shined upon it. \\n\\n“What the fuck…” I heard myself said. \\n\\nThe whole scene made me dizzy, both because the angle and dimension seem to be wrong, so illogical. The depth perception did not make sense at certain places. Plants that are right in front of us seems to be so far away while trees that are seemingly 12 feet tall has a missing top the moment you try to look up at the treetop, but would resume to normal again the moment you look down. The whole thing seemed like a fever dream, but I couldn’t tear my gaze away from the surreal sight before me. It was unbelievable, it was otherworldly, it was… mesmerizing. \\n\\nAfter a while, my mind couldn’t take it anymore and I vomited due to the nauseating sight. The others didn’t fare any better than I as Lavinia had to sit down on the path to steady herself, probably because she was feeling dizzy from the impossible angles. Toby was also bending over and hurling his lunch over at a patch of weird translucent grass while Mimi just closed her eyes, trying to steady herself by closing her eyes and reached out to both sides with her hands, in an attempt to steady herself. \\n\\nWhen we finally settled down and composed ourselves, Mimi asked “We are on the right path right?”, turning to each of us. I nodded to her, tracing the hiking path with my eyes, from where we came from to the weird sight before us and along the path leading deeper into the fever forest. Somehow, the path is still discernible from the orgy of colors and weird shapes, although the path was also somewhat altered, now looking like… like it was floating a couple feet off the actual ground, and somehow it seemed to be intangible, like it was made of immaterial object. “There is only one clear path through this place, so yes, we are indeed on the right track….” I muttered, “Taking the long way and going through the forest might be dangerous, none of us are very experienced hikers, and we could easily get lost in there. Besides, we don’t know what else we might find in the woods itself.” I gestured towards our surrounding, suggesting that things might get even weirder in the forest. \\n\\n“I think we have no choice but to press forward.” I said reluctantly after a while. The rest of the group just nodded in silence. \\n\\nLavinia and I clutch our hands tightly and walk closely together, and I could see Toby and Mimi doing the same behind us. We were careful not to touch anything around us. As we took our first step on the seemingly immaterial path, it felt as though we were stepping on clouds, or at least that’s what I imagined stepping on a cloud would feel like. It felt unreal, like I was stepping on something that couldn’t support my weight, but when I thought my leg was going to go right through the path itself, it held my weight as well as a concrete path would. It takes some getting used to, walking on this soft, cloud-like path, and all of us were stumbling like a toddler learning to walk, but eventually, we got a better hang of it, still stumbling through but also being able to better balance ourselves.\\n\\nAs we walk, I couldn’t help but stare in amazement at some of the weird and wonderful flora in our vicinity. It was fascinating that these plants actually exist, right here before us. Are they some undiscovered species or are they some weird mutation of existing species? How did they appear all of a sudden when they weren’t even here just under half an hour again? Did we unwittingly inhaled some psychedelic drugs? The more I think about it, the more my brain hurts, struggling to figure out how something so impossible could have happened to us, right here at this moment. Part of me wanted to slap myself silly just to make sure I am actually awake, and this is all real. However, the warmth of Lavinia’s hand in my grip and the vividness of our surrounding are all too real to be anything but reality. There is no way any human mind could conjure up such fantastic images, dream or not. Everyone walk in silence and I am pretty sure they are just as amazed by what is unfolding before us as I am. At some point during our bizarre journey, I heard Lavinia muttered “It’s so beautiful”, her eyes showing a childlike wonderment at the wondrous scenery before us. Despite the situation that we found ourselves in, the lack of immediate danger has somehow calmed us, and we can’t help but gradually began to appreciate the view of a lifetime before us. \\n\\nAs we are following a bend along the extraordinary path, something screeched ahead and flew at us at breakneck speed. It shot upward at a right-angle right before it collides with Mimi. It was eventually obscured by the trees as it flew ever upward. I think I saw a paper-thin flying dreamcatcher-esque thing in hot pursuit of a rather normal looking bird. To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if that is indeed what I saw, I guess anything is possible in this forest. Mimi, taken aback by the sudden appearance of the two creatures, lost her balance on the path and fell on the forest floor.\\n\\n“Shit!” Mimi cursed, trying to get up from the floor. Toby quickly turned around to extend his hand to help Mimi to climb up the path again. Realizing he doesn’t have a solid footing to pull her up and fearing he might lose his balance as well, attempted to step down from the path to help her up. \\n\\nRight then, the bellowing sound that we heard earlier returned, sounding closer than before. This time, I could catch some details that I missed earlier, details that gave me goosebumps. Underneath the metallic scrapping sound, the low-pitched flute, and deep bellowing, there seem to be an eerie plopping sound that occurs at irregular interval and faint puffing sounds that is repeated in regular interval. Strange as it seems, the regularity of the puffing sound reminds me of breathing. \\n\\nAll of us stopped whatever we were doing and just look all around us, trying to determine the source of the sound. Shortly after, Toby snapped back to his senses and once again tried to help his would-be fiancée. \\n\\nThings escalated quickly right then. Everything around us instantly changed. The bright, vibrant-colored forest around us instantly warped into metallic silver and black-colored plants. They took on a biomechanical quality now, covered by leathery textures with strange pipes and tubes fused to the trees themselves. Some pipes and tubes have steam coming out from them. They now pulsate with a sickening brown hue, giving out an eerie glow that also serves as a light source around us. The illumination of silver and black leather by a brown hue is not exactly a decent and appetizing sight, it made my stomach feel queasy. \\n\\nI stifled a gasp, taken aback by the sudden change in our surrounding, not knowing how to react to such transformation in our environment. Mimi was stunned by this sudden transformation and she frantically tried to get up from the ground. Before Toby could get off the path however, Lavinia tackled him and held him down. He was surprised by her sudden attack and stared at Lavinia. She wouldn’t budge but instead, gestured him to look around the forest floor, the forest floor was already filled with black goo that was not there mere seconds ago, now looking like a black tar pit that bubbles all around us. The black goo was gushing out from the ground itself, quickly covering the path and forming a shallow pool of mud everywhere.\\n\\nMimi started screaming and crying in pain as she struggled to get up from the ground, but the black goo seems to refuse to let her go, sucking her and holding her in place. She tried her hardest to scramble to her feet but to no avail, and soon Mimi was sliced to hundreds of pieces within seconds, with no visible assailant in sight. Smaller pieces of her submerged into the goo while bigger pieces of her was being chewed and swallowed by mouths that suddenly appeared in the mud. \\n\\nWe were horrified by the sudden turn of event before us, the sudden loss of a dear friend within seconds and the instantaneous escalation of a life-threatening situation. Toby started howling, trying to get back on his feet but Lavinia, being the well-trained gym trainer, has the upper hand and was still subduing him, while I, acting on instinct, rushed over to help Lavinia, making sure that he doesn’t jump into the black goo in a foolish attempt to save his now completely vanished girlfriend. \\n\\nToby was crying and yelling, “NOOOOOOOOOOOO! LET ME GOOOOOOOOO!!! I NEED TO HELP HERRRRRRR!!!!”, tears streaming down his cheeks. Lavinia was hugging him tightly now, hoping to at least calm him down a little. All the while, I am still trying to make sense of the whole situation while I pinned his legs to the ground. I couldn’t stop thinking just what the hell is happening to us, where are we, and how are we going to get out of here. \\n\\nToby slowly stopped struggling, coming to his senses and realizing that his girlfriend is now gone. Sensing Toby’s gradual tranquility, Lavinia and I slowly let go of him and help him to his feet. The three of us were sobbing, heart pumping, and clueless about what can we do to escape from this hellish nightmare. Everything around us is the leathery black and silver biomechanical trees, the previous amazement that we had for the place gone without a trace, replaced with nothing but apprehension, confusion, and the thought of survival. \\n\\n“We need to get out of here!” cried Lavinia while she stood up and started leading the way. Toby and I follow suit and I look down at the black goo along the forest floor as we walk. It seemed so calm now, no sign of any potential danger or deadly things lurking there. Whatever it was, it was either vanished or lying in wait, ready to ambush whatever that enters their territory. \\n\\nWe tread carefully along the path that was fortunately still there. It has turned into a more tangible and solid path, albeit one also with leathery texture. The only source of light now comes from the strange pulsating glow that comes from the otherworldly trees that lined both sides of the path. They were strong enough to illuminate the path, for us to be sure where we are stepping. We started running along the path, too fearful to stay at the same place for long, afraid that some unknown things would attack us again. \\n\\nI turned to look up at the sky while I was running, but was met with nothing but darkness, darkness so dark it seems as though all the lights were sucked into it, never to be able to escape. Darkness so oppressive that it felt like it was pressing down on us, about to suffocate and crush us into pulps. I feel as though the sky was gone, the entire sky, along with the clouds and sun, were sucked and consumed by this infinite blackness. I could feel my heart racing, feeling so terrified, feeling as though something was in the darkness on top of our head, ready to descent upon us at a moment’s notice. I forced myself to tear my gaze away from the sunless sky, to focus on the path ahead. To focus on survival.\\n\\nAs we progress further along the path, the forests on both sides began to inch closer to us, it was imperceptible at first, but it started becoming more obvious as they close in on us at a faster pace. “Hurry guys! The walls are closing in!!!!” Toby shouted from behind me, survival instinct and adrenaline kicking in, momentarily forgetting the death of Mimi and focusing on escaping this hell hole. And he is right, the leathery trees have somehow merged into solid walls, walls that stretched on and on for the entire length of our path, walls that seem determined to crush and squash us, as they pick up the speed of closing in. My lungs are burning at this point, my legs are arching, I have never run this fast for this long in my entire life. \\n\\nThen I heard a sickening plop behind us, a plop so loud it reverberates through the entire length of the leather corridor, a plop that sounded like a wet steak being thrown on a slab, ready to be cut. Then a loud puff, like the breathing sound that I faintly heard earlier. And then I smelled it, as the air travel down the corridor, the smell of rot, of dead rats and road kills, but somehow, there was a hint of sweetness in it, the sweetness reminds me of honey. The plopping sounds keep repeating behind us, at a longer interval initially, but became more frequent, as though something is picking up speed and chasing us. None of us dared to look behind, for fear of losing our footing on the ground, and afraid to discover what new monstrosity is now pursuing us. \\n\\nWe kept running for our lives and shortly after, we began to see light ahead of us, light the color of evening sky, light that symbolizes hope in this nightmare dreamscape. Somehow, despite our absolute fatigue, we kept going. All three of us are pushing our limit now, our speed noticeably slower than before, we gasped for air, relying only on adrenaline and the desire to live to fuel ourselves. The walls are just within arm’s reach from us now, threatening to swallow us soon if we couldn’t make it out in time, I could see the walls squirming next to us, expanding and retracting, as though it was breathing. The leathery texture looks sickeningly alive, making a wet squishing sound as it squirms. All the while, the sickening “plop” keeps getting closer behind us, threatening to catch up to us soon.\\n\\nWhen we finally reached the end of the tunnel, the walls are only a couple of feet away from being sealed off, Lavinia and I managed to squeeze past the enclosing wall and got our feet firmly planted on a world that we know so well, surrounded by forest that are illuminated by the beautiful dusk sunlight. Toby could only squeeze himself halfway through before the walls fully enclose upon his waistline, Lavinia and I both rushed back to help pull him out of the black and silver mass, hoping against all hope that we will be able to save our friend in time. My hands firmly pushing against the leathery wall that somehow suspended in mid-air, it felt moist and warm to my touch, the walls pulsing, as though there is a heart beating underneath the mass. All the while, we are pulling Toby out while he struggles to push himself out of the wall’s tight grasp.\\n\\nFinally, we managed to get him out and all three of us landed squarely on the forest floor. I breathed a sigh of relief, and quickly got back to my feet, and helped Lavinia and Toby get on theirs, hoping to leave this nightmare behind as soon as possible. I quickly turn around to get one last look at the unbelievable sight before we hightail it back to our cabin. \\n\\nAnd right there in front of us, the biochemical portal twisted and retracted away, revealing the tunnel that it was hiding just seconds ago. All of us gasp, chill running through my body, I couldn’t believe what appears before my eyes. \\n\\nThis is the creature that makes the plopping and puffing sound, the one that was stalking us through the otherworldly tunnel. It was a horrific sight. There are no distinct features that I could recognize, nothing that gives me a sense of familiarity, to let me know what we are dealing with here. Some of its features don’t even make sense to me. It was a huge blob of flesh and leather that seem to have fused together. Here and there I could see flesh throbbing while the leathery textured part of it glistened under the waning evening sunlight. I could find no facial features on it, no eyes, nose, mouths, or ears that humans are familiar with. The whole mass is constantly squirming, expanding, and contracting, not unlike the walls around it. I could see several leathery pipes extending from behind it, with smoke coming out from them, smoke so thick that black goo drip from them. Several appendages extend from its body, they follow no symmetrical order but seem to grow haphazardly around its body. One of them ends with a claw, a couple of them seem to end in a jumbled mess, half-formed even, while the others ended with drill-like feature.\\n\\nSeveral blister-like features around its body popped and fizzled as we stood staring at it, making a “plop” sound. Every time a blister popped; another would appear elsewhere on the thing’s body. The “plop” sound that I thought was its movement along the path, in hot pursuit of us. But right now, I have a feeling that it was just toying with us in there rather than chasing us, I don’t think it follows our rule of movement, our laws of physics. It was nowhere near us when we escaped from the tunnel but the moment we left the passage, it is right there, behind us. It might be able to go anywhere it wants at a moment’s notice in that tunnel but it chose to taunt us instead, to inspire fear in us. \\n\\nSuddenly, I became aware of the sound of Toby vomiting beside me, I turned to look at him briefly before turning back to face that…. thing. When I saw it, I too struggled to hold down my vomit. There, at the bottom right of the creature’s body, I could clearly see Mimi’s head, somehow fused with its body. Her head turned around and smiled at us, not an eerie smile, but a peaceful and inviting smile, as if she is genuinely happy at that moment, to be part of the horrible abomination. \\n\\nThe creature’s clawed limb then began to claw at itself, engaging in self-mutilation. Liquid that I assumed was blood started oozing out of its wound. The sound of it clawing at itself and blood streaming down its wound was sickening. It then tears off a small chunk of its body and threw it at us. We instinctively duck out of the way but realize that nothing came through to our world. I righted myself and look at it again, this time I swear I could see some movement at the middle of its body. I couldn’t tell with my eyes, but I could feel it in my mind, the creature… it was smirking at us! It was as though it is letting us know that it cannot cross over to our world and that we are lucky that it lets us live for another day. That we were at its mercy. I got chills and started shivering. \\n\\nAnd then it began to raise another appendage, one of the ones that ends in a jumble of mess. It pointed at each of us in succession. Even though there was no mouth that I could see, I can hear it calling our name, hear it with my ears, as though it is standing right next to me. “Tobias… Melanie… Lavinia…” in a clear voice that sounded neither male nor female. Its voice was disturbingly human, strangely warm and soothing. \\n\\nA thousand thoughts ran through my mind at the mention of my name, different ways I imagined I would die at the hands of this creature. How I would be trapped in the tunnel with it, how it would use one of its many appendages to violate me, to rip me apart, to torture me, to consume me. How I would be oppressed and crushed in the tunnel by the darkness and the void. How I would be absorbed by the wall. How I would get sucked in and devoured by the black goo. Ways that I never imagined a human could die flashed in my mind. They keep flashing and flashing, each one more gruesome and grotesque than the one before. I have never been so afraid in my entire life and I never knew it is possible to be this afraid. I felt despair, my legs buckled under me, I collapse on the ground, right shoulder hitting the ground as I lay there crying, tears streaming down my cheek. From the corner of my eyes, I saw Lavinia is also on the ground, involuntarily jerking, foam forming in the corner of her mouth, tears streaming down her cheek. Toby just stood there in silence, not a peep came out of his mouth. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe low bellowing returned once more, the creature and portal vanished without a trace, leaving the three of us in the woods all by ourselves. \\n\\n“Look, I know you wouldn’t believe us, but it is true! It happened!!! IT TOOK OUR FRIEND FOR GOD SAKE!!!!” I started yelling at Rick, the park ranger. The hopelessness in me disappeared for a moment, as I tried to warn Rick of the horror that we experienced up in the woods. \\n\\n“Okay, okay, please calm down, Mel.” Rick tried to calm me, seeing that I am about to lose control. Lavinia was waiting in the car, refusing to leave the small, confined safe space of the vehicle. She hasn’t stopped mumbling ever since the whole ordeal. Toby is in the office toilet, probably vomiting again. It must have been like the fifth time he is doing that since we barely escaped with our lives. I am surprised there is still anything left in him to hurl. \\n\\n“Mel, you have to know how crazy your story sounds! I mean, come on, a surreal forest along the hiking trail that transformed into some horrid nightmare?” Rick explained. I kept quiet, knowing full well how crazy our experience sounded, I wouldn’t believe myself either. But it is true, our friend is gone, and no one can tell me what we witness was just our minds playing tricks on us. No human mind could conceive of such otherworldly things. Even trying to recall some of the details of the weird plants and things we saw earlier makes me head hurt, and I already left out so many details that I just couldn’t explain or put into words. I did not mention our encounter with the abomination during my account of the story. \\n\\n“Regardless, I am not… we are not lying, Rick.” I was massaging my forehead, explaining the situation to Rick. I felt like I could faint and so I closed my eyes. \\n\\n“I don’t think you are lying Mel, I have known you for what, 5? 6 years now? I know that you are a good kid. But nevertheless, I need to ask, you know, just as formality. Did any of you guys took anything today? Any kind of drugs, prescription or otherwise.” He asked, jotting something down on his notepad. \\n\\nI saw this question coming from miles away, in fact, I asked myself repeatedly on the way down here to the ranger station. I look him in the eye and said “No, we didn’t. We are not really into recreational drugs. We were just planning to hike and have a simple barbeque, a nice get together. My friend in the toilet, Toby, was going to propose to his girlfriend tonight, you know. To the girl who is now dead. Whose body can never be found now. You can search us or the car if you want.” I looked him squarely in the eye to show that I am not lying, tears once again streaming down my eyes at the mention of Mimi. \\n\\n“I am really sorry to hear that.” He looks right back at me, concern and sympathy in his eyes, “There’s no need for that, just a formality you know. Just to put in the report that I did check with you guys. Also, is there any one amongst you that have any history of mental illness? He marked a cross down on his notepad. \\n\\n“Nope. Although I suspect we will need some help after all these craziness…” I said, Rick just kept quiet. I leaned forward, “Was there ever any case of missing person in the forest before?” I asked, wiping the tears away from my eyes \\n\\nRick shook his head, “The forest is really not that big and the trail is pretty easy and straightforward. There are hikers reported missing once in a while, thrill seekers getting off the path to go for a bit of exploring, but never anything like this.” He paused, then put away his notepad in one of his drawers, “We will file a missing person report for your friend and organize a search part for her. I will contact you if we find anything, okay?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“I don’t know if I want you guys up there, but it might give us a clue about what the fuck actually happened.” I got up and started walking towards the door. With my hands on the doorknob, I turned around, looked at Rick and said, “Be careful out there, Rick.”, and I went back to the car, to my girlfriend, and wait for Toby to join us.\\n\\nIt has been 2 days since we got back to our home, Lavinia hasn’t been the same, she stares off into space a lot. We have been crying ourselves to sleep at night, hugging each other to feel each other’s warmth, to remind ourselves that we are still very much alive, in this reality that we know of. We haven’t heard from Toby after I dropped him off at his place. I was worried about him but also thought of giving him some space before calling him to find out how he is doing. \\n\\nLavinia and I haven’t talked about the incidence, I wanted to bring it up during our dinner last night, but I just didn’t know what to say or how to start. How do you bring up a topic like this? Something so surreal and horrid that you doubt your sanity and the reality of it. Did it really happen? How could something so absurd has ever happened to us? We felt as though we were in a horror movie, not even a good one at that, one of those cheesy horror movies filled with clichés, about a bunch of people stumbling upon some unknown interdimensional thing during their trip. The absurdity of it all makes me burst of laughing sometimes. \\n\\nWe haven’t been to work for the past couple of days. Everything just seemed so insignificant after all that we have witnessed. There are things out there that we never knew existed. Impossible things that defy our laws of physics, things that made me feel so small, so worthless and insignificant. I often find myself sitting in a corner, hugging myself, while Lavinia sat on the couch staring off into space and mumbling. I try not to think about the creature in the tunnel but every so often, it would appear in my mind, a stark reminder of the horror that we have been through. I tried my best to distract myself with other thoughts, to watch some tv, to read, to play my favorite video games. Sometimes they help, but more often than not, they don’t. Worse still are my nightmares at night, where its hideous form vividly presented before me, its voice, clear as day, calling my name. I wonder how we are ever going back to a normal life again. \\n\\nThis morning, the third day since our return, around 11am, Toby dropped by. Mimi’s parents have been calling him like crazy for the past few days. He never picked up their calls, not knowing how to explain to them the death of their one and only daughter. He eventually destroyed his phone with a hammer to avoid the feeling of guilt. \\n\\nHe brought with him today’s newspaper. When I told him I hadn’t read it yet, he shoved it in my hands, and asked me to flip to the third page. I complied, and Lavinia, hearing our exchange, walked over and sat next to me on the couch. There it was, occupying the top half of the page, a title that says, “Mysterious disappearance of search party during search and rescue mission”. \\n\\nRick’s name was listed along with his 9 other colleagues as members of the missing search party. I look at up Toby but he gestured for me to continue reading. I turned my head down towards the news piece again and felt goosebumps all over my skin when I read the last paragraph. It simply states:\\n\\n*Authorities also discovered an unknown patch of land filled with undiscovered species of flora and fauna located near the hiking trail, where a girl was reportedly missing. Representative stated that the land seemingly appeared overnight as it has never been seen by anyone since the opening of the hiking trail more than 50 years ago. The area has now been sealed off for further investigation and no further comment regarding the nature of the land was issued by the relevant parties.* \\n\\nToby was no longer in his seat when I look at again. Later, I found him sitting on our bathroom floor with his back against our cabinet, razor blade in his left hand, and multiple cuts on his right forearm, with a huge pool of blood on the floor. He was still conscious when I found him and we locked eyes for a brief moment. I then left the bathroom, closing the door behind me. \\n\\nLavinia returned to her usual state of staring off into space and mumbling while I was heading upstairs. I returned couple of minutes later, with my 9mm in my hand. I walked to Lavinia and gave her a kiss on the forehead, then positioned myself in front of her, noticing once again just how beautiful she really is. Her auburn shoulder length hair that perfectly framed her slightly chubby and rosy cheeks, her long eyelashes, and her supple lips. Her big brown eyes that were once so beautiful and full of spirit now seem dull and hollow. \\n\\nI raised my handgun at her and took aim at her forehead, making sure that she will not suffer. She gradually turned and look at me lovingly with her eyes. “I love you, Mel”, she said before closing her eyes. \\n\\nTears streaming down my eyes as I smiled at her.\\n\\n“I love you, Lavinia.”\\n\\nI pull the trigger.'"

    "### Always try to get data directly from source or use API or RestAPI to retrieve data from backend database first. Only use scraping when there is no other choices as it is very slow, requires a lot of efforts in extracting data from web pages and risk of IP address being blocked by target website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data scraped from Reddit has a lot of duplicated postings and contains advertisments that may be offensive to some (eg, NSFW). Reddit limiting scraping to 1,000 posts for each subreddit plus removing of duplicates, null and offensive adverts post a severe limitation on modeling (insufficient data). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes Multinomial classifer is suitable for this type of task ie, classifying binary outputbut other models with hyperparameters tuning capabilities such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Tf/ Idf can build more accurate models. In this particular case, Logistic Regression's model produces a more accurate results in classifying posts in the respective thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "### Durng the EDA phase, the fact that there are more NSFW in the No Sleep thread than the Truth thread shows that either the Truth thread is actively blocking ads or other companies is getting results from the No Sleep thread. Therefore, placing ads in the No Sleep thread makes more sense and more bang for the buck too. \n",
    "\n",
    "### It will be good if more data can be obtained to do topic modeling to segment No sleep group users by topics. This way, specific advertisements can be targeted to the respective topical group. Business can approach Reddit for posting pop-up advertisements based on the contents posted by the users. For eg, business can place advertisements such as computer games, online games to users posting fantasy related stories. For user group posting horror stories, business can advertise on-demand movies subscription or novel that are horror genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If reddit's system has adaptive capabiliy, business can consider using the feature for eg, analytics can be perfomed and pop-up advertisement promoting products and services that are related to the contents can be activated while the user is still typing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### As for the Truth group, business may want to offer products and services such as councelling service, yoga lessons, supplements with calming effects, etc. to help users that may be trying to get over their traumatic experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To measure how successful the advertisements for each group, Reddit can provide click rate for each group so that business can measure the performance of the advertisements.\n"
