t3_fgho9x,all_ads,I met my daughter from a miscarriage 3 years ago.,Thetruthishere,"On mobile so I apologize for formatting and any errors.

This is a little bit difficult to talk about, as it happened last Thursday night and is still very emotional. A little back story, I have always been in touch with the other side, they use me a lot. Typically, I have no emotional connection with any spirit I come in contact with. This was different.

An important piece of information is that I have a six year old daughter. When I go outside, often times she will be directly on the other side of the front door and asking when I'll be back in.

In the early afternoon, my wife and I had stepped outside for a few minutes. As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered ""yes dear"" just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.

Later that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn't out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.

Whenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say ""momma"" just as a few hours earlier. My wife did not see her nor hear her, but she very clearly heard it the first time.

The age of this child is what mine would have been, had I not miscarried. The father is blonde with golden eyes. She had my curls and his chubby cheeks. I could just feel that she was my baby. She came to me because I needed something to keep me going.

Tl;dr : I met the ghost of my miscarried daughter in a time of need, and boy, was she beautiful."
t3_fglpap,all_ads,December Reddit Post About Wuhan Virus Dream,Thetruthishere,"I wish to god that I'd screengrabbed it at the time, but does anyone else remember this post?

It was in late December (I think) and it was either here, or r/glitchinthematrix, r/glitch_in_the_matrix, r/paranormal, r/highstrangeness or possibly one of the conspiracy subs. Wish I'd paid more attention. Crossposting to some other subs to see if anyone else remembers.

The post: OP had a dream about a virus coming in 2020, comparable in scope and impact to the 1918 Spanish Flu. In their dream, it began in a place called Wuhan. When they woke, they googled ""Wuhan"" and saw that there's the virus lab there and that spooked them.

I've searched all over for the post since but there's no sign of it. Asked Twitter for help but nobody could find any trace. Not sure if it was a genuine premonition or some coded form of whistleblowing. It's stuck in my head since, and become steadily more relevant for obvious reasons.

Anyone else remember?"
t3_fgmudo,all_ads,It followed.,Thetruthishere,"When I was younger me and my friends enjoyed exploring abandoned houses. We had been to many, in and around our town. There was a specific house that we went back to many times to explore. It was a big building, split into two sides and very old, probably from the 18th century. It had a basement, 10 bedrooms and an attic (that we never managed to get into). 

I first discovered it when me and one other friend saw it from a field nearby my house. We had a look round and were pretty creeped out to say the least. There was a stairwell that lead to an underground room underneath the house that you could get to from outside. We went in and all the lights were on...we soon left after discovering this.

A few weeks later we were out with a group of our mates. There was probably 7 or 8 of us. We got the idea of returning to the house and so we did. We managed to get in this time, and we had a look round. All the lights worked and were connected to electricity, which confused me but we continued to look round. There was a large basement with furnaces and oven etc. All the rooms were pretty similar and we soon left as there wasn’t an awful amount to do.

Anyway, to the point. Recently me and two other friends decided to go back to the house. We were bored and figured it would be fun. It was around 8pm when we left so it was pitch black. The house backed onto a field so we chose to get to it from there. It was about a 15 minute walk from my house so it didn’t take us long. We entered the field and began trudging towards the house. 

We were slightly nervous, but we had done this before so it was nothing to be scared about. We slowly approached the back of the house, observing the windows (there were 5). It was very dark, but we did have a powerful torch so we had no trouble seeing. There was a fence surrounding the back of the house so in order to get in we would have to climb over this. My friend volunteered to go first and as he began climbing we heard the most terrifying sound. The word ‘meow’ came from inside of the house. We all froze. This was not a cat. Someone had mimicked the noise of a cat from inside of that house. For a split second we did nothing, and then we ran.

As we ran, a horrifying, cackling laugh came bellowing out of the house. We said nothing to each other we just sprinted towards the exit of the field. I was petrified and I was playing the noise over and over in my head, grimacing at who or what it could have been. When we got to the road we stopped running to catch our breath. We tried to discuss what had happened but none of us had answers, it was truly terrifying. We slowly calmed down as we walked towards my house and figured maybe it was somebody messing around. But that’s not the end of the story.

My house is very near to a mere which has a footpath that goes all the way around it. You can get to the town from my house by walking through the mere. On our way back we decided we wanted to go to town, still talking about what had happened and honestly still not really believing it actually had. We decided to cut through the mere to get to town as it was the quickest way, so we did. It was about 9pm by this point and any light was totally gone. I still had my touch, but we encountered a couple of walkers at the mere so I decided to turn it off so I wouldn’t blind anyone walking towards us. We walked and spoke as we entered the mere and it takes about 10 minutes to get round to the entrance to the town. It was very quiet, apart from our chatter there was no sound at all. Suddenly out of the bushes next to us came the same sound ‘meow’. It felt as if it was within a metre of us. This time we did not freeze. We ran so fucking fast away from that noise. The same cackling laugh came from the bushes as we ran, and I kid you not, it ran after us. Only for a short while, but it followed us as we sprinted away. 

To this day, I don’t know who or what that noise came from. But it followed us back from that house. Thinking about someone watching us and following us all the way back and knowing where i live. It scared the hell out of me. It’s safe to say, I never went back to the house."

t3_fg4wjo,all_ads,My Grandmother’s Story,Thetruthishere,"When my grandma was in her 20s, she was the sole survivor of a small plane crash. Her husband and two friends they were with died, and the only reason she survived is because her husband wrapped his body around hers to protect her from the impact.

After the plane crash, she was in the hospital in a coma for 3 weeks. During that coma, she saw a light at the end of a tunnel. She wanted to go towards the light but a figure appeared at the end. The figure said “You can’t go, you have to stay. You’re not done here yet.” She told the figure she wanted to go and it insisted she had to stay. She has hinted that this figure may have been her husband.

She recovered fully from the coma and went on to remarry, have her three beautiful daughters, then remarry again to my grandpa (she is technically my step grandmother). My grandpa, her third husband, is a pilot. Until they married, she had not been in a plane since the crash and never planned on getting in a plane again, yet she now (miraculously) flies comfortably with my grandpa. She believes 
 that the reason she could not go when she wanted to was because she hadn’t yet had her daughters. She is in her 70s now, and for the first time in her life, after years of therapy, she can tell this story without visibly getting upset. She is an incredibly strong, caring woman and I believe her story with my whole heart, as does she."
t3_fgho8c,all_ads,Something is desperately trying to reach my mom,Thetruthishere,"So I have a long story with lot of moving parts, so bear with me. I think I will tell this story in the order events as I found out about them, rather than how they chronologically occurred.

To begin, I have this recurring dream that I've been having since middle school. I have it one or two times a year, but it's slowed down since I've gotten older. In the dream I'm at home, but it isn't my house. It's a big 2 or 3 story home that's shaped like a U. I've never seen anything like it before. I go upstairs to my mom's room in this dream and she's on the bed, seizing. My first thought is that she must be possessed. I call my brother in a panic and tell him mom is possessed. He just asks me if we need more bread or milk, because he's grocery shopping. We fight back and forth, he refuses to listen, and I eventually hang up and try to help my mom myself. Before I can do anything she stops seizing and looks out the window. I run to the window that overlooks the pool (in the middle of the U). I see a spirit flying into (out of?) the pool. I don't hear anything but I know his name is Chris. My mom is fine again.

It's a weird dream to keep having, but I've never thought too much of it. 

Moving forward to when I was in college. There was a Ouija board that had been on the game shelf of my house for as long as I can remember. None of us have ever touched it or played it, but it has always been there. I asked if I could take it with me to college. I thought it would be fun for my friends and I to use. I've been very interested in paranormal, but never really believed in it. I take it, and the first time I use it, I ask if it knows me. It says yes. I ask how. It spells MAMA. I disregard it, my friends I use it several times after that. Nothing particularly interesting really happens in the hundreds of other uses.

One night, a few years later, my family is all sitting in a hot tub late at night in late fall in our backyard. We were just looking at the stars but my little brother suggested we tell ghost stories. No one could come up with any, so we started talking about weird dreams and the meanings behind them instead. I offered to share mine, as I recently had one that I had several times before.

I tell this dream to my family and my mom and dad turn their necks so quickly to look at each other I swear I hear them crack. I ask them what's wrong and they say Chris is just someone from their past. They act awfully strange for a bit before my mom says that she does, actually, have a ghost story.

When my parents were teenagers and still dating my mom bought a Ouija board (the same one I took with me to college). She convinced my dad to use it with her and the had fun asking it questions about their future and what not. They ask several questions about their future and specifically, it if they'll ever have their own cars. It answers ""Grand Prix."" They asked for the name of the ghost their speaking to and it said *Christopher.* They didn't really play with it again due to just lack of interest.

Several months (maybe years?) after their first experience, my mom buys her first car. Lo and behold, it's a Grand Prix. I think the fact that the Ouija board predicted that was a realization they had several months after the purchase. Could be chocked up to subconscious, but a little weird.

**I will refer to my mom as ""M"" from here on**

Several months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They're there for a Superbowl party, I think. They're out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said ""M's GP"".

She gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They're loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.

""Is your name M?""

""Yeah, it's my Grand Prix, why?""

""My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying ""where M, where M?""

She did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.

Now, to top things off, I'm working at my first job after college. I've been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U. It is nearly identical to the one from my dream, save for the fact there's a courtyard instead of a pool in the center.

 I'd love to hear any thoughts. It definitely feels like someone is looking for my mom, and now going through me to find her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's worth noting but my mom also seems to have a sort of sixth sense? She has dreams about people in strange rooms before they die, she's ran into someone in the grocery store and thought  ""he doesn't seem well"" weeks before he is diagnosed with cancer (and was outwardly 100% fine and normal), and she has told me that a few times as a child she has been so angry with someone (bullying her brother), she can't stop thinking about how much she hates them, and they've died shortly after."
t3_fgutdx,all_ads,teleported to a subway train made out of shadows,Thetruthishere,"hey, so this happened to me when i was 15 when i was just hanging out on my couch doing nothing in particular. im not a good writer by any means but ill try and explain this as coherently as i can

so, like i said, i was 15 and just sitting on my couch for a reason i cant remember (i know i wasnt watching tv), i remember the couch was facing towards the front window during that time, that no one else was home, and that it was afternoon. i remember suddenly feeling really tired, and started slouching over like i was about to fall asleep, my vision became dark and all i could see were black silhouettes of people in a dark subway train.. nothing really went on, though.. i was just there for about 2 minutes, and then i got up as if nothing had happened. i never had any similar experiences after that although i do suffer from occasional sleep paralysis and psychosis (although im not schizophrenic)

i apologize for my shitty writing, i hope that was at least intelligible lmao. but yeah, i have no idea what any of that was about (my best guess is that it was some medical issue) and id appreciate some input or to at least know if anyones had any similar experiences. thanks for reading!"
t3_fgj6qz,all_ads,It watches me...,Thetruthishere,"So, I posted this in r/paranormal but have had no response. I am a scientist and a skeptic by nature, but I’m curious as to this may be: 
https://www.reddit.com/user/Blighty2020/comments/f9xb7n/i_have_seen_this_creature_twice_does_anyone_know/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

This is a sketch of something I have seen on two occasions in the last few years. In the first instance, it was standing in my bedroom doorway, staring at me whilst I was in bed. It was very tall, had yellow glaring eyes, and a black ethereal smoke rising from it as pictured. I have obviously considered sleep paralysis, but I was physically being pulled from my bed and the covers were pulled off onto the floor.

The second time was a few months ago. I was making my way to bed (now a cabin bed positioned near the ceiling) and found it in the same place. My cat looked scared and climbed up the bed ASAP, followed by myself scurrying up the ladder. Peeking through the bed slats I saw it standing tall, feet obstructed with that heavy air of intimidation permeating from it. I don’t remember nightmares that clearly, especially to the point that I can remember something clear enough to draw it down in every detail. 

I disclose that I do get PTSD nightmares, which are very different and event-specific. I also have BPD, Clinical Depression, and Autism (most of which I’ve had for almost 20 years), though none of them involved illusions of a schizophrenic nature. I am wondering whether it is psychological, but it seemed so real. Maybe the sign of sone impending fate or total lack of sanity?

I’m interested. Let me know your thoughts and theories."
t3_fghmzo,all_ads,the alien,Thetruthishere,"I was about 5/6 I'm going to guess that it was around 3 am when this happened anyway so I woke up and I started walking around my house I got to my mom and dad's room and knocked on there door. no answer so I walk to my brother's room and try waking him up he does not wake up.  I pass the bathroom and head to go sleep with my sister she was spending the night with us that night and she was sleeping on an air mattress the mattress was facing the bathroom as I was heading to where she was sleeping once I got there I sat down on the bed and turn my head to the bathroom and I see an alien he was a bright green with big black eye I lay down and just stare at it for a bit then I pass out.

t3_fgje5f,all_ads,Weird House,Thetruthishere,"About a week ago me and some friends were in a small old town. Old as in 100s of years old, these houses are at least a century old. Ghost town as you might put it. The town has about 2 streets. 

Me and a friend walk up to this house. This house was an old two story house with the small creepy windows at the top. It had a half wrapped around porch like the centennial houses back in the days. It has a wheel chair lift (which was up) onto their porch. 

The porch is completely fenced off so you can only stand on the steps. We notice that all of the windows and doors are blocked off. Like they have so much crap on their porch that there is no way into the house from the porch. Which was odd. Why would the wheelchair life be up if there’s no way into the house? We reasoned that either there’s still a person in a wheelchair inside or that someone put it up so people wouldn’t use it. There was also two cars in the driveway.

Anyways, we got back into the car, and I could feel someone watching me. I also got this strong wave of sadness. I knew something was off, and I didn’t feel like myself anymore. I felt so sad all of a sudden. My brain and thought process was turned to mush.

We stayed in this town for about 30 more minutes. I really wanted to get out of this town. I felt like something was really off. 

I noticed this guy. There was this guy sitting in his car on the side of the road. He had his phone out and it looked like he was video taping us. I think he noticed that we were watching him because he drove away. This could explain some of this lol. 

As we passed that house to get out of town, the sadness went away in a wave. I was completely back to normal."

t3_fgj5zt,all_ads,Shared dream of a possible death in a motel,Thetruthishere,"Excuse my writing, I’m not the best writer but i think this is a relatively interesting story and maybe someone could help me figure out what happened there. Anyway, when  I was in high school (2014ish) my parents, one of my friends, and I went on a trip to New Mexico from Kentucky. My parents took turns driving the whole way so we stayed at a couple of hotels on the way there and back. While on the way back home, we stayed at a motel (I don’t remember where). The motel looked normal, but I felt kind of uneasy there. Night time came and I wake up in the middle of the night to a growl. I look around and I feel like there is someone else in the room with us. I get pretty uneasy in the dark anyway, so I figure it’s just me being weird and shut my eyes and try to focus on sleeping. I eventually fall back asleep, only to have a really weird dream. In my dream dream, it’s daylight and I’m a male walking into the hotel. As I’m walking in a group of guys attack me and kill me. It was a very real feeling dream. The next day, my mom and my friend have both had dreams about a man in the hotel and similar feelings of uneasiness."
t3_fgf0yl,all_ads,My Guardian Angel? Has anyone else experienced this,Thetruthishere,"This happened a year ago for context.
I had a dream I was in HS again in a place mixed with my birth place, where I was raised and, my future town I’m guessing. My mom comes to pick me up and, as we’re driving on the highway we go on a ramp. But, I notice before my mom does that it’s not done and, literally drops off. As I go to tell my mom she notices too but, at that point it was too late so, we start saying our I love yous, holding hands and our goodbyes. Surprisingly, the fall is slow and as we’re dropping in what feels like slow motion, we see all the lights of the cars on the other levels like a light show. This makes us laugh and we stay holding hands finally the car lands w a little jolt but we’re in one piece. As I go to express my surprise to my mom I feel my eyes droop and my neck just falls to the side. I woke up from it relatively calm but as I wake I realized there was smt at the foot of my bed. Couldn’t see a face or anything just a tall figure looking at me w his head tilted. For a sec I thought a man was watching me bc I could make out a white shirt and his figure was def not female. But all while I was running thru these things in my mind, unbeknownst to me I was screaming non stop so much so that my mom rushed to my room. As soon as my mom touched me he literally whisped away like smoke or sand in the wind. This all happened at 6 am btw so no devil hour and such. 
That day I later took a nap and, as I was napping I felt this intense bright light behind my eyes and, could not move or open my eyes. So, I just started praying to god to let me out of it and, as I said it I felt the light shutter away and I could open my eyes. Needless to say, I slept w in my parents room w my mom that night. I woke up at 6 again and, at the foot of my bed is the same figure but he’s not curious anymore just watching. I began screaming unknowingly again and, as soon as my mom touched me he whisped away again. 
That morning I told my mom adamant about what I saw. She then called my aunt (who is b spiritual and connected) and asked, she told my mom that was my guardian angel trying to warn me about a threat to/in my life. She said I’m lucky if I can see him and not many can say they have. 
So, the next night before I went to bed I prayed to god to never show me him again because, whatever threat was possibly in my life I think the Angel he sent would take me sooner than that w a heart attack. I also asked to send a handsome one and, not a terrifying one. I feel bad that I shut him out but, I can’t keep screaming awake. 

A lot of people I’ve read say that they hear their guardian angel or angel speak to them but, I haven’t read or heard of them seeing them fully. 
 
Please share your experience if it’s similar to mine! I’m still so confused."
t3_fg9fzn,all_ads,Sobbing in the Forest,Thetruthishere,"Tonight I had a strange experience out in the woods on the perimeter of my university campus and I'd love to have some second opinions on what could've been happening. At around 8:30 pm, my friends (2 others) and I decided to ditch our responsibilities for a while and go out on a walk around campus. We eventually found ourselves at the edge of the campus, where the forest begins. Collectively we all just shrugged and decided, why not take a walk in the forest?

The forest itself is really, really large, spanning several hundred acres, and we had walked pretty far once it started to rain more than we would've liked. My friends and I had all packed umbrellas, so we opened them up and decided to turn around and make the trip back to campus. On our way back, at about halfway out,  we heard a loud sobbing sound coming from several metres behind us. To me, it sounded like a woman drawing out her sobbing for a few seconds and then stopping. The sound wasn't coming from behind us on the dirt path we were walking on, rather from several metres behind us within the forest.

My friends and I had been walking with a phone flashlight pointed to the ground ahead of us, and upon hearing the crying sound, we sped up and walked faster to get **OUT OF THERE**. There would be a period of silence, then the sound would repeat, with each repeat coming up closer next to us (to our left, still within the forest). Each repeat of the sobbing sounded less distinctly like a person crying and more animal-like, which was concerning because it was seemingly following us. It also sounded like there were two sounds happening, one after the other, but ending at the same time. The sound repeated maybe 2 or 3 times, with the last call/cry we heard was about matched to where we were,  still metres away in the forest (parallel, not right directly beside us). I was on the leftmost side of the path and I kept my eyes on the woods the whole time as we sped walked OUT of there, but I wasn't able to see anything moving or trace where/what the sound was coming from.

Once we were out of the forest and far enough away that we were properly back on campus, I pulled out my phone to look up fox/coyote calls on youtube to see if anything sounded similar, but every clip I listened to sounded too dog-like. I'd say that the closest might've been some fox soundbites, but they sounded too high pitched and more like wailing than sobbing. I can't imagine that any animal would've wanted to tail us considering we were three people who were talking/laughing fairly loudly, with umbrellas open, and a bright light trained on the ground ahead of us. My friends shrugged the experience off and tried to rationalize it by saying that it was likely dogs out in the woods, but I know what we heard and I know that it definitely was not anyone's dog. No one would've been walking in the forest in the rain at 9 pm on a Monday (other than us crazies), so I really don't know what it could've been. I really wish I had taken my phone out earlier and recorded the noise as it was happening, but I'm not sure if I'd ever want to relive that again."

t3_ffutdm,all_ads,What did she see?,Thetruthishere,"It was evening About a year and a half ago.  My youngest daughter, who was 3 at the time, suddenly let out a horrified scream from the living room, followed by an episode of scared crying. I was getting my other daughter dried off after her bath and ran out to see what happened. 

I found her running towards me from the other side of one of the chairs in the living room. I said “what happened?!” She was sobbing and grabbing onto me so I picked her up and said “what’s wrong?” 
She wouldn’t tell me so I just let her cry until she calmed down. We went to the room she snd her sister shared, and finally she told me she saw a face under the chair. 

I need to mention, I didn’t watch anything scary while the kids were around, nor did I allow them to watch anything considered scary. They were always with me unless they were at daycare and I was at work. 

I asked her what the face looked like. She furrowed her brow, grit and bared her teeth and twisted her nose up. The contortion she performed startled me. She had not made that face before. I said “ok, well, I’m going to go check and I promise you, I’ll take care of it, whatever I find.” 

I felt on edge but checked under all the chairs expecting for something to appear to me. I found nothing. I ended up calling my parents, who are religious, and the prayed for us. I did that to comfort the kids, but I believe my daughter must have seen something. 

Earlier that evening, BEFORE I went to pick up my kids from daycare, I got off early from work and went home to watch tv for a bit before going. I ended up watching ghost/paranormal videos. I shut it off before I left to get them. 

Is it possible for things to transfer to your home from videos?  Or something like that? I believe kids are extra sensitive about things like this."
t3_ffxzsu,all_ads,Adamant landlord,Thetruthishere,"This takes place in Grand Rapids, Mi. 

About 18 years ago when I was 17-18 I was living across the state from Grand Rapids. I was a senior in high school and I had a lot of friends who had graduated and went to college. One weekend a friend and I decided to take a trip to see some of our friends and spend the weekend at their house. When we got there we realized the house was down a weird dead end street. It was like a normal city neighborhood but you could turn down this one almost not noticeable street that looked almost like an alley and there was like 5-10 houses down it and they were all in pretty bad shape. 

When we got there it was a really big and old like 5 bedroom house and there was a couple people living there and a couple people I was just meeting for the first time. We met and all got along and were having a good time. Then they started telling me about how weird the street was and how all the neighbors have been living there for a long time. So we started partying and my friend started telling me he loved living in the house but things were weird because he was a really curious dude and he said the landlord told them specifically when they moved in he knew they were gonna be partying a lot and just doing typical young college kid stuff. Then he starts telling me about the basement. 

He tells me after the landlord told him he didn’t care what they did the one rule he had in the house, and he was very adamant about this, was to never under any circumstances try not to open the doors in the basement. Obviously at this point my interest is piqued. So after a discussion we head down to the basement. 

To set this up visually... the basement was like one of those very old basements where everything is cement. It was super dirty and long and had big cement support pillars down the middle and there was nothing in it. Now on either side of the room there was doors. Big doors. And when I saw them my heart sank. 

Both doors had about 1000 nails in them. All over. Some of them were bent, some were sticking out. It looked like someone was frantically nailing this thing as shut as they could. Both of them. We discussed it for awhile and decided not to open the doors and honestly I really regret it. I still think about it from time to time. I have no idea what was behind them. We’ve discussed so many possibilities. Was it like an old well? But if so why would they be on both sides of the house? Was it maybe old tunnels? The house was really old. My the ultimate reason my friend didn’t want us opening the doors is because he was afraid a poltergeist was trapped or something, which I laughed off. 

I don’t even think the house is still there but I know they asked the landlord again what was behind the doors and all he would say is “just promise me you’ll never try and open them”"
t3_ffmb4q,all_ads,Barefoot cemetery girl,Thetruthishere,"A couple months ago me and my buddy were drinking at our friends house and we both decided we wanted to leave. Of course being the responsible guys we are we agreed to walk to my house and I would drive him to pick up his car in the morning. It was about 3am and pretty cold. I only had a sweatshirt on and was shivering a little bit.

At one point in the walk a cemetery was up about a quarter mile to the right. I looked up and saw a little girl with black hair running into the cemetery and immediately I told my friend to look but he looked too late and didn’t see her as she disappeared into the cemetery. I explained to him what I saw and obviously he thought I was crazy and just seeing things and wrote it off as I had a little too much to drink. 

Fast forward about 5 minutes later and we’re walking on the left side of the road with the cemetery to our right immediately next to the road. 

We’re just walking and talking but I couldn’t stop thinking about the little girl I saw running. She had no coat or sweatshirt and it was cold out. Just as I was about to stop thinking about it she pops out from a bush right next to the cemetery on the other side of the road. She popped out of the bush and sprinted down the road, I froze with fear and my friend immediately started laughing. I asked him why the fuck are you laughing and he said because I can’t believe my eyes right now. She kept running, pretty fast I may add and just like that she was gone. She didn’t disappear like a gosht or anything she just was too far away to see anymore maybe she hid in another bush i’m not sure. With that closer look we both had I noticed she had a long sleeve grey t-shirt on and jeans. The strange thing is that she was also barefoot. It was way too cold to be running around with no coat or sweatshirt and barefoot. We called our friends back at the house we were at and none of them believed us. To this day I am sure she was real and it was overall the most creepy experience I’ve ever had."
t3_ffw3sv,all_ads,I think I have been cursed,Thetruthishere,"I have an acquaintance, who i not longer associate with.  She was into dark majik, and always said that she sent servators, and paid a witch to curse those who displeased her.  I let her know that i disagreed with some of her actions and she ended the friendship.  However since then I have had horrible financial and  employment luck , and physical health issues.  How can i tell if she has attempted to curse me? How can I remove it if she has?"
t3_ffrqgq,all_ads,Special baby,Thetruthishere,"A little background first. I am a sensitive and have seen ghosts, spirits, demons, unknown things. I currently have a 10 month old daughter. She’s been walking last few weeks pretty well and sooner than other babies around us. Her crib is still in our bedroom next to my side of the bed. It’s a proper crib with the mattress lowered so she can’t fall out and can stand up. There is a night light at the foot of her crib that is always on. 

It’s the middle of the night. We are all asleep. I wake up to something brush my face lightly..Felt like maybe air? Anyways, I open my eyes a little confused why I’m awake. I lightly hear my baby whispering and light laughing. I open my eyes and look around. I see her walking next to bed! Wobbly holding on the side of the bed and crib to balance. (She hasn’t had to hold on for a few weeks) I’m scared thinking she must have fallen out of her crib somehow and is hurt? Then I think maybe I slept in? And husband took her out and let her wake me? I’m starting to sit up and she starts walking back towards my way. Closer to the head of the crib. She keeps looking inside the crib excited and lightly laughing/whispering. I hear husband snoring behind me and realize somethings wrong. I sit up a little and get ready to pick her up to check her. Make sure she’s not hurt. However she’s escaped. That’s when i noticed! I could see her sleeping inside the crib!! I sit up all the way and throw my blanket off..the baby is now with its back to me at the head of the crib, I yell WTF?! It turns. Looks at me and walks into the wall. It had no face. Just a blur. Now I’m mad. And yell wtf again. Check my daughter. She’s fine. Sleeping. I get up bless the whole room with holy water. And go back to bed. Sleeping peacefully now I’m woken up again. Now there’s a light laugh and noise back again. By the foot of the crib again. I don’t see anything just feel it. I had enough of this shit. I got up, picked up my daughter n put her to sleep in the middle of us. Whatever that no face giggling thing was. I was Over it! Unless you have some lotto numbers don’t keep waking me up with no face. 

After speaking to a few elders. I was told it was just a friendly spirit nothing evil. That’s why it was allowed to enter even after being blessed. It just wanted to play and changed it’s form. That’s why it had no face. My daughter has been showing signs of being sensitive as well. Which I’ll save for another day.

Anyone else have any more insight on this feel free to leave a comment."
t3_ffptwy,all_ads,Sister thinks she's targeted by a spirit; need advice,Thetruthishere,"My little sister is 12 (almost 13) and just called me to tell me she thinks she has a spirit attached to her. I asked why she felt that way, and she says everything feels ""different."" She won't really elaborate beyond that, but she says she doesn't feel scared and doesn't know if it's good or bad.

I don't believe in spirits and am inclined to believe she's feeling ""different"" for other reasons; however, I want her to feel heard and cared for, so she's coming over next weekend and we're going to chat about this. I know burning sage can ward off some spirits, but does anyone know of anything else I can do to make her feel safe and cleansed? I will also be gently trying to find out any other info I can as to why she feels this way. 

I advised her to not attempt contact with it. I don't think it's good for her whether this is real or not."
t3_ffe97l,all_ads,There's something protecting and there's something out to get me,Thetruthishere,"Some time ago I posted here about an entity that I Felt throughout my whole life, that used to be hostile, but is now becoming more friendly.

Well, some time after that I felt it getting closer to me, as if trying to understand me. I felt it getting more and more comfortable in my room. And the more comfortable it got, so did I.

This got to the point where I actually feel better when I can sense its presence. Yesterday when I went to sleep I actually felt it looking at me. Studying me again. I felt safe. And even though I slept for only about 4 hours I woke up feeling better than I normally do with 7+ hours of sleep.

But sometimes I feel something else. Something hostile, quick, and incredibly angry. I feel scared, and I think it also scares whatever is in my room. I've felt that presence sometimes around my home, and sometimes inside, but never in my room.

Other than that, I keep thinking about everything that tried to get in but couldn't because of whatever is watching me.

Any advice on how to proceed? How do I get whatever wants to harm me out of here? What might be the entity that I feel so much?

Even now, typing these words I feel it watching me from afar. It's shy, and whenever I'm home it hesitates to get out of the bedroom."
t3_ffqdnl,all_ads,The Girl in the white dress,Thetruthishere,"Ok so long time lurker, first time poster. When i was a kid, maybe about 9 or 10, I was outside walking my dog Harley (hard headed, fearless beagle). I distinctly remember it being cold as hell, which is important. Well as im walking him, i hear leaves rustle off to the left of me. I look up, and nothing is there. It was about this time that Harley starts getting his hackles up and growling, but his tail is between his legs. I had seen this dog stare down a 120 pound aggressive german shepherd and never once tuck his tail, so this made me nervous. I follow where hes staring and theres this girl standing by a truck, staring at me. Shes wearing a torn up, white, sleeveless, knee length dress. No eyes, just black pits. Matted hair. And pale. So fucking pale. My immediate reaction to this was that deep seated, primal, gtfo fear, but also sadness, so i asked if she needed help. When i asked, she took off behind the truck. I ran after but she was gone. Just gone. Thats not the strangest part though. Ive seen her once every three years since then. The first time i saw her was in Mississippi and i live in Louisiana now. Always the same girl, always about 30 feet away, always at night. Has anybody else had an experience similar to this?"

t3_ffk5cl,all_ads,What is it with doorways? The only ghosts or entities I've ever seen stand in doorways.,Thetruthishere,"I've seen 3 ghosts or entities in my life. All three have been standing in a door way! Has any one experienced the same? The first, at my old house, I was woken from a dead sleep and I saw a tall man in a dark suit and a black top hat (1800s or earlier era!)... The second, a few months later, same thing woke up from a dead sleep and in the same doorway I saw someone holding a sign with numbers written across, for the life of me cant remember the numbers. 

In the new house I live in, I woke up to use the washroom in the middle of the night. The toilet faces the door and a tall, dark figure - woman, appeared there for a moment in my half asleep state.

Why all doorways? Anyone else experience ghosts in a doorway?"
t3_ff46lm,all_ads,Three Kings Ritual Gone Wrong,Thetruthishere,"I've had a couple of supernatural / paranormal experiences in my life but there is one that stands out from them all. When I was about 28 I was living in an apartment with a friend of mine. Things were great between us we got along so well and worked well as flatmates. One night we were pretty bored so we decided to go onto the Three Kings subreddit (r/threekings) and try to do a ritual. She was very much into the idea of it but I wasn't because she had no experience with magic or meditation or hypnotism or anything outside of the norm. So I can't remember which ritual it was but I'll describe it as best I can. So I had to hypnotise her which involved reading out a prewritten script, pretty much saying you are getting sleepy, very relaxed, even 10 times more relaxed etc. The thing is I actually hypnotised her. She fell into the hypnosis like instantly. Next there was the ritual part which involved meeting something hidden behind a door that will show her the future. So I was reading out another prewritten script of her walking down a hall looking at different doors, opening the doors and seeing whats on the other side. She described what was on the side doors as nothing, or white light. When she finally got to the door at the end of the hall she was very hesitant to open it. She opened the door and her face changed. A huge grimace came over her face, like a huge smile showing all of her teeth. Straight away I felt light something was wrong and I told her to come out of the hypnosis. But she didn't. She started speaking gibberish that I didnt understand and then finally she said ""He's here, he's here"" Over and over. And now this is where the next thing happens. The lamp next to her flickered a couple of times. It wasn't that intense but it totally freaked me out. I tried to talk to her slowly to wake up again, but she just sat there with her head down whispering gibberish. Suddenly she raised her head and looked at me with her own eyes again. ""What happened?"" She said. We talked into the night but.. she seemed different. Over the next few weeks she changed. She seemed quiet and distant, and got angry a couple of times which wasn't like her. Gradually she started to get better but she wasn't exactly the same again. I recommend staying away from Three Kings rituals unless you know what you're doing."

t3_ffaw0k,all_ads,"GUYS, I JUST SAW MY DEAD DOG",Thetruthishere,"This happened literally MINUTES AGO and I’ll describe what happened. For context, I have two accounts I use, this one and (u/Baxteriscute). My account was banned from r/paranormal, due to the fact that they have terrible mods on it, who gave no warnings to anyone when they get banned. I had to use one, just to write my paranormal stories. 

Anyway, My dog, Baxter, recently passed away from stomach cancer in November, literally days from when he was diagnosed. He was a beautiful soft coated wheaten, and overall was a beautiful dog. He was quiet, he absolutely adored my mom, and he was generally, one of the best dogs to ever live, statistically speaking. 

When he passed, I would see him in a couple of my dreams (posted on this account) and I think he was just trying to say Hi. 

Story: Right now, it’s 3:32am, so I was just going downstairs to get some water, and when I turn the corner, I see him. It was a black shadow, almost physical, like an outline quite distinguished. He was sitting on the stairs, looking down at the kitchen. It took a moment, maybe 3 seconds before I turn on the hallway light, so I could see him for maybe 3-4 seconds. 
I ran downstairs to get a glass of water before scrambling up the steps. 

I have not had an experience like this in a while. At first it was my cat (who died in April) and now it’s my dog. CRAAAZZZY.

t3_ffax9t,all_ads,My two encounters with shadow people,Thetruthishere,"First I'd like to say I'm glad I found this sub because I never get to talk about this experiences, I'm 25, way past the age when you make up ghost stories, but there's no way of telling this kind of stuff without it looking that you are just lying, I can't even believe myself when talking about this.

I used to suffer from sleep paralysis a lot, it has always been terrifying, but there's just two instances where what happened was just completely out of normal.

The first time I was like 15 maybe, I was going through a face where I was starting to believe in God and was learning about him and reading the Bible. Sleep paralysis usually happens in the middle of the night, but this time it happened early in the morning, It was like my head was draged to the curtains by itself, and I could clearly see two red eyes, when I had sleep paralysis you could hear anything in particular, maybe a resemblance of shouts but nothing clear, this time was different. With a really unsettling voice the eyes were telling me to ""do it"", they told me do it over and over and over, I couldn't snap out of it for a really long time, I couldn't even talk back to it inside my mind or anything.

When it was over I was really sceptical about what had happened, part of me didn't believed it was real, and the other part trying to make sense out of it couldn't understand what was ""it"", I had no idea what this thing wanted me to do. I kept it for myself for a time, but later told my grandma, and asked her what she thought this thing wanted me to do, she advised me to not even try to learn what it wanted and just pray.

I had thought maybe I was a bit biased since I was reading the Bible for the first time, and maybe my mind made a demon for me, but the truth is, the devil is not very ""demonic"" in the Bible, yes he is mean beyond normal standards but he is never described in any way and when you read what he says he just sounds like a regular man making people or god question themselves, and the red eyes didn't mention anything about religion and I didn't took it that way, still maybe it had something to do with it if it was real.

The second time I saw them was 10 times more terrifying.
 I was working for a friend looking after her country house while her family was away, Iwas having a really hard time. The place was just enormous and had no way of stoping people form jumping the small grids, some places you could stick through without even jumping, and her family was rather wealthy, having a lot of valuables inside the house.

From the house to the nearest entrance must have been like a km, and there I learned woods are not like in the movies, take 5 steps away from the light the house gives you and it's pitch black, you won't see 1 meter in front of you and it was as if flash lights got their light sucked out of them, using them would only give you 3 more meters in one direction.

I was on the process of buying a gun when my friend forbid it, I don't live in the USA where people are ok with guns, she didn't like the idea of me killing someone who was just planning to steal a couple of oranges out of fear, I asked for a crossbow and she told me there wouldn't be any weapons in her house if I wanted to keep the job.

I used to sleep in her tv room (I was not allowed but that's another story) because I would play my PS4 there until I fell asleep, always with a knife bellow my pillow, one day I heard steps on the floor below, and to my bad look I had sleep paralysis as soon as they woke me up, I could here these cautious steps going up the stairs cracking without being able to move, later they got to my couch, I had my face covered with the blanket.

I was trying to reach my knife but I just couldn't move, later I swear for my life that the guy gently put the cover out of my face, I could stare at him at that point, it was really dark and couldn't see past his hoodie, he had the cap on. After like 2 seconds and the adrenaline just rushing I snapped out with hit but the guy just banished, it was as if it was made of a shadow out of smoke, I swear I could see the smoke  like for 2 or 3 seconds before it disappeared towards one of the two paintings upstairs.

I told this to my friend and asked her if the paintings had some story behind them. She kinda laughed it off, and told me they were old but that a friar and some fruit had nothing to do with people made out of smoke wearing clothes from the 21st century.

That was like 5 years ago, I haven't had a similar experience since then, and I truly hope I just don't.
I don't believe in this kind of stuff, I don't know if I convinced myself over the years or if it happened so long ago it just doesn't feel real anymore. Still I like in a weird way that I could live something almost took out of an horror movie, real or not, what I perceived almost made me shit myself two times."

t3_fespfn,all_ads,"Whispering, movements and HEAVY breathing",Thetruthishere,"This started a few months ago, possibly September.

I was attempting to fall asleep, when I hear whispering in the corner of my bedroom. Now, I have a large air conditioner outside on my patio, but this whispering was loud enough to physically hear overtop the loud noises of the conditoner. Two voices, maybe female, maybe male, but couldn’t distinctively understand them, which would’ve gave me a clue if they were female/male.
I’m never prepared for these situations, so when I’m scared, I immediately turn on my light and read a book to get my mind off of things, and it helps me sleep.

The next happened in October. 
My dog (rip Baxter) was on my bed, sleeping. I was attempting to fall asleep as well, when I hear static electricity on my bedroom carpet. Like ZZZ. I was kinda scared, when I began to hear heavy breathing, as if you ran for a maybe 10-15mins non-stop. Me, being the skeptic I was, put my ear to my dog’s face, cause I know my dog can sometimes breath quite loudly. 
My whole body went stone cold. 

The heavy breathing was louder than my dog’s breathing, and I could hear it overlap. NOPE, NOT AGAIN! I pulled my string light as fast as I could, and IT STILL WAS HAPPENING, keep in mind, this is at the FOOT OF MY BED, very, very close. 

I began reading fast, heart pounding like I’ve never had before. Scrolling through the pages, the heavy breathing slowly, but surely, disappeared. 

A few nights after, I heard heavy footsteps downstairs, like my dad’s footwear, but I knew my dad was asleep, cause I could hear his snoring. My brother was on his phone in his room, or asleep, so he was home, and not away, so it couldn’t have been him.

This is one of the strange occurrences, that I actually did have a confirmed Paranormal Experience. I’ve only had two others, the shadow at scouts and Gnomes.

t3_fefpwi,all_ads,Demonic sounds,Thetruthishere," I am sharing this wherever I think would make sense .. So here goes.

I have lived in my apartment for 3 years now and other than things falling randomly that I would usually blame on my cats I have never experienced anything paranormal. My boyfriend claims to see white lights at night in our bed room but i don't know , I feel there is always a logical explanation for things.

Yesterday I felt particularly ""spooked"" in my apartment I felt like someone was behind me , like I felt a presence . But also I am a fat baby when it comes to these things so I never take myself seriously . Anyway this is where It gets weird. That night my phone rang I was expecting a call from my best friend. So I pick up and say hello. And what I heard was a doll like voice laughing and giggling . She has a 1  year old daughter who does not sound like that but I just assumed it was her , so i was like ""awww hi "" all the while being creeped the f out and wondering what her daughter who goes to bed at 8 was up at 12 am. Then it quickly cut to my friend and she was like "" Was that you ? what are you doing ? tell me you are joking with me ."" I felt the blood leave my face . I was like "" no what did you hear"" thinking she heard the same thing or maybe some static. She was in shock she told me she heard a demonic man voice say ""hellooooooooooooo"" clearly and then cut to me saying hello. We spent the next few minutes arguing as she thought I was joking with her and I thought she was joking with me (even though she is not the type of person to do something like that ) . We established that it could have just been a weird glitch or something and left it at that.

I am so spooked from this lmao. Has anyone experienced something like this ? I never heard a sound like that in my life other than maybe in movies. I'm glad she heard something too because I feel like no one would have believed me .

I don't usually get static or anything on my cell phone . Neither of us were watching something on it before hand. And the sounds we heard were as clear as day.

help me find a logical explanation."
t3_ff5wk6,all_ads,What is this?,Thetruthishere,"So, sometimes my mind goes blank then my reflexes increase, my strength sky-rockets, my accuracy sky-rockets, and my hunting skills improve. Also, I remember everything when this happens and can control it and myself perfectly.

Example of hunting skills improving: I can track anything without having to look at them. I also can sense where people are around me and know details about them. I've named it Hunting Mode. Plus, I become very intimidating.

Examples of reflexes improving: I can block something from hitting me without even knowing it was there. I blocked my sister from hitting me from behind without knowing she was going to do it.

Example of accuracy improving: When I wanted to throw a pen at my sister to aggravate her. So, when her back was turned I decided to throw it at the back of her head. The only reason why it didn't hit her head is because she moved the last second. I was at least twenty feet away from her, and I was able to activate the ""Hunting Mode""

Example of strength improving: I was practicing using it then, my friend wanted to try to intimidate me by grabbing my shirt while getting in my face. So, I pushed him back and almost made him fall. I'm not usually strong enough to do that because he is a big guy.

Example of becoming intimidating: My friend doesn't like it when people push him, so he would usually become furious. That time he seemed horrified of me. Also, when I decided to look at myself in the mirror while doing it, it felt like it was tearing my mind apart. My eyes also looked like it was empty or there was just an endless, and empty abyss there.

Example of sensing people around me: My mind went blank and my head slowly rotated to where another person was in a car next to me. Even though I couldn't see the person there, I knew there was someone there, and I knew every detail about them. When I did see who it was in the car I was right about there gender, age and where they were located in the car (those are the only ones I could verify).

Can someone tell me what this is? I would appreciate all the help I can get on figuring out what this is. Is this like a predatory instinct, possession, some type of entity, or something?"

t3_fem41y,all_ads,Demonic type of screams and other strange noises in my neighbourhood,Thetruthishere,"Hi there! I just recently got this subreddit recommended to me by my phone and I thought I'd share some of my own experiences. You don't have to know absolutely everything about me but in my relatively short lifetime I've had some strange encounters. 2 years ago I moved from a relatively small village to a larger city, though in a pretty bad neighbourhood. And in these 2 years I've had the most haunting experiences I've ever had in any home I've lived in. Now as a bored teen I've practise and still practise some 'odd' hobbies like Tulpamancy and things related to that. And I know I'm not the most 100% sane person. However ever since the summer of 2019 I've heard strange noises coming from my neighbourhood and have seen strange lights in the skies. (I'll explain more about those lights in another post though. I've got them on video and camera). 
It started with odd clicking noises that would go on for a good 30 seconds to a minute before stopping and then returning later, with no set interval. It would usually be more than an hour, sometimes even 2 hours between the first clicking noises and the second clicking noises. And they would always start when it was about to turn pitch black outside. The sound was comparable to somebody taking a series of fast pictures or a fast camera shutter that was quite loud. It sounded eerily similar to one of the beasts from early videos from TheSunVanished oddly enough and when I first started hearing it I had a minor breakdown cause when I looked outside I also witnessed a red light while the sound was playing. But I've since debunked that light as just being a light from one of the neighbours backyards. That sound remained unanswered though.

It remained till around October-November when it dissapeared as suddenly as it initially appeared and was quickly replaced by a sound that would haunt my nights. A demonic screaming that hasn't stopped till this day. It's rather soft so It doesn't echo much further than my neighbourhood probably and usually appeares around 30 minutes before midnight and keeps going till around midnight. Occasionally I hear it way later at night aswell but that's a rare occurance. I have no clue what the source is and I'm unsure if I really want to know at this point. But luckily I haven't been attacked by anything demonic (directly). And I've grown somewhat used to it now.
I've asked my mom about these noises and she said she's never heard them directly. However she has been woken up by the rattleing and shaking of our backyard garden fence, this could all just be the wind aswell however. Near the end of 2019 our backyard fence gate got ripped out of its seem aswell. I've passed it off as the wind aswell just being to powerfull for the old gate however. My stepfather did quickly replace it with an all new fence while the old fence was suposedly ok, but he's done similar things before so it's not out of the ordinary.

What do you think? I'd be thrilled to read what you guys think of this and if you guys want to hear more of my personal experiences. Like the getho sky lights or my personal experiences as somebody with headmates and more. But for now I need to go to bed as work continues as normal in these trying Corona times. Night, reddit!"

t3_fei1h0,all_ads,Nightmares and Strange noises,Thetruthishere,"Nightmares and weird noises

So for some background, I moved into a new apartment back in mid January. The apartment we moved into were older but had just been renovated and were super homey feeling and cozy. I honestly love my apartment and have no issues with it at all, no creepy vibes,  actually I feel super at peace there. The problem started last weekend, I went to sleep around 9 on Saturday and was woken up around 11:30 by the sound of someone stomping up the stairs of the apartment next to me. I looked outside, no neighbors car, thought it was weird but whatever and went to sleep. Starting from then every hour I would have a nightmare, wake up and see it was an hour from when I had went to sleep, and this repeated every hour until 4am when I would last until I woke up for work. This repeated almost down to the minute for 4 days . The only break i had was Wednesday when I stayed up till 12 and there was no stair noise and when I went sleep no nightmares at all. Last night I laid down around 9, wife as well. 11:30 came and there came the noise, just as some insight the neighbor has not been home in like 2 weeks, not sure why. I heard the noise, looked at my wife to tell her but she did not wake up. Went back to sleep and there’s a nightmare again, I woke up at 12:40 and more annoyed than anything, decided to stay awake till after 3 and then laid down. The clock passed 3 and I went to bed and slept like a baby. At this point I just want to sleep, any suggestions on what’s happening and how I can make it stop?"

t3_fdwgrk,all_ads,I thought my mom came into my room and was looking through my things while I “slept” until I heard her walking upstairs,Thetruthishere,"So like 2 nights ago, it was around 1am and I heard someone coming down the stairs. I thought it was my mom so I pretended to sleep while I listened to my door very slowly but loudly crack open. (It’s pitch dark in my room so I can only feel and hear everything it does) as soon as it comes in, it comes up to me and rubbed something that felt like a jacket on my face for about 5 seconds. It chills there for a second before walking to the foot of my bed and I think it was literally just standing there. But then it goes to the other side of my bed (to my back) and lays on the very edge of my bed for maybe 5 minutes. Then it gets up and starts going through my closet and I got so confused when I could hear it rustling through the hiding spot in it, but it did that for another 5 minutes until it came back around to the other side of my bed and started searching under my pillow or something. Only for a minute before it sat on the bed beside me (I’m not sure but I think I heard a sigh) for only a minute, then it actually lays right beside me, like I can feel it solidly against me. It stayed there for about 3 minutes, but then I heard my mom walking upstairs in her room, and that’s when I got really fucking scared, but that’s not even the worst part. 5 seconds after hearing my mom upstairs, another one walks up to me from my door and crouches down beside me. Then I be like “yo wtf”, turn my phone on for a light and nothing is there.

Edit: I forgot to mention how I am constantly being bothered by it now, literally rnrn

Update: another freaky ass fucking thing that happened was yesterday, my mom came into my room to pray (she’s Christian) for something I can’t remember. But the entire time I was sitting there with my eyes closed, I could feel one of them standing in front of me, pacing back and forth. Sometimes I can hear an actual footstep, this shit has been getting so fucked, whatever this ghost wants, it wants it bad because it reeeallyy isn’t scared in the slightest of me knowing it’s there (though that could be my own fault, as I haven’t been doing anything to ward it off, and maybe even been more welcoming).

t3_fe6t3u,all_ads,Mandela effect,Thetruthishere,Am I allowed to post about the Mandela effect in here? I know it’s now really anything paranormal but I had a strange case of it today.
t3_fe9tb3,all_ads,Unexplained,Thetruthishere,"Ok, so I’ll try to make this as “interesting”.

This setting takes place in my grandmother’s house. Which, also my aunt, and now deceased great uncle lived. Growing up, I’ve always been interested in the paranormal, ghosts, etc. Trust me, there has been a lot of spooky things that has happened in that house, some that I still remember till’ this day. Anyways, my uncle would always tell me these different stories. How there’ll be children, or even a woman, entering and exiting his room. Whenever I’d always ask for more details, he’ll tell me “There gonna come for you!” which used to scare the fuck outta me. Now, this is something that remains unexplainable. Every night, my uncle would alwayss end off the night by having full blown conversations with himself, like, actual conversations. Sometimes, he’d be sleep, or just staring off into the corner of the room, or at the television. Whenever this’d happen, my grandma would always send me or my aunt off to check. Which I enjoyed doing, because once again, I was into the spooky shits. One thing I noticed was, whenever I’d put my hand on the door knob, the room will suddenly get quiet. Sometimes, the conversations would continue if you opened the door. My grandma, and aunt, also noticed this. After this, we decided to let it be. I mean, this WAS like one of his night routines. Before my uncle’s final days, it was like, the energy that was there... was suddenly gone? Still feels that way. Can’t really describe it, but I feel like, the spirits were attached to him in some kind of way."

t3_fdydji,all_ads,Wife and I both touched by a hand,Thetruthishere,"Last night I went to bed later than my wife. I was having trouble sleeping, and sometime between 12:30 and 1:30 I felt a hand on my hip, and then I felt it slightly clench. I thought it was my wife,  so I reached over to grab her arm, only it wasn't there. She was asleep and facing away from me. I tried to put it out of my mind and go to sleep, which I was eventually able to do so.

This morning I told my wife about it and she got a look on her face and told me that she had a similar experience last night where she felt a hand on her shoulder.

We've been in this house four years and this is the first strange experience we've had. Even after both of our mom's died we didn't have any strange activity in the house. Recent changes in our house include a bathroom remodel, installation of lights in the room below our bedroom, and the addition of another child to our family."
t3_fe4g8m,all_ads,A room is just... to dark,Thetruthishere,"I was at my brothers house and we both were in the kitchen talking, and I got this feeling that something was watching me. I told my brother and then decided to walk into the room to see if there was someone there. I walked into the room and despite the fact that there was a light on it was darker in there than outside, and it was nighttime. I immediately got a chill on my neck and back of head followed by extreme terror and I started tearing up (I’m not a cryer or an anxious person by any means). I tried to be stubborn and stay in the room but my terror won and I had to run out of the room. My brother managed to take a picture to see if we could see anything on his iPhone X with the flash on. It didn’t light up the room at all, except for about a foot in front of the camera and he had to turn his brightness up all the way just for us to see the furniture in the picture. The room is about 10x8 feet and with that iPhone there should have been more detail"
t3_fe9h9e,all_ads,My experiences with various dark figures,Thetruthishere,"I'm 20 years old, I have no known mental disorders aside from depression, and I had never had any experiences with the paranormal until moving to a small town in Indiana.

I'd lived in the state for the first 16 years of my life, and then I moved to the small town and almost immediately had odd experiences, thumping in my walls, photos falling off the wall, something scratching along my garage as it walked down the alleyway, things that made me very uncomfortable. It wasn't until roughly a year or a year and a half after I moved there that I started to see things, I saw a tall, black figure that was approximately 11 feet tall (Roughly level with the street sign it was standing nearby) and I even saw this thing in my house once; it was standing by a window and it darted behind a shelf of mine towards the stairs (My room is on the second floor) the next day when I checked the window, I realized it had been unlocked (And cracked open slightly) this one was smaller, at around 7 feet.

I've talked to my brother about it and we've both seen things that are extremely close in stature to the other, and we've also seen (Briefly) things that look much larger that 12 feet.

Not sure if anyone has experienced similar things, but I wanted to share."
t3_fdnqy3,all_ads,The man next door,Thetruthishere," For context, I'm a girl and the major part of this story happened when I was in 8th grade. I  lived in the same house from the age of 4 until I turned 21. It was a  duplex, meaning there were two houses on the same  property, with a  large backyard. Our property manager had turned part of his garage into a  small bedroom and had rented it out to a man.

My  family moved in to the home closest to the backyard when I was 4. My  dad being the friendly guy he is, made friends with the man living in  the small bedroom across from our home. This man was older, maybe in his  late 40's or early 50's. Always reeked of alcohol and cigarettes, wore  glasses, and had crooked teeth. The works.

Over  the years, he'd watch me closely, in a creepy way. He'd only leave his  door cracked open, about an inch, and I'd see his glasses gleam as he  watched me play with friends or by myself. He would always try to tempt  me to come to him with money or candy.

As  I got older, I started inviting my middle school friends to my home. A  few of them would comment on the weird man staring at us. I remember a  time where I said ""He's staring at us again."" and one of my guy friends  responded with ""He's not staring at us, he's watching YOU.""

My best friend, and yes she is the same best friend I've been mentioning in my last two stories. We'll call her Karin.

Karin  and I had been super invested in Naruto, we'd always watch it on our  spare time together. One of the characters Jiraiya, was a super pervert  who would lurk around women, Naruto called him pervy sage. So we started  calling the creepy old man Pervy Sage as well. (Sorry Jiraiya.)

Late  one night maybe around 8pm or 9pm, when i was about 13 or 14, Karin and I were in my dining  room area, sitting at the computer with my dog on my lap. My parents  were at work, my older brothers were in their room(they share the master  bedroom). They were hanging out with their friends.

I  recall hearing my front door open but not thinking much of it. That's  until I smelled the stench of cigarettes and alcohol, we looked to our  left and saw him inside my home. But neither of us said anything, Karin  and I were both in shock. He walked up to us and stood behind me. He  began to play with my hair asking what we were doing. Karin and I just  sat there, not knowing what to say, he knew my parents weren't home. She  blurted out we were ordering pizza online and typed in Pizza Hut on the  search bar. She later told me if we ordered pizza a grown up would come  and we could tell him/her what was wrong.

The  man did not budge, he continued to play with my hair. Karin got up and  nervously said ""I'm gonna ask your brothers if they want anything on  their pizza"" and with that she ran to her right, straight down the  hallway, and bolted through my brothers' door.

I had just finalized the pizza purchase and heard her scream ""Pervy Sage is acting weird!""

The  man spoke only spanish, I doubt he knew what she said, but with that I  grabbed my dog and ran towards my brothers room and repeated it. ""Pervy  sage is acting weird!""

Both Karin  and I were blurting out how weird he weird was being and how he came in  uninvited. I can imagine, we both  looked hysterical. My brothers, told us to get the fuck out of their room.

I'm  not sure if they were trying to look cool in front of their friends but  I knew how they were, if I didn't do as they asked, I'd get beat up or  told off. Karin and I looked at each other sort of defeated, we closed  their bedroom door and stood in front of it for a second.

We looked back where we originally sat but the man was not there. Karin  and I ran to the kitchen, grabbed two knives and ran into my bedroom and  locked the door. She sat on the bed with my dog and I sat on the floor,  trying to listen or feel if he was walking around my house. My house  was old, it would easily shake when someone walked around, so I felt if I  sat on the floor I'd feel it if he were inside.

My  bedroom had two doors... One with a lock that connected to the hallway.  The other, with no lock, connected to my parents room, which was right  next to the front door of the house.

Karin  and I heard his footsteps in the living room once more then silence. We both  looked at each other in horror. We both rushed to the second door and  pushed against it just in time to stop him from opening it. The man  pushed for about 30 seconds before stopping. The moment he stopped Karin  and I took the opportunity to push a dresser into the door to barricade  it.

About  15 minutes of us sitting on my bed, knives in hand,  we heard the pizza guy arrive. With that the man was gone, back in his  hole of a bedroom, outside my home. We locked the front door and ate our  pizza.

We didn't call police,  because of where we lived, we thought 'who'd believe two kids?'. A few  days later Karin and I reported everything to our school counselor, she  was an amazing caring woman, she was always there for us no matter what  we needed, so we trusted her enough to tell her what had happened. She made a full report,  and interviewed us  both separately to make sure we weren't lying.

She called us both into her office the next day and let us know she had called police to report the incident but they  told her ""We cannot do anything until something happens.""

Karin was furious, ""are we supposed to be found dead in a ditch for them do something?"" I can still hear her saying this to this day.

Our  counselor called our parents to report the incident. Karin's parent's  didn't seem to care, their divorce was more important. My dad asked me  if it was true and said he'd talk to the guy. My brothers came to me  saying ""if he comes near you tell us."" all of a sudden they cared.

My  dad remained friends with the man. The man stopped talking to me for years but  never stopped watching. When I was 16, Karin and I were hanging out near  the front of the property, the man had ridden his bike near us and said  ""You're attitude has changed."" (in spanish) This was the first time he said anything to me since the event two to three years prior. So I told him ""I'm not a  kid anymore, I know what you are, and I can fight back."" Karin glared at  him. He moved away shortly after that.

Karin  and I lost touch after he moved away, we both went to different high  schools and for the first two years we tried our hardest to remain in  contact, but we grew apart. That and her mom had her moving from place  to place after the divorce.

I grew up with trust issues around men due to that man. Just something I'm slowly trying to get over.

I'm  24 now, the last time I saw him I was in my dad's car and he was riding his bike down the street, but that was back when I was about 18. I haven't seen him since."
t3_fdgph4,all_ads,The woman in the elevator.,Thetruthishere,"Below is a recounting of a real-life strange encounter my boyfriend and I had recently with what we both believe to have been a being that was not of this world in our apartment building. The story has not been embellished for dramatic effect in that I have not changed any of the details of the story to make it a better story, it is as true as I remember it to have happened to us. 
Discussion is welcomed. I hope you enjoy the tale! 




The familiar chime rang out, reverberating off the cement block walls as the elevator doors slid open. In the months we’d been living in the building, we’d only rarely shared the elevator with anyone else, but this time there was a woman on the lift already. She didn’t acknowledge our presence as we got on the elevator with her, she just stood there in the back corner, expressionless. I reached in front of her to press the button to take us down to the ground floor. The buttons for the 5th and 6th floors were illuminated as though they had already been pressed, as was the button for the basement. The doors slid closed and the elevator cables began to creak and groan as they pulled us upwards. The elevator stopped on the 5th floor and with a chime the silence filling the space was broken and the doors opened. There was no one there waiting to get on, and the woman in the corner made no move to exit the elevator. I looked over my shoulder at Matt; we shared a look of mild confusion, but didn’t think much of it. Perhaps the woman had accidentally pressed the buttons for both floors; a simple mistake. After a moment the doors closed again and we were hoisted the rest of the way up to the 6th floor. Another chime and the doors slid open. Again, no one was there; again the woman made no move to exit. Nervous laughter escaped me as I glanced over at the woman. She remained expressionless, her eyes almost lifeless; she looked dull, there was no lustre to her hair or skin. She was elderly and wore a long winter coat, a fur hat, and boots - clean and fashionable, but dated. She hadn’t moved an inch since we stepped onto the elevator 2 floors ago. She didn’t shift her weight from one side to the other, she didn’t adjust her grip on the bag she was carrying, she didn’t make a sound. A sense of dread washed over me - I didn’t want to spend another second on the lift with this strange woman. I wanted to exit the elevator right there on the 6th floor and take the stairs down. I looked at Matt and I could tell he was on the same page, but before we could make our move, the doors closed again. The elevator began its descent, the cables creaking as we were lowered towards the ground. The display above the elevator doors flashed the numbers for each floor as we passed them. 5 - 4 - 3 - 2.. as we finally reached the ground floor, the elevator shuddered as it came to a stop. There was a long pause before the familiar chime finally rang out and the doors slid open. We got off the elevator as fast as we could, not taking the time to look back at the woman in the corner. She did not exit the elevator with us. We could only assume she took the lift the rest of the way down to the basement. We hurried out of the building and across the parking lot to the car. We sat there in the car for a while, watching the doors for the woman to leave the building, but she did not. We had never seen her before that day, and we have never seen her again; the woman in the elevator."
t3_fdnbbr,all_ads,Turn lights off with my mind,Thetruthishere,"I saw a post that was archived from 6 years ago. I wanted to add-  This has been happening to me my whole life. My sister, mom, ex boyfriend and husband can attest to it. Have freaked my sister out before. One time when I was in high school I was too lazy to turn the light off and pictured it dark in my mind (eyes closed with pillow in my face) and I hear her say “did you do that?”. Apparently the light went out for a few seconds. 
The lights blow when I flip the switch, or turn off for multiple seconds (not touching them) , or flicker- usually when I’m very angry or I feel a surge of emotion.
 I also have bad luck with electronics and causing them to break. 
If I space out staring at the tv I can make it go static or flicker.
 I also feel the energy in the wind and feel it pick up if I really try, and can bring out the sun...
Idk thought I was crazy. 
Glad to know it’s not just me."
t3_fdrn3v,all_ads,Abduction dream,Thetruthishere,"This was years ago but I remember it clearly because for awhile I was convinced I was abducted. Now I’m not so convinced.

It was one of those dreams where you “wake up” but you’re actually still sleeping. So I “woke up” and I seen my sister sleeping on her bed on the other side of the room. I remember thinking that she sleeps in crazy positions. I walked out of our room. And headed towards the back. I unlocked the latch to the back door. Opened the screen door. It was dark but looked as if it was about to be day soon. I walked down the backyard. And a thick green laser appeared. Probably with the thickness of a marker. I walked into it and then woke up. Dream? Or abduction?"
t3_fd57z5,all_ads,The Doll Has Arrived...Follow up as promised!,Thetruthishere,"Hello all!

As I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/f9ziia/will_soon_possess_a_haunted_dollsuggestions_for/) I now possess a potentially haunted doll. I promised I would post an update, and so, here we are. 

Doll in containment: [Here](https://i.imgur.com/EoP73VW.jpg)

It's under 24/7 watch. The camera does motion detection, and also takes a still image every single minute. It alerts me to motion and also records 15 seconds before, and after the motion as a separate video.

Currently, he resides in a large glass jar. After speaking to a few different people, it was suggested I start small. Glass is made from sand, so a fully glass jar is ""akin to burying it"". For now, I felt that was a good start, and will increase as needed.

This was also suggested because if I start strong, the entity may see that as a challenge.

The two black boxes, one on each side: These are mini EMF detectors.

They glow blue as seen in this short video: [Video](https://i.imgur.com/OVnnApp.mp4)

They are pretty sensitive and will react to EMF even from across the room. For example, when my cat runs across the carpet, that little bit of static will make them react if they are within about 5 feet. They glow brighter, the stronger the EMF.

These two pictures should explain how they are helping with the investigation:

[One](https://i.imgur.com/jd5PbMJ.jpg)

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/vpe4jvZ.jpg)

In the first image, you can see the constant small glow they give off while next to the jar. Not even touching the jar.

The second image shows one of them moved to the wall, away from the jar by two inches, and is no longer glowing. You will see the left one is still glowing. I have a bunch of these that I use to make a circle, or other design, around investigation areas. It helps track the movement of entities/energy.

I have done one Spirit Box session, and one EVP session so far, but have received no contact. I did a reading with a separate EMF detector, and it gave me a strong reading at first, but then it stopped a moment or two later.

I will, of course, update more in the future when/if anything else happens.

No nightmares so far!

Someone below asked about my prior experiences, and I uploaded some old EVPs and recordings I did. Here is the comment, and my reply with the link:

&gt;Damn how was living in a haunted house? Did it scare you? And what kind of voice was there? Those over nights sound intense. That would’ve been fucking awesome. And damn that’s dope how you got the doll. Do they have big over night hunt events? So many questions lol.

You know, it's kinda funny really. My friends and family kept telling me all these ghost stories, and I just never really experienced anything, despite being a believer. I never heard the footsteps, I never saw things move.

In 2008, we had a kitchen fire, and the second floor took so much smoke damage that my brother and I ended up having to sleep in the living room. The back wall had a large opening for the kitchen, that went along to the bathroom as well. As I was laying there, late one night, I saw a swirling mass of colors exit the boarded up kitchen, walk along the wall, and into the bathroom.

At that time I was experimenting with astral projection, and hypnogogic imagery, so I assumed it was that. The next morning, my brother asked me ""Did you see the lady in white?""

I asked him what he meant, and he said he woke up around 3am, and saw a woman in a white dress come out of the kitchen, walk down the wall, and into the bathroom.

----

After that, I started hearing little noises, little taps. I heard my name said a few times. I started recording, and caught EVPs, two of which are my name, and two being longer sentences. One saying my name freaked the ever living fuck out of me, so I stopped recording. It wasn't that it was my name, but HOW it was said.

So, I was using an app called 'sleepbot' that records noises while you sleep. Fun for hearing you snore, ya know?

In order to use it, you leave it on the bed around your head, and if you move, it captures that as well.

Around 5am, I was half awake, and I swore I heard something. I rolled over, grabbed my phone, and hit stop. I then hit play on the last 30 seconds...it was my name, but it WASN'T an EVP in my opinion. I hear the entity take a deep breath, and say my name, before drawing more air through it's teeth. But as it says my name, wind goes over the microphone of of the phone. Just a foot from my head. (Uploaded the recordings to drive for your enjoyment: [EVP/Recordings](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1YEciZ0QwCqsjP_xdegOIuaSuvq3Ui_YH) (Uploaded to Mega.nz as well since some are having issues downloaded from google drive) [Here](https://mega.nz/#!Kt8FFaiL!IqFp9_Nx4MJZmfJQQtcCcfBWXItwTP9_KZPLMVyD4d8)

I heard it, and immediately got the fuck up. Ended up spending the rest of the morning in the kitchen smoking with all the lights on. I stopped recording after that, as it was clear I was getting too close.

After my experiences years later in bank repossession work, I renewed my interest.

To answer the final question, yes, both of those do public and private ghost hunts."
t3_fdj45l,all_ads,Looking for video,Thetruthishere,"Okay so i dont know if this is the right sub to post this in but years and years ago I was on tour in Columbus and met these girls who had all these really crazy stories is weird and paranormal shit they knew about. I remember them showing me and a couple friends this video that stuck with me and I have now looked for it sporadically for the last few years and I cannot find it at all. 

So the video was two people searching like an abandoned/haunted house (I believe in California but not positive) and they walk up the stairs and this y’all man/thing ducks under the doorway I think he was in a robe and holding a lantern and I remember it looking very believable. The people exploring screamed bloody murder before running out of the house. Anyone have any idea of what I’m talking about? Thanks."
t3_fdhus6,all_ads,My stuff keeps going missing,Thetruthishere,"Hello every one to my knowledge no one has died in my house and no old things have ever been brought in to it. Yet I have a problem, I have a small pillow I have been sleeping with my whole life and it is always where ever I sleep. I have been having my gf over and we sleep in the guest bed because it is bigger then my own. Any way the only two rooms this pillow should be in is my room and the guest room. I have searched my whole house top to bottom for cleaning reasons and looking for this. I have also lost a thc vape and a nic vape and they were always on me. I know most of you will say oh you probably miss placed it but there are other weird thing going on in my house. For example i wake up before my gf for work so when I am up I hear foot steps in my house and we are the only ones home. I told her this recently and she turned white and said she hears them when I fall asleep before her. I have been thinking about burning sage in my house not really to sure what to do. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this, hope y’all have a great day or night."

For fun, I joined and instantly said into chat ""33 pls"" ""then i leave"". What do you think the next roll is? 33. Idk, but it thought it was funny lol.

t3_fd7z33,all_ads,Do you ever feel like you’ve lived your life a million times?,Thetruthishere,It’s like you’re riding your bike on a well worn path.  You can easily veer from the path but you often fall back in.  It’s a feeling of having parts of life being familiar.  Not exactly deja vu but just having a comfort or an understanding of periods of your life?
t3_fd960g,all_ads,Saw something weird when I was falling asleep,Thetruthishere,"About 2 weeks ago, one night I was about to fall asleep and my eyelids felt very heavy and it uncontrollably closed but then I saw a very clear image ( on the back of my eyes ). The image was of four silhouettes of ""people"" standing close to me (so that I can only see from the torso and above) in a blurred yellowish green background. I can tell that the head of the silhouette were elongated and had no hair. But then as soon as I saw this ""image"" I got scared and woke up, so must've seen the image for only a second. When I closed my eyes again I didn't see anything. I couldn't sleep for sometime but eventually did. It was like, for a second the image was there and the next it was gone. 

Does anyone have any answers or speculations?"
t3_fctx2v,all_ads,"OK, here it goes... anyone used to be an atheist but encountered/experienced something that changed you into a believer of God?",Thetruthishere,"I recently read a post on the subreddit for paranormal activity that shared an experience between two friends that found a doll off trail of a hike route, one of the friends was an atheist and didn’t find the doll to be creepy at all and the other friend was a believer and was getting strange vibes and the creeps from the doll. So they for some reason decided to take the doll home(I know right?! 😫😨😰). The atheist friend was the one who ended up taking the doll home since the other was creeped out by it and it turns out the doll was possessed/cursed and crazy ass events happened that lead to the point where the atheist friend fled from his house to his friends apartment! While he explained the events to his friend, he was breaking down in tears! 😣😔 And so, that made me wonder, how many more people have had a similar experience to go from not believing  to believing super quick, or at least just to believing period?! By the way, I am a believer myself for many years, for as long as I can remember actually. I started to experience paranormal activity at a very young age, and it didn’t help that my aunt(were not close AT ALL) she would practice black magic at the time. I could go on and on, but this is about YOU GUYS! Lol 🤩"
t3_fdcgpc,all_ads,I saw something on my way to my extra English class,Thetruthishere,"About 9 years ago, I'd usually have to go to an extra English class on Tuesday and Thursday. On the way there was an abanded building mixing with a feildwith of tall grass, a bunch of big trees and dense bushes.
It was always pretty quiet there, lack of people and there even a Chihuahua alway looks at me all weird.
When ever I'm on that road, I felt like I'm being watch or follow. One time, it was just a regular day, without wind at that time of the day,I was on my way to that class as usual, and, at the coner of my eyes, I saw a big shadow jumping from tree to tree, it wasn't even humanoid, I immediately look back at the spot where I catched a glimp of this mysterious figure, only to find the trees moving as if there was any wind. The shadow figure disappeared, leaving me with fear, I continue my way to class, walking faster because I thought the shadow figure is still following me, but not to fast 'cause I don't want anyone to stop by and ask why am I running in terror and won't believe me.
Later on that year, it was fall, I had calm myself down from the mysterious incidence that happened months ago, I was enjoying the day, stepping on the fallen leaps to hear that crunchy sound, when I got out of the part of the road which is covered in leaps, I heard those crunchy sound again, but it wasn't me, so I looked back just to find nobody's there. Since the class was near, I rushed to the gate, headed straight to the class, heavy breathing.
A few mouths later, my mom said I don't have to go to that class anymore.  assume she did some talk with the teacher, and thank God she did, I don't have to go to that damn road anymore. And if I do, I'm gonna go by bike, with my sister."

I remember thinking ""making a fork with a fork haha"" 15 minutes later I run into a guy making a spoon with only a spoon. 

This isn't the first time something like this happens. Sometimes I have deep thoughts or puzzle I ponder about. Then, later that day or even a week later I stumble upon something similar. 

Test this yourself, maybe tomorrow you will see an orange out of nowhere."
t3_fda074,all_ads,A guy’s suicide I felt?,Thetruthishere,"4 days ago my older sister and I were watching the Avs vs Panthers game, lightly drinking for boosted excitement watching the Avs make franchise history.

I slept not long after that bc I got so tired then woke up a little before 4:00 a.m. I’m scrolling through reddit when suddenly I’m hit with this immense fear.

I go to the living room bc I can’t stand being in the last room anymore and plus my sister was also sleeping in the living room and there was only us 2 and her 4 little kiddos. 

I keep feeling this fear like something is waiting for just the right moment to jump scare me and I’m seriously thinking I should commit suicide cause that’s how scared I was. I want to cry, or wake my sister up but if she fell back asleep it would only scare me even more.  I can’t go back to sleep either bc every time I close my eyes it’s like the presence gets stronger and I feel like I’m going to die. I would have fallen asleep easily laying on my back but I deal with sleep paralysis so there’s just no way.

I’m scared but don’t know what to do. I think about climbing out the window and walking home but it was so dark. 
I decide to wait til it gets light outside maybe I’ll be more comfortable in closing my eyes. 

I keep hearing house noises that makes my heartbeat pick up pace. Shadows I see from the sides of my eyes that make me wish I could just be dead already. 

My stomach is hurting and I’m trying to hold in my insides cause I don’t want to go to the bathroom and puke. 

In all the fear is everywhere and I feel so little against it.

When it starts to lighten up outside and it’s close to the kiddies waking up I start to feel comfortable and let my guard down. Bad mistake, I start to hear this weird sound like something heavy being dragged. I look around trying to figure out where it’s coming from when all of a sudden the blanket that covers the front door (bc I live in a cold area and it’s winter here) pushes up and the front door opens. I swear to god my soul left my body at that moment, I’m so scared but I go close the door then go lay next to my sister under the blanket til she wakes up, when she does I go straight to sleep.

Later that day after I wake up my sister told me Branden a.k.a “big so” passed away, I don’t even know the guy but apparently he passed away of suicide downing bottles of pills.

 Did he burrow my body or something like that if anyone knows what I’m talking about bc it’s just so weird and that’s not the only time me feeling an odd deep feeling that didn’t feel like was mine unless I’m just over thinking things idk."
t3_fd9txp,all_ads,2 experiences,Thetruthishere,"I posted this to the  Paranormal sub reddit and figured I would share here. I have more stories btw

So Ive said this before please forgive my structsring with writing.

During the summer after finishing my freshman year a few buddies and I were just hanging out all day into the next morning(around 3 to 4 am) we decided to stay at my place that night to play games and watch tv. So arounf 3 or 4 am we decide to head down to the basement to sleep since we had a reclinging couch and a love seat. Well I was ready to sleep but my 2 friends were not so they kept talking and trying to get me into the conversation. So while we sat in out spot reclined we heard pounding upstairs like someone was running down the stairs, then a loud bang, and a scream. The scream didnt sound like anyone in the house which made this even more weird. We shot up from our spot and all looked at each other for a few seconds before we all said ""did you hear that?"". I pointed out that it didnt sound like my Dad but it didnt sound like someone broke in either so we rush upstairs to see what happened. Nothing was there or moved out of place so we freaked out and ran to my room just confused. We eventually passed out right away and the next morning my friend Aaron and I told my mother what happened. She went from it was probably one of the animals but when we told her it couldnt have been it then turned into it must have been your father. So I pointed out if it was my Dad you would have heard him get up and then go back upstairs which no one heard. He had an average body type during this time and id maybe an inch smaller than me you would have heard him go back up stairs.

Since that was shorter than my last post Ill give you guys another short story. During my JR year of high school so a few years later I had 2 friends over on a school night. These 2 were like family to us so my Mom was aleays cool with it as long as we were home on time and in bed at a decent time. So my friend Aaron who lived with us was up in my room studying and doing home work while my friend Orlando and I were in the living room. Orlando was watching TV while I was on the computer trying to get a game running on the computer. Orland shuts off the TV and says ""Im going to head upstairs man"" so I tell him ""wait up Im going to shut this off"". I was secretly afraid to shut off everything downstaors because of how creepy the house was at night which resulted in me shutting everything off and running upstairs. So as I stand up we hear through the vents someone yelling. Like an actual person yelling not like air blowing through the vent. I swear it sounded like my name being called my friend claims he just heard a yell. He looks at me and nopes out while I press the power button the pc and run up stairs. Aaron my other friend looks at us and asks why were freaked out so we told him. It was just weird."
t3_fdb9lm,all_ads,I saw a strange humanoid in my room.,Thetruthishere,"This occurred when when I was about 9 years old, 9 years ago. I was sleeping in my bed, remember having a bit of cold; I'd cough every 3 minutes and had a slight fever. I will try to, as vividly as possible, describe the situation to you so that you may see it from my perspective.

On the left side of my bed was a window, covered with curtain. I remember waking up at around 3:30 am and saw a shadow behind the window, clear as day just standing there, fixed. It looked like a teenage boy with liberty spikes hair, the hairstyle is something I have not been able to forget. I remember my heart started pounding fast. It was terrifying. I remember being awake, it wasn't even a dream and I was not hallucinating, nor do I have any mental problems.

There were only four people in the house: Mom, Dad and my sister. I saw my sister asleep on the bed right by my side and I know Mom and Dad will not wear a spiky wig and stand outside my window. So, for 9 years, I have been pretty much clueless as to what I saw.

Please tell me what it could be."
t3_fd044n,all_ads,Yellow orbs in the night,Thetruthishere,"I’d say this happened around spring in 2012 if my memory serves me correctly. I was about 11 at the time and I was home with my dad. My mum and sister had gone to bed and me and my dad stopped up watching TV. It was about 11pm at this point and we was about to go to bed so my dad went to take the bins out for the bin men the next morning. He was gone for 30 minutes. By the time he came in the house he told me he saw a 2 bright yellow orbs that lit up the whole night sky. 

Naturally we both stopped up staring out of the upstairs window to see if this would occur again.  It got to about 12-12:30am where it happened again. The orb appeared from out of nowhere and the whole sky went from pitch black to bright yellow. It was there for 30 seconds and then suddenly disappeared

We stopped up all night to see if anything else would happen but it didn’t. However the same thing happened 3 times within one night. Has anyone else experienced anything like this before?"
t3_fcnny3,all_ads,Have you ever met a reptilian shapeshifter?,Thetruthishere,
t3_fcpw2l,all_ads,"I hate how cliche this sounds, but I had an experience on Friday the 13th",Thetruthishere,"To preface this, I'm pretty sure the area my friend lives in has occultists because we've had a few strange run ins while out in the wooded suburbs. We just try to ignore strange happenings but also tempt fate a bit which is why we went out walking at night on Friday the 13th. There aren't too many streetlights and sometimes the sidewalks abruptly end so it was dark enough that walking or driving around would require use of a flashlight or headlights (especially to avoid deer). 
Anyway since it was the weekend and we were bored high schoolers at the time, we decided the nearby elementary school would be empty this late at night and we could mess around on the playground. We had an uneventful 20 minute walk over and jumped a medium fence into the playground. Another 20 yards or so further was the front of the school. The front face of the school had a looped road off the main road we walked on, and the only lights on were the outdoor ones on the school's entrance. The front of the school was empty when we walked to the playground, and we sat on the swings talking for half an hour before I noticed there was a cop car sitting outside the school front.
I pointed it out to my friend and she froze.
It was silent outside all night. Neither of us heard the car pull up. The angle the swings were at meant that a car pulling up would've cast it's headlights right on us, which we would've also noticed, but there were no lights. No other cars had passed by either. The car was parked there silently in the dark with only the school's front lights on it. Everything felt wrong about it, it was even an older model car that the county doesn't use anymore. It was kinda hard to see in the dark, but it looked like there was a lone pale figure in the driver's seat with no facial features. A completely smooth face.
My friend and I calmly got off the playground, jumped the fence again and left the way we came. 
No idea what it was other than it seemed to appear out of nowhere and gave both of us really off putting vibes. Still gives me the chills years later."
t3_fcghy7,all_ads,Floating glowing orb,Thetruthishere,"This is an experience my mom and I had about 15 years ago in Yambol, Bulgaria. One summer night, past midnight, I don't know what made us wake up/look out of the window (since it was very late and I was young so I'm assuming we should have been asleep), but we looked and across the street in a little clearing area we saw a floating orb. It was yellowish/white and resembled the moon with its glow. It was about as big as a basketball. It floated about 5 feet off the ground and was levitating up and down and just glowing. We didn't know what it was and got scared so we closed the window and curtains and went to sleep. Only my mom and I saw it, since no one ever mentioned anything. My mom remembers it the same as I do. Has anyone had a similar experience? What could it have been? It was clearly a MASS so it wasn't like a projector light or anything like that..."
t3_fcs0qm,all_ads,Redditors what's something in life you think you have figured out that's a hard concept to grasp to other people,Thetruthishere,So here's my example : ive always thought that purgatory (from the Bible) was the same thing as living life here's what I mean by that. Purgatory is loosely described as a place where you go to redeem yourself from sins that you have made in your lifetime to so you have a chance to get into heaven. now here's my theory life is purgatory it explains alot about basic human things such as hatred and pain selflessness and deja Vu in particular in other words we aren't living are lives were living are lives on a rewind button in are minds to make better decisions then we made before which would to me explain why deja Vu only seems to pop up not at random times but a serious life changing decisions or events we think of them as random times most of the time though because we don't want to dig in ourselves deep enough to realise we did the same things before and or again I'd love to hear other people's examples and theories of their own .ps thanks for reading kind of new to Reddit but I really love it lots of love and awesome theories and story's .

t3_fbscqe,all_ads,Horror at Scout Camp,Thetruthishere,"So, In Canada, We have a scouts system similar to the US. Our System by level is Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Ventures. This happened during Cubs. 

So, there was this house on the property of the camp. Beautiful house, nice wooden smell, it was great. During this time, all the troops around us, gathered for a weekend up at the house. There were maybe 6-7 troops gathered, we would be doing wooden car racing, etc. 

The house was split into two rooms, one for males, other for females, and there was a closet doors connected to each room. At the time, there was maybe 10-20 guys in one room, and maybe 10-15 females. We would be sleeping on the floors with our sleeping bags. 
After brushing, me and the guys went back to the guys room. We were talking and one of the kids said that this place was haunted, and that the closet that leads into the girls section was where someone was hanged. 

Now, I’m not gonna lie, I always had a strange feeling of the doorway. So much in fact, that I specifically put my sleeping bag across the other side of the room. There was also an air vent there, that I was afraid as well, so I then moved it into the middle, even if I had to sleep in between two guys, I didn’t mind it.

That night, after the counslers shushed us to sleep, cause you know guys, we talk for hours on end if we don’t get told to sleep.

It was around maybe, 4:30. I awoke, my head facing towards the closet, when I notice something going down. The closet door, was slowly opening. I was kinda stunned, girls shouldn’t be peeping on guys. That’s when I see a shadow, no bigger than 6’. It was crazy tall for it’s size. Now, best I can describe from memory, is like the colour Vanta Black (Google it). It was very blurry, but crisp until the middle. It slowly inched it’s way across the wooden floor boards. No sound, nothing. It just silently passed each kid as it went by. I didn’t want this thing to see me, so I turned my head. It passed more kids, the more it went down. I was now trembling. I didn’t know what it wanted. It kept moving slowly, passing a few kids ahead of me, and then it happened. 

The more it got closer, the more I felt dread. Not only did I feel dread, but I felt the air getting colder. And not just the physical feeling cold, it felt cold in my insides. The air got more dry and cold, like Liquid Nitrogen. The greatest amount of that feeling happened when it passed me. I was maybe a few feet to the door, so when it went to the other entrance I was at, I’m not sh*tting you this, it was LITERALLY TURNING THE DOORKNOB. It pulled the door open, and slowly exited, before, strangely enough, shut the door behind itself.

That morning, We were getting up from bed, and walked down the rickity old steps. One of the kids said “Did you guys see that shadow last night”, and maybe 4 kids eyes widened. We all blurted “YES”. We talked about it for a short while, and let’s just say, after that experience. EVERYONE’s sleeping bag was moved to the other side of the room."

t3_fbyirb,all_ads,[CHI] The night after my grandfather died,Thetruthishere,"When a strange or an unexplained thing happens it usually lasts only a moment or perhaps only a few minutes and as the weeks, months and years pass by you're no longer certain of what you have actually witnessed, if anything at all. The story that I want to tell however is one where the unexplained has lasted a whole night, so the experience is unpleasantly fresh in my mind even though it happened more that two decades ago. Perhaps smarter people than me will be able to come up with a rational explanation, or maybe there will be someone who had similar experiences.

It happened in the late 90s when I was 13 years old. My grandfather, who lived in another town, has fallen ill and my parents had to leave in a hurry to assist my grandma. I was left to my own devices, and as any teenager my age I was more than happy to be alone with all the computer games I could play. At the time we were living in a small two bedroom apartment, with a dog that looked scary, but in reality was the kindest and gentlest animal.

I spend the whole day playing video games. By the time I would usually go to bed I got a call from my father telling me that grandpa died. He told me that they will be staying in the other town to arrange the funeral. I got upset and cried for a while. I didn't want to go to bed so I went to the kitchen and cooked a frozen pizza. It was almost midnight by the time I finished eating. I decided to watch some TV thinking that perhaps it will help me fall asleep. As I was changing channels I stumbled upon some porn. Being a teenager with no easy access to porn, my horniness overcame any sadness and I spend some time masturbating. After I was done I took a shower and went to bed.

As I was going to bed I called the dog into the room since she would just scratch the door if I were to leave her outside. I closed the bedroom door and cozied up under the blanket. This is when I began to hear strange sounds from the kitchen, with which my bedroom shared a wall. The sounds were exactly what you would hear when you place kitchenware on a table. For example when you put a cup on a counter-top, or a knife on a plate, only louder. I could distinctively hear those sounds, and there was no mistake that the sounds were coming from the kitchen.

The dog heard the sounds too, I looked at her and she was starring at the wall intently. Things started to get much noisier. Within minutes I could hear ruckus from beyond the wall. Plates hitting other plates, metal clanking, hollow sounds when something hits a wooden table and many more in a bizarre cacophony. I was literally paralyzed with fear, for the first half an hour I wouldn't dare to move. During that time the dog became livid and began barking, not at the wall but at the door.

As time passed I had ample time to reassure myself that this wasn't a dream, and that this was really happening. The dog kept barking at the door and I finally gathered some courage to move. I sat up and after staring at the wall for a while, I looked at the door. It looked as if I was safe, and I was certainly glad that the dog was with me in the room. During the next hours the commotion continued while I was able to get up from the bed and slowly approach the door. After a while I was holding the doorknob, but I never gathered up enough courage to actually open the door. It wasn't just my fear: when I looked at the dog I could see what I can only describe as terror in her eyes as she kept barking.

It took me some time to return and sit on the bed. An hour perhaps, since I was still afraid to move too quickly, partially because I didn't want to miss any of the noise coming closer, and partially because I was too afraid that I might attract attention of whatever it was that was making it. Once I was sitting I looked out of the window, but I couldn't see anything, it was pitch dark. I decided that the best strategy for me would be to sit quietly and wait for the morning.

As the dawn came I could hear the noise die out slowly just as it came. The noises became weak and rare enough that I could hear the building's elevator in the distance. And very soon the dog calmed down. Just sitting looking at me looking at her. I waited for about another hour and decided that it was probably safe to come out. When I entered the kitchen I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Everything was as I remembered it.

To this day I don't know what exactly was making that noise. All I know it was coming from the kitchen, it was strong and it lasted all night. I tried really hard to come up with a rational explanation. My line of thinking was that perhaps someone has broken in to the apartment. But the problem with that theory was that the front door, and the balcony door were both locked, there were no signs of break-in. And besides why would anybody break-in just to make noise, without taking anything and without leaving a trace.

The closest paranormal explanation is poltergeist. The problem is that I don't really believe in paranormal, so that “explanation” was never enough for me. I was shaky for about a week afterwards, afraid to sleep, but fortunately the hellish cacophony never came back."
t3_fbratg,all_ads,I knew what was in an envelope with 100% certainty without even seeing the contents before,Thetruthishere,"
So this happened a few years ago, but the memory stuck with me and I remember it clear as day. I’m Vietnamese and my family celebrates Lunar New Year every year which is a holiday where we exchange red envelopes as a tradition. (The red envelopes contain money and it’s for good luck for the new year). 

My grandma does this lottery thing where she puts a 5 or 10 dollar bill in every red envelope, but only ONE of them has a 100 dollar bill, which was the jackpot. I have quite a few cousins so maybe around like 10 or 15 (my grandma was holding like 30 envelopes tho because my aunts and uncles also get to choose one) and we line up from youngest to oldest. I was one of the older cousins so I’m never in the front.

When it was my turn to choose an envelope, there was this one envelope I just KNEW for certain that it had the 100 dollar bill. I can’t even describe the feeling. I just had this deep certainty about it. If u asked me to bet my life on it during that moment, I would have (just shows that I knew 100%). I chose it, no hesitation and I opened it up a few minutes later. It was the 100 dollar bill.

I tried to play it off as maybe it was just a rlly lucky coincidence, but I still couldn’t find a reason on how I just KNEW? I didn’t see any of the red envelopes before hand at all. Anyway, every year after that incident, I’ve been trying to see if I could get certainty feeling again and I haven’t had that same feeling since. I still have no rational explanation for it. Thoughts on this please? I could easily say it was a coincidence, but I wouldn’t be posting here if it weren’t for that strange feeling I got."

t3_fbgyng,all_ads,Something big has been lurking in my woods and my dogs know something is up... help?!,Thetruthishere,"So for a bit of context; I live in West-North-Western Georgia (US). I’m in the middle of nowhere, on a weird off-on-it’s-own cul de sac with houses on only one side and woods all around it. Other than the cul de sac houses are all over 100yards(m) away from each other. The woods are thick and begin about 30ft (10m) away from our house. 
The area is not known to have any bears (those are far further north), no wolves or coywolves, and our coyotes are rather small and very shy. As are the deer. I even contacted our local DFW and they said there was nothing bigger than coyote and deer out here. 

I take the dogs out into the yard to pee 2-3 times after dark. I put them on a split leash and normally wander around the yard for a bit to let them find a spot, but that has come to an end. I don’t dare step off the patio now. 

For the past few weeks, my dogs have been acting really odd when it comes to going out at night. They want to go out front, but since my landlord doesn’t want me to let them ruin the front lawn I have to drag them to the backdoor. And they refuse to step out most times, especially my younger dog. They want to stay close to the house, and are always VERY alert. 
They will lunge towards the woods at random, starting to bark like crazy. I would normally call this off as wildlife, but it’s been getting really weird. And normally if there is something like a rabbit, they are very easily shushed and redirected. 

I’ve heard whatever it is walking, right at the edge of the woods. It doesn’t have the typical 4-beat walk of a 4 legged animal, and it is not scared of my dogs. I can hear it’s heavy by the way the leaves scrunch and the branches crack. It is not scared of the dogs, or me shouting, and it does not leave. If it’s there at 9 pm, it’ll be there at midnight, and it’ll be there at 2am. Always at the edge of the woods. And I can feel a difference myself, too. Even when I go out alone (I had to grab a patio chair the other day, for example) it’s almost like I can feel when it’s there. I’m normally very relaxed in my yard, even at night. But I’ll get that backshuddering, heartracing get-in-get-in-get-in feeling. 

My dogs will even go crazy when inside, seemingly at random. Standing at the windows barking out to the woods. 

I’ve been out there during the day, looking for things like fur scraps, scat, stag, or clawmarks, etc. Nothing turned up. Not even footsteps (thought it would have been a person, perhaps)

I’m trying really hard to find a reasonable excuse for what might have been happening. But I keep running into dead ends. 

I’m an immigrant, I’m not too knowledgeable on the local stuff... “folklore” or whatever you wanna call it. But holy hell this scares the life out of me. 

So I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight. 
Whatever it is... how can I appease it? Or make it leave me alone? 
Or is there anything else I can do?"
t3_fbs4b0,all_ads,I’ve had some weird things happen to me: Spirits,Thetruthishere,"Hey it’s me again ya boy with the weird dreams and run-on sentences. I’m visiting home for the weekend and now that I’m back in my childhood room I’m having a lot of things come back to me. 

As a kid I often called for my parents in the night because I wasn’t afraid of the dark I was afraid of what was in the dark specifically in my closet. As normal and cliche as it is I always felt much safer when the doors were closed. However there would be times when if I slept with my back facing my room and doorway I’d get the feeling and mental image of a large figure either coming from beneath my bed or materializing in my room and running its fingers down my back. 

There were two forms it takes one is a woman and I can’t tell if she’s young or old but she seems sad and angry. I think she lost her child though because her touch, as frightening as it was, tended to be more gentle though I could feel the rage in her. She tended to materialize more in the room. The second is far bigger and its touch more frightening. It is this giant figure draped in seaweed or rags or something. Like a mummy but not all stiff and decomposing. It seems more remorseful but still has something horrific behind it. 

They don’t seem to be very active now and since I’m much older I haven’t seemed to be in tune with them much. My odd theory is they’re somehow connected possibly they lost a child or were together and suffered. I also felt things in my dad’s office, the living room, and the guest bathroom. My parents have been in this house for nearly 30 years and haven’t really had anything odd happen to them in that time and as far as I know there isn’t anything that happened in the house before them or to the land it’s built on. Maybe they’re attached to the house or maybe they’re attached to me but at college they can’t manifest as easily cause of my current state or the sheer number of people around me. 

Do any of you have spirits that were with you when you were young? Or you’ve found at any point in your life that are recurring?"
t3_fbdupg,all_ads,My encounter with Robert the Doll,Thetruthishere,"This is my written encounter with Robert the Doll.

Detailed as follows is the meeting and later encounter with the spirit or entity attached to the doll. Then an explanation of any bad luck that has happened.

Everything that happened is real. I experienced it while awake. I was on no substances that could cause a hallucination and have never partaken in anything that would be considered a drug or illegal substance. You choose what you believe but my eyes saw what they saw and I heard what I heard. 

I went on vacation with my family to Key West a few years ago. We decided to go to the museum to visit and I honestly did want to go see Robert in person because I had read about him before. I took a picture at one point that had him in the background. It was not a direct picture in front of him. This was enough to get his attention though but I did delete the picture later and it no longer exists. 

When he visited me (this means the entity moved from the doll) I heard laughing and turned on the light to see the metal pull cord to the fan (it was on but I had never seen it move the chain prior to this) spinning around like someone had pulled it or was messing around with it. This was the extent of any interaction I have had with the entity away from the doll itself. Nothing happened while I was at the museum or during the day up to this point. 

Since taking the picture and the visit I have not had anything that I would call unfortunate or terrible in a life-ruining way. I have a nice job that I like now and life has been normal. I think there is a chance Robert may know when someone makes a mistake or is intentionally going up and taking his picture with full knowledge of what they are doing. Basically, if you play with fire, in this case, you will probably get burned. 

I’m willing to answer any questions to my best ability."
t3_fboaad,all_ads,Ghosts in my house,Thetruthishere,"Recently I’ve been experiencing things happening in my house that are really weird. My dog died recently and yet when I’m up around 2am I can hear his footsteps coming to the same location over and over. One time it was 1 am and for 3 seconds a random person appeared and vanished in front of my door. He was crouching on the floor and didn’t make any sound. On another day I heard someone call my name in a soft voice. The voice in my house that called my name used my real name which is weird since everyone in my life has called me by my nickname. The only person who didn’t know about my nickname is my grandma but she died when I was eight, in the same house I currently live in. I dunno what to do. I got nowhere where to go. So I guess I’ll have to sit through it and see what happens."
t3_fbglh4,all_ads,Weird things happen in New Mexico,Thetruthishere,"When I was 10 my family and I went to New Mexico to visit relatives. It was February and freezing. We were staying at my aunts house, a small bungalow. Me and my family, my mom, dad, and sister, were sleeping in the loft. It was just one room with a full size mattress on the floor which my parents slept in and me and my sister slept on the floor in sleeping bags. The hole time we were there I felt like I was in a dream. When we went out to town it was normal I felt real but whenever we went back to that house I felt like I was watching a movie. Like i was there but at the same time I wasn’t. 
      
I was never a big believer in the supernatural as a kid but this changed my outlook forever. I still dont have a definitive side i stand on but i question everything now. Just to give some backstory I don’t remember much from when I was younger and most of the memories I do have are choppy and faded but this i remember clear as day. As far as my dreams go i dont have nightmares like ever and even if i do there weird pointless ones that aren’t scary but just have a feeling of fear if the makes sense. All my dreams are weird they never make any sense, like how you feel on shrooms, those are my dreams. 
   
When i went to bed that night i fell asleep pretty easily which doesn’t happen often. Okay now for the actual dream. I was in the backyard on the hill that was covered in snow. A young girl somewhere from the age of 9-11 was standing in front of me. She was wearing a long white night gown, she was pale, not unnaturally pale just very white i guess, almost glowing, she had dirty blonde hair and blue eyes, she had freckles but not all over her face only faintly spread from her cheeks to her forehead. She didn’t have shoes which i found strange until i realized she wasn’t touching the ground. She was hovering an inch or so above. 
   
She reached out her hand motioning me to follow her so i did. As we walked up the snowy hill to the edge of the woods i noticed footprints in the snow just one set leading into the woods but none coming out. They were big bootprints probably a mens 12 or so boot. When i looked at the footprints for a brief second i could see the man that made them. He was around 6’2 and stocky, he had a chubby face, a beard and a button nose, he was wearing a black beanie and a thick winter flannel type jacket, maybe wool? with a button up and a long sleeve underneath, he had old worn jeans on and construction type boots. I only saw him for a second but it felt like forever. The weird thing was i couldn’t see his eyes they were there i just couldn’t focus on them. 
  
Then we got to the edge of the woods and the girl looked at me and continued to go deeper into the woods. We were only walking for a second but i look around and i couldn’t see the edge of the trees anymore when i turn around we are in a small clearing in the middle of the woods about the size of a small bathroom if that make sense. There are these huge logs in the shape of a rectangle that the girl is walking on (more like hovering on) and there are these white fairy lights strung up on the trees also in the shape of a rectangle. I climb up on the logs and look at the girl, she looks down into the middle of them and goes from a happy little girl to sad almost like despair, i followed where here eyes went. It had to be like a 4 foot drop to the ground where there was fresh dirt, no snow like someone had just covered in a hole. I look up at her and she looks at me with sadness in her eyes and i feel dreadful i look back down at the ground and theres a hole, about 5 feet long and 3 feet wide i couldn’t tell how deep it was but when i finally focused on the bottom there was what look to be a body wrapped in that clear plastic tarp stuff you put on the floor when your painting a room. I felt like my heart had fell to my stomach and the dread starts to become overwhelming. 
  
I wake up in the loft covered in sweat even though the room was freezing. I check the clock and its 4 am everyone else is sound asleep. I didn’t go back to sleep after that i just stayed up trying to think about anything else except what just happened. I never talked about until i was around 14 me and my mom were talking about how we had a lot of fun there and how we’d like to go back. We had just pull in the driveway and we were sitting in the car. I dont know why but i felt like i needed to tell her about the dream so i did i started crying and before i could finish the rest of the dream she finished it for me. She said she had the same one. That freaked me out even more. I’m 17 now and haven’t had a dream that vivd since. I have only told that story twice(to my mom and my best friend) and both times i’ve broken down into tears trying to get through it. I dont mean to cry i just feel so overwhelmed its hard to think. Im crying right now. I feel like it sounds so made up but its not. I swear on my life this was one of the scariest experiences i’ve ever had. I dont know what that dream meant or why it felt so real but i think there might be a little girl buried in the woods in Taos, New Mexico."
t3_fbkj31,all_ads,"Please help: going to confront my literal childhood ""demons"". What should I know?",Thetruthishere,"Well, after a long life of just shrugging off what happened during my childhood I've finally decided to make some sense of it.  My childhood home is back on the market again.. not surprising. I've been drawn to it the past year and finally, it's open and empty again. My brother and I experienced awful things in this home. We did live directly across the street from a ""graveyard"". Quotes are there because only two children are buried there. However during my investigation into my childhood home, I found the city did a subsurface investigation and found additional four unidentified adult graves in the same vicinity. About 10/20 feet from my home. However, there is also something demonic that follows my mother. Whom we lived with during our tenure there. With all that being said, my childhood was traumatic. Due to those things and my oldest (not the one previously mentioned) brother raped me for years. So I'm going back. I'm going back into the home to wash myself of the entities that I feel may have followed me. But more importantly, for answers. I was originally going to smudge the home but I've decided to ask some questions as to why it wanted to harm my middle brother so much and what it wanted from us and to disconnect from us as we all suffer still. How do I protect myself? I can't afford to bring a team in and I also don't own the home, my grandma does. What do I ask them? Should I ask and investigate one day and then smudge another or both in one night? Any advice is welcome. I'm tired of having nightmares of this place, it's time to disconnect."
t3_fbn3mn,all_ads,Update/new ghost along the railbed,Thetruthishere,This is kinda a update new thing that has been happening. I posted here a couple of weeks ago that I herd a ghost telegraph operator along the Old railroad bed that I live by. Well I still haven't herd it again but I am still hearing looking into it. As for the new well I've been seeing a red ball of light further down the line. I know that way back in the 50s or 60s there was a wreak at the bridge that's like maybe 1000 yards away. So my question can these two things be connected. Like the operator sending a message not to come and the light being the ghost of the flagmen warning other trains not to come? Or could this all just be something else?

t3_fbbj5z,all_ads,"Temporal Divergence or Time Travel, MIB &amp; The Mandela Effect",Thetruthishere,"(The makers of this site put up a security block which also makes me think its for real. Like why discourage people from visiting the site?. So to visit the site you may need to scroll down to the security warning page to advanced options and click I understand risks and continue to page.)

You may need to know this to understand better. In chronos's findings time travel or temporal divergence as they call it is when someone travels into a parallel reality because you can not travel into your own past merely a similar parallel reality. If one opens a portal into a divergent timeline once the portal is closed the link is lost forever.


Recently I found this [site](http://www.chronos.ws) about time travel that states at the bottom for ""entertainment"" purposes only, but I find it makes to much sence to be just that. In particular the part on navigating timelines. Where it tells you how more advanced time travelers could enter our time line and secretly control events/history while none would be the wiser. I believe people from Orion star system threw the MIB have been doing just that. Well up until we discovered time travel and weeded them out of our timeline. This would have uimaginable gains and resources. The site also goes into how one would do that. 

I believe this would also make sense out of the Mandela Effect. 1.On this site it states that when a time traveler enters a divergent timeline or parrallel reality that there mere presence would have huge effects, not right away if they avoided making changes, but long term the future would look nothing like the future of the original timeline. This is explained on the site aswell. I'll touch on that, it's because there atoms and what makes up people or what ever else they bring into our timeline was never in that timeline, so by adding atoms and particles to a timeline it has drastic effects because of destiny and the law of causality.

1.Excerpt from site,
While some events, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die, may seem to be random, their outcomes are determined by the forces of nature. This can be illustrated by tracing the contributing causal forces of an event backwards in time:

When a coin is flipped, it lands tails-up. This is due not to random chance, but to forces acting on the coin, including air density and wind, local gravitational forces, the force and trajectory at which the coin was thrown, and the weight of the coin itself. While these and other factors may seem to be random and spontaneous, each force acting on the coin was in turn caused by another force. For example, the force with which the coin was thrown was determined by the neuro-muscular development of the person throwing it, which in turn was determined by the person's experience, diet, environment, and genetic makeup. The person's genetic makeup was determined by which genes were passed on from the parents, which were determined by when the parents conceived the child, which was determined by when the parents first met, which was determined by the geographic locations of the parents, which could be traced back through economic, political, geological, and evolutionary causal forces, which in turn can be traced back to the creation of Earth and the Solar system, which in turn was determined by the forces existing at the creation of the Universe. 

I'm confident this explains the Mandela effect because if time travelers entered our timeline there mere presence would change events. I still have my memories of my past, but my future from the point they entered my timeline would change leading to these changes we are seeing. (I have seen myself) The flip flop aspect could be explained by; If other time travelers (beside's Orion) from other star systems enter our reality there presence from the point they enter our reality after Orion did would have long term affects changing events again.

Update:
 I found proof to back up my claim that this site is not that of entertainment purposes. I did a FOIA (freedom of information act) search on Chronos Technologies .inc the company that made this site. I found some very interesting things to say the least. The person that owns this companie Randall B.  Olsen also works for the United States Government in technology department and is responsible for a ton of technology advancements in our society and especially for space and space exploration. This would make sense that he developed technology that allowed temporal divergence. I've only scratched the surface (just started the research) and will report back when I have more.

Also I've found patients and other projects Chronos Technologies Inc. worked on using their developed technology.
Here is one such company they develope tech for.

t3_fb4sis,all_ads,Scary night alone in my apartment,Thetruthishere,"So after work one night, I was sitting in my kitchen and I started to hear this music.. I didn’t think much of it at first because I would leave the radio on for my dog. I got up to check it out and as soon as I got to the hallway I stopped hearing it.. checked the radio in the bathroom, nothing. Went to sat back down and I was hearing it again. I could make out each instrument and hear fuzzy vocals. I got back up and out of my corner of my eye I saw this large dark shadowy figure in the hallway I had just come from before when I checked the radio. I was done, I thought to myself I must be crazy.. it’s time for bed. I go upstairs to my bedroom and get safely under my covers. Except I didn’t feel alone. It truly felt like someone was right there with me in that room. I thought.. nbd, it’s my dog.. I called his name and he came running up the stairs. Okayyy. Officially freaked out at this point, I get under the covers almost completely. And then, I shit you not, I felt a poke on the top of my head. On the only part of my body sticking out of my blankets. It wasn’t a soft tap or ANYTHING I felt like I could explain, it straight up felt like someone poked me with their index finger on the top of my head. I’m not sure how I managed to get myself to sleep, but I was definitely alllll the way under my blankets when I did. 

I have only shared this experience with a couple of friends and my psychiatrist. Psych said the event happened because of “steroid psychosis”. I was on antidepressants prescribed from him, but I got into a car accident that messed up my hearing from the airbag so an ENT doctor prescribed me Prednisone. Not sure what happened, but it was terrifying and I moved out a month later anyway."

t3_fbh13z,all_ads,Glowing ball of light,Thetruthishere,"I have never known what to make of what i am about to tell you. It was the strangest thing i have ever seen besides one other experience that i will tell in another post. Back in 2014 i went to a fireworks show on the fourth of july. Me and a guy i was dating were sitting down on the grass and the show was about to begin. We decided to get up and go smoke a joint behind the school where the fireworks were being held. I used to smoke weed everday years before but at the time i only smoked maybe once or twice a month. I am high but not crazy high i only hit the joint a few times and feel relaxed. After we smoke we go back to where all the other people are and the fireworks begin. After about 10 minutes the weirdest thing happens. There is this glowing ball of light that is far off in the distance. At first im thinking it is just a part of the firework but then this ball keeps getting closer. I ask the guy im with if he sees it and he does. At this point im intrigued and have never seen anything like this before and ive been going to see fireworks my entire life. I keep staring at the bright white glowing ball of what kind looks like fire but kind of doesnt. Its so hard to explain exactly what it looks like. Well it keeps getting closer and now it looks like its only 100 feet away. I am scared now and start closing my eyes because i dont know what i am seeing. I am wondering if it is because i am hallucinating from the weed. The guy i am with keeps saying what is that ive never seen anything like that. I turn my back on the ball of light bc im too scared to look at it and start asking people around me if they see it. They say yes they see it and im asking what is it and they dont know. Im thinking ok it isnt the weed this thing is real and what if it hurts us. I turn back around and it is super close and when i look at it its like im looking at it through 3D glasses. I can tell its like 30 feet away but at the same time it looks like it is right in front of my face. I ended up running back to the car and leaving. The guy i was with just kept saying how strange what we saw was and how everyone in the crowd looked mesmerized by it when we were leaving. I was in shock and really scared. I didnt understand what it was i just saw and to this day i still dont know what it was. I have googled it and the only thing that made any sense was this one paranormal website that described glowing balls of fire that people have seen but have never been caught on camera. I have never forgotten what happened that fourth of july and my mind wants to rationalize it and tell me that i was just high and hallucinating but i have smoked thousands of times in my life and nothing like that ever happened. Plus, other people saw it. About two weeks before this i witnessed a strange formation of what i think were ufos in the sky that were traveling super fast and would change formation but i am going to write another post with that full story. I think my reaction to the glowing ball was even more intense because of that situation. After these two experiences i didnt ever see anything strange again. I am really curious to hear if anyone else has experienced something like this or has any explanations."

Apologies for formatting also as I’m on my phone!



When I was younger, in my old house before we moved, I was terrified of the upstairs of my house for as long as I can remember. I can’t say when it started as it feels like it’s part of my earliest memories, we moved into the house when I was 2 and I believe it started pretty early on. This fear did not go away until I was 10, this is when we moved to a new house and all this fear that I had my whole life just vanished. I am almost 22 now and this fear has never returned in any house or situation so I believe it is tied to that house or something that happened there. 

When I say terrified I mean I could not be up there alone right up until we moved. We only had one bathroom which meant I used to hold it until someone would come with me. It became a chore for my mum and sister who had to come with me. If nobody came I just wouldn’t go until they did (I can hold for a long time and I wonder if this is why). When this happened at night, I would either wake up my sister who I shared a room with, or I would shout for my mum. This would sometimes go on for upwards of an hour. At times my sister just refused to get up as I can imagine it was frustrating and eventually she was just able to sleep through it. My mum would always wake up at some point and when she did she would take me to the toilet, which was literally outside of my room, and go back to sleep. I used to throw up a lot as a child and would often throw up on the end of my bed because I was just too afraid to leave my room and be in the bathroom alone and there was no time to wake my mum or sister. I know that’s absolutely disgusting but being alone in any room upstairs just wasn’t an option for me. This was just our normal at the time. For some reason the room I absolutely hated was my mums room. It had this dark feeling every time I peeked inside and most of the time I’d just walk past it as quickly as I could and avoid going in there. 

My mum has told me briefly about me seeing a dog at the end of my bed when I was younger even though we didn’t have a dog. I also vaguely remember thinking there was a boy crying in the bathtub. I don’t personally think these experiences are evidence of the paranormal but they are strange. I also vividly remember some very traumatising nightmares that I believe could have been sleep paralysis as I get it often now. I was very young at the time of some of these dreams and looking back I don’t think they are normal for a 5 year old. I had recurring dreams of someone calling me from downstairs imitating my mum, I knew it wasn’t her as it felt evil so I’d just ignore it and let them call until the morning. I also had frequent horrific nightmares of my family being brutally murdered or attacked and they always ended with me dying too. I could feel the pain in the dream and it always felt like I woke up once I had died. 

A couple of dreams I had were just everyday things with my family that I genuinely believed to be memories until I brought them up a couple years ago and my family had no idea what I was talking about. There are also a few gaps in my childhood memories for seemingly no reason. 

I have spoken about this to a few people and while the dreams are creepy, I still frequently have nightmares like that and I do believe it is just my brain, some have suggested the paranormal though. But the fear of being alone upstairs that carried on until I was 10 just weirds me out. It was such a big part of my life. My family and I were all shocked when we moved and I was absolutely fine with my own room and going upstairs alone. I am considering regression therapy as I believe something might have happened to cause this that I might have blocked out as a child but still kept the fear? 

However, I don’t know much about these things and I really don’t know if it’s worth going through regression therapy for something that could be paranormal or nothing? If anyone knows a little more about these kind of things and regression therapy I’d love to hear it. I don’t know why but I have a strong feeling that something paranormal had scared me at a young age. I’ve always wanted to know what it was that scared me so much.


EDIT: I’d also like to mention that whenever people tried to get me to go upstairs alone, or if I was ever left upstairs alone, I would literally start hyperventilating and having a massive panic attack. This was only ever in that house and it was only me, my mum and my sister living there. 

Furthermore, someone had died in that house before. I’m not sure what room, but I’m also not sure that it was just a simple ghost that was causing the fear. I’ve never felt fear like it since, hence why I believe it’s either childhood trauma or something malevolent. It really felt like something horrible was up there. Like I was being watched."
t3_fb6vpo,all_ads,Ghost?,Thetruthishere,"I’ve never posted on here before and I’m honestly not sure how to even start this (I also hope this is a good place to post it lol). But something happened to me when I was about 14 that has left me with a genuine fear of closet’s and relaxing alone with my bedroom door open.

I’ll start with a little backstory. When I was 11 I moved from my childhood home in a bigger, slightly newer home. It was big and a lot more spacious than my old house, so I was excited. But the night we moved in there something about the house didn’t feel right? It just felt the need to constantly look over my shoulder. Nothing actually happened, just weird feelings.

Even after settling in nothing really happened? Other than feeling the constant need to look over my shoulder and occasionally seeing shadows out the corner of my eye.

It wasn’t until I was 14 that something happened and seemed to be the start of weird occurrences?

One morning, I “woke” up (I put it in quotations because never actually opened my eyes), and almost immediately decided to go back to sleep. I feel like it’s important to note that I wasn’t stuck, I could have opened my eyes if I wanted to, but I just didn’t.

As I was laying there, I tried to make myself comfy, so I moved my left arm and hand out from underneath the covers to rest on my side (I was laying on my right side with my back facing my open bedroom door). And as I lay there I began to hear what sounded like someone dragging their feet across the carpet. I wasn’t worried at this point bc my room was at the very end of the hall, and the bathroom was right before it, so I figured someone was going to the bathroom.

But they passed the bathroom and walked right into my room and opened my closet (my closet door creaked really bad when someone would open it). I still rationalized it in my mind as my mom, as she would put my clothes away for me. But then, the shuffling started up again and the walked back towards the door, but they didn’t leave, they stopped and I suddenly felt an ice cold, wrinkled hand grab mine, not threateningly, just a nice hold (think of when friends hold hands lol) and like any normal person I got scared as fuck.

So I tensed up, but was too scared to open my eyes. I tried to tell myself that it was my grandma (who lived with us) and she had finally lost her damn mind. The hand suddenly started rubbing circles with it’s thumb on my hand. For some reason I start to relax bc I convinced myself that it was grandma who had finally lost it.

But as soon as I relaxed the grip went from light to almost crushing? and the things nails felt like claws digging into my hand? The hand yanked me, like it was trying to move me. And that’s when I finally opened my eyes and sat up, but there was nothing there? I can’t remember if my closet door was shut completely or not, but I do remember that it wasn’t wide open like it should have been.

It was weird and I was terrified. I looked at my hand, and started rubbing it. It looked normal, no finger marks or anything (I’m very pale, so squeezing my hand like that would have been noticeable for at least a second or two), it just had little indents where the nails would have been?

I obviously got the fuck out my room after I saw the little marks, but I never actually told anyone until after we moved out the house. It scared me to think about then, and even talking about it now is setting off my anxiety.

I’m sorry this is so long, and I hope you guys actually take me seriously. I tried to sound as “adult” as possible while telling this. This happened about 7 years ago now and has left me with a lot of serious, but at the same time, very silly fears. 

I just wanted honest opinions as to whether this might have been a ghost or not. I don’t believe it was a sleep paralysis, as I wasn’t stuck, but I also don’t know too much about sleep paralysis, so maybe it was and I’m just overreacting? Idk."
t3_fatkb5,all_ads,No one cares if you believe it or not,Thetruthishere,"So I’ve been in this subreddit for a while and I’ve enjoyed reading every single post here, and I find it really fun to read others theories and suspicions. But I can’t take it when someone comments “not true” or “I don’t believe this” or things like that. I mean that’s the point of the this subreddit, these stories aren’t meant to be be normal or believable, so why not just enjoy it instead of debating it?"
t3_faxyf1,all_ads,House from Hell,Thetruthishere,"I recently posted here about a past experience with a shadow entity and somebody was interested in some of my other stories, so this is my experience living in a very active house about 5 years ago. Sorry for the long post, there were many creepy occurrences there.

Just after graduation my family moved into a house previously owned by my great grandmother. There were 5 of us at first: my parents and I, my friend K, and my boyfriend (now husband) who had moved in due to not wanting to move out of state with his family.

The House had it odd layout, as it had been a mobile home that had an add on in the front (living room) and the back (master bedroom). Bf had a room on one end of the house, K &amp; I shared a room on the other end, the kitchen was in the middle. To get to the main bathroom you would have to go through the room that K &amp; I shared.

It started with little things, weird feelings, moved objects, the sound of furniture being dragged and moved, most notably the bathroom door. We started keeping it shut at night, otherwise it would open and close on its own. It did this all the time, day or night. We checked for drafts and anything that could cause it and found nothing. We began to notice that anytime it started to move, if we got irritated and told it to stop the door would immediately cease to move. One night we hadn’t been in bed long when K got up to use the bathroom. I heard her leave the bathroom without closing the door and I told her to close it because it bothered me. I heard the long creak of the door as it slowly shut, but didn’t quite click into place. I irritability told her to shut it all the way, when she responded “that wasn’t me...” in a horrified tone from the opposite corner of the room. I turned the light on and the door was completely shut, just not clicked into the frame. I ripped the door open and nothing was there. We were completely freaked out. I slammed the door and told her that is why I keep the door shut.

There was also the knocking. We had 3 doors on the house leading outside. Pretty frequently we would here 3 knocks on any of the doors. I always look out the window before opening the door if we’re not expecting any guests because you never know who might be there, so I would check the window and nobody would be there. I was once standing in front of the back door when this happened and I could clearly see through the window on the door that nobody was there, but the door was shaking as it was hit. 

My bf started having vivid nightmares of something trying to drag him from his bed. Later my mother’s friend was over with her toddler and he was exploring like a normal kid his age. He stopped in the doorway to my bfs room and stared for a while. He then came back and started saying “ghost” and pointing at my bfs room. Nobody had mentioned anything remotely related to a ghost or scary story and this was nowhere near Halloween either. We tried to brush it off, but he was insistent. We tried to ask for details but he would only say “go see” and “ghost”. I followed him back to the room and he pointed at the small game closet and insisted “ghost!” “Go see!”. I opened the door for him and nothing was there, but he insisted there was a ghost.

The worst night we spent in the house was when we had been in bed for about 45 minutes when suddenly something slammed into the bed with enough force to shake the whole mattress. My bed frame didn’t fit in the small room, so the mattress was on the box spring on the floor. Both K &amp; I felt it. We turned the light on and there was nothing so we got as far from the edges of the bed as possible and tried to sleep. Something grabbed Ks foot and yanked her blanket away. Once again the light revealed nothing and we were terrified. Something slammed into the wall next to the other side of the bed. These things continued into the night and we ended up sleeping in the living room with my dad staying with us.

My parents eventually moved out after a few months into the house they were working on and left us the hell house. K &amp; I moved into the master room and made our old room the area where we kept our 2 new puppies kennels. On 3 occasions my 8 month old pit would walk into that room, throw himself on the floor with all of his hair standing on end, and scream and growl while fixated on the upper corner of the room. When he would do this I would have to physically drag him from the room and shut the door to calm him. The other dog would somehow get out of a locked kennel when he was left in there alone and the kennel would still be locked and secure, we still have no idea how he did it.

K and my mother started hearing voices when they were there alone and the uncomfortable feeling got worse. One night something started clawing at our bedroom door and we we so freaked out by it that I called my bf to come look at the door from the other side because I was too scared to unlock and open it.

The House got 5 ft of water in it during hurricane Harvey and we tore it down and moved. I never felt upset over losing the house, I was just relieved to be rid of it and hoped that the flood took whatever was there with it.

Sorry for the long post, if I think of anything else I might add it in an edit.

EDIT: We did attempt to catch something on video one night. We set up a new video camera with a full battery in our room before bed and left the bathroom light on because the camera didn’t do night vision. When I checked it in the morning there was only about half an hour of video before the camera apparently died. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but later on I realized that something must have drained the battery."

t3_fb1xhf,all_ads,I've felt something odd in my chest during intensely spiritual moments.,Thetruthishere,"Right up front, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this story, so if it isn't please forgive me. I read a few of the posts here and was reminded of this particular experience of mine.

A brief background: I was raised Catholic. I don't feel as close to the Church as I used to but I do consider myself religious/spiritual. After 3rd grade, my parents started sending me to Catholic schools, and I was baptized and confirmed in the faith.

A few times in my life, I've had a strange sensation manifest itself during moments that were very spiritually significant in some way. It's not a very flashy story, but it's one of those things that kinda affirms my belief in God. I know it's happened multiple times but I can only recall one specific instance. 

During a church retreat I went on as a part of Confirmation, I was a part of a meditation of sorts. In actuality, it was just kind of a ""let's calm down and think about God"" moment. We were in a chapel, myself, a handful of other teenagers, and our adult group leader. We were lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling.

The leader led us through a meditation, talking us through a reflection on God. While we were lying there, just thinking about God, I felt something weird in my chest. It felt like hot water was being poured into my heart. 

To elaborate, imagine the sensation of the first sip of a warm drink going down your throat. Imagine feeling the warmth of that drink as it travels to your stomach. Now, imagine that feeling a little farther forward in your chest than your throat. Imagine it where your heart is, right behind your ribs, nestled between your lungs. That's what I felt.

That was the first time I felt it, but I have felt it multiple times since, all during intimate religious moments. I don't really have any way to prove this in anyway, considering this was just a sensation I felt in my chest, but that's my story.

What do you guys think?"
t3_fb3gdi,all_ads,Shared dreams?,Thetruthishere,"

I’ve come across this subreddit recently and after reading multiple stories it had me remembering something strange that happened to my sister and I when we were younger. Just for context, at the moment she is 27 and I (male) am 23. 

When I was around 7-10 years old I would have this reoccurring dream where my sister and I are in my dads truck, she was always the driver and I was always the passenger. This dream always took place on the same part of the street where I could see our mailbox through the lower left side of the front windshield. For whatever reason the same thing would always happen in the dream, the truck would start up and take off by itself and neither of us could control it or make it stop. It would always end up crashing which would startle me and wake me up in the middle of the night. 
I never really thought much of this dream at the time, just brushed it off as you would after any weird dream, I did however find it a bit odd that I had had the same specific dream like 9-10 times. 

Anyways a couple years later when I was around 13 I was watching tv with my dad and 3 sisters. We were watching a show that I guess was people telling stories of weird dreams they had. Intrigued by the idea, this sparked up a conversation within my family and we started sharing the weird dreams we experienced. Most of them were what you’d expect, stories of being able to fly or having superpowers etc. nothing out of the ordinary. Then (the specific sister who was always in my dream) started talking about her dreams. She started by saying that a couple of years before, she had a reoccurring dream where her and I were in my dads truck. She then went on to explain the dream EXACTLY how I had them, down to what seemed like the smallest detail. Her always being the driver me always being the passenger the truck parked in the same spot I saw it with the mailbox in the same view as mine. How the dream started and how the dream ended. 
Obviously I was very shocked. I felt almost speechless as she was telling it but after she was done I tried explaining to everyone that I had the EXACT same reoccurring dream. Of course everyone thought I was joking, including her. I was pretty frustrated because no one would believe me so I just gave it up and moved on. 
A couple days later I went up to her and told her again that I was serious and that I was freaking out because I had the exact same dream. We then spoke about it for awhile and shared details of what we remember. Our 2 dreams seemed to match up perfectly with other smaller details matching that I won’t bother writing about here in fear of this being too long. 
This really freaked us both out. Neither of us had a good explanation for this. We’re a family of 5 kids (3 girls 2 boys) but as it pertained to this specific dream I had always dreamt her and she had always dreamt me. We decided that when we have the dream again we’ll tell each other the next day but ever since that conversation neither of us have had the dream again. 

I know this story isn’t as crazy as a lot of the other ones on this subreddit but it always freaks me out when I think about it. Have any of you had any similar experiences with a sibling? I would love to hear your stories."
t3_fb4bam,all_ads,A Ghost or just a deer.,Thetruthishere,This happened back when I was a senior in high school. I used to live in a around a 100 year old farm house. The house was up on a hill and below there is the Old cattle barn. And across the street there is a cemetery that dates back to the founding of the town that I live in (around the late 1840s). So one night three friends and I are chilling around a apple tree that's behind my house. They are all talking and I am standing there looking down at the cattle barn and in the light there's a white around I would say 5' tall white figure walking up the hill. So I say hay look at that and we all just start running back to the front of the house. After we all got are stuff back together me and my one friend went back and saw it along the wood line it the back. Later that night I would say around 1 in the morning the same friend and I were on the porch and both of us saw two black figures join into one and disappear. To this day we as a group don't know what we saw that night (I have a theory about it but could never prove it) but it was one of the scariest/coolest things I've ever had.
t3_fawzui,all_ads,School grim reaper ?,Thetruthishere,"This is my first story which is true. I’m not a writer so I’m sorry for the improper grammar as well I’m writing this on my phone . I will never forget what I saw I’m 25 now this was back in 2003 was in third grade. We were taking a test and when I was finished I got up to ask my teacher if I can use the restroom he then said I’d don’t know if you can but you may use the restroom. Me being a third grader was like ok can I go or not lol. So I usually never liked going to the restroom during class because well I’ve always been afraid of the dark or going to restrooms with a bunch of stalls  alone it just freaks me out. Anyway I remember i had to pee so bad so I went to the restroom which was on a hallway down from the classroom I was in. This was morning time maybe 10 or so. The restroom when you walk in the door is a wall straight ahead a short wall to cover the stalls then to the left is the mirrors and once you wrap around the little wall the stalls on the right and sinks on the left. I don’t know if I’m explaining well but the sinks don’t have the mirrors above them. There are about 5 stalls so imagine a pretty decent length in the restroom. Well I go about my business then wash my hands being the girly girl I was I took my time to look in the mirror and that’s when I saw someone sitting at the end of the last stall in a black coat with a hood you couldn’t see a face since they were slouched over and their hood was covering their face I  couldn’t see it’s arms either since the coat was like the one of how they show in movies or cartoon of the grim reaper as best as I can describe sorry . I turn around and saw nothing thinking I’m imagining things I look back in the mirror is when it had an arm that was nothing but a skeleton arm showing that it was not a person. That when I didn’t look back and ran out of that restroom. I never told anyone when I got back to class because didn’t think people would believe a child since every knew I’m afraid of the dark. I never saw it again I don’t know what it was but I know I wasn’t dreaming.
I have a few other weird things Ive seen, if this gets good reviews I will be happy to share more."
t3_fazzlu,all_ads,Dream fortelling death?,Thetruthishere,"I lost my mom about 1.5 years ago. After she passed I have had several dreams that were very vivid. The occurrences of these dreams are less frequent now. A few months after she had passed I had one such vivid dream where I saw her, my dad, and a close family friend (originally my dads friend from back in school) sitting at a table. In my dream we were casually talking about stuff. My mom mentioned her own funeral activities  and said she was glad that everything went without a hitch. Then she reached her hand out to our family friend and touched his face and the dream ended there. I woke up right after the dream wondering how odd the dream was and even odder that this family friend was so randomly placed in that dream and what did that gesture from my mom even mean? I even remembered thinking to myself if she was indicating that he would be the next one to pass away?? Anyways fast forward to today I get a call from my dad. He mentioned that the family friend had a stroke two days ago and he passed today. I feel quite bizarre. Am I reading too much into my dream? A medium on this subreddit said spirits can not necessarily see the future.. so this couldn’t have been a message from my mother? Anyone else with such experience?"
t3_fatdoi,all_ads,There is something that follows me everywhere I go,Thetruthishere,"Every night going to sleep throughout my life I have felt like I wasn't alone. I would see and hear things in the dark, often feeling something as well. I always just brushed it off as something from my dreams, or a really vivid imagination.

It started in my old house, when I was very little. I would often feel the presence of something around me. Stalking me. And when going up the stairs next to a huge window I felt scared, like it could come out at any point.

It was definitely a hostile feeling. I always felt like I was being hunted. And one night I felt it in the house. I was terrified of the bathroom in front of my room. Not anywhere else. Not the creepy basement door to nowhere, not the dark corridor, not the empty room next to me that creaked. The bathroom. I felt like it was watching me.

After a couple of years we finally moved, but I didn't stop feeling whatever ""it"" is. I felt like it was in my room now. Watching from the corners. Making noises sometimes.

Then I moved again, and that was the most stressful and horrible couple of years of my life. I was really depressed. Sometimes when I felt the presence I started talking to it. Venting my frustrations and asking it to please go away and leave me be. It never really worked.

But I felt things change a little. I felt like the hostility was somewhat disappearing. And even though I was still creeped out, I didn't feel afraid anymore.

And recently things have changed quite a bit too. I tried talking to it sometimes, trying to get any confirmation it was actually there, and not just something my mind came up with all these years.

I started confiding some personal information with it, talking about some of my fears and anxieties.

A couple of days ago I lost my guitar pick. I couldn't find it anywhere. Looked everywhere I could and didn't find it at all. So I asked for it out loud. I said, to my seemingly empty room ""could you please give back my pick? It's important to me"".

Some days later, while I'm alone, I'm at my desk, writing and drawing. My pencil falls and I have to get up to get it. When I'm back there it is. The guitar pick just one top of my desk, as if nothing had ever happened. I thanked whatever it is who is in my room and went about my day.

Now I don't feel the hostility at all. But it's definitely still not friendly. I think I might be gaining its trust in a way. Earning it's friendship.

I have also been feeling its presence outside of my home as well. Keeping me from feeling lonely. When on my room, I think it might be protecting me in a way. I sense different presences some times, and even when they are hostile I feel like I don't have to worry. I never get harmed in any way from these ""entities"", and I think my dear friend here has something to do with it.

Anyone had a similar experience? Should I be concerned about what's happening? I really want to earn its trust, any ideas on how to do it?

Sorry for the long ass post, it's just something that's been on my mind and I feel like this is the best place for me to share it. Thanks for the read!"

I saw this once in real life where a sidewalk preacher removed a marijuana demon from a man.

His nose started bleeding a lot.

My daughter was having really bad nosebleeds while she was messing with Tarot cards.

Also... she was throwing her clothes all over the floor. I thought this was very strange. Is there a demon of messyness?

t3_famrrd,all_ads,I woke up with strange markings on my hands and palms.,Thetruthishere,"This was around the time I was in middle school. I woke up one Saturday morning with these very strange markings, mostly on the inside of my hands and palms, it looked like these really strange designs that you can compare to crop circles, or kind of like henna for a wedding, (henna is a dye used to make patterns and designs on the brides hand on the day of her wedding in some Arabic and middle eastern countries). It was some sort of black ink, and upon waking up I didn’t think much of it, assuming maybe it could have been my younger siblings messing with me in my sleep. I went to the bathroom to wash the “ink” off, but as soon as I turned on the water and placed my hands under, it was NOT the water that washed off this so called ink, It very strangely and mysteriously just sort of disappeared off my skin. I kind of brushed it off that day and went about. Years after this incident, I remember talking to a friend about it. He told me in the Islamic religion, there’s a legend about the jinn (Arabic for ghosts) that invites people to their weddings without the person’s knowledge, and sort of has their wedding around said person while they are sleeping. He said that the strange markings on my hands were the jinns version of henna, and that they drew these designs on my hand as part of my “invitation ritual” during their wedding party. I have also ran into other people who have woke up with similar stories of a mysterious ink or dye on their hands or palms that disappears shortly after awakening. Really creepy, I would love to know if any of you have experienced anything similar."
t3_fapcye,all_ads,"Stalked by a Shadow, has anybody else experienced this?",Thetruthishere,"I’ve posted this before on another thread. This became a frequent occurrence for a long time and although I’m free of it now, the memory still haunts me. Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom.

Between the ages of around 8-17 something used to watch me sleep.

A bit of background: I lived in a mobile home at the time and my room was on one end and my parents room was on the other end. The way my bed was facing was perpendicular to the door where I could see all the way to my parents room from my bed.

For some reason I could not sleep with the door shut without horrible anxiety, it felt like something  bad would be on the other side. I also felt compelled to stare down the hall until I fell asleep, If I turned my back to the door I immediately turned back over because of an increasing feeling of dread. 

I’m trying to sleep one night, hadn’t been in bed long, when I saw it. A tall dark silhouette in the middle of the hall. It didn’t have any features it was just darker than the darkness around it and I could not see through it. I was confused at first and called out for one of my parents to ask why they were just standing in the hall. This thing didn’t move or make a sound. I realized with horror that this was not one of my parents, I stared at it in terror and after a few agonizing minutes it melted into the dark and I could see to the other side of the house again. After that I shut my eyes and refused to open them until the sun was up. My parents didn’t believe me, nobody had ever died in that house. I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, but was sure that I had been awake at the time. 

It happened again a few weeks later and then started occurring with increasing frequency going from once a month or so to sometimes twice a week. It scared the hell out me every time. Even though it didn’t have any features whatsoever I could feel it staring at me. My mom once suggested that it was a guardian angel, but no guardian angel would emanate such a feeling of malice. 

Eventually we renovated my room and I got a new bed and it was placed on the same wall as the door so that I could no longer look down the hall. I was extremely opposed to the idea at first, but the first night I got the best sleep I’d had in years. I was no longer compelled to stare at the door, I could turn my back to it or even close it if I wished. It was wonderful. 

Several months later I had been in bed for probably half an hour when I I looked over and found it standing in my room 3 feet from me. I was absolutely horrified, it had never moved from its place in the hall and now it was within arms reach. I just stared at it, shaking, until it melted into the door. 

A few months later I had just laid down when I heard someone in the bathroom next to my room. I thought it was my father and I had a question so I called out to him, but no answer. I thought that was odd, so I rolled over to get up and talk to him. I heard the bead curtain in my doorway move and watched as someone leaned in and around the corner to look at me then back out and the curtain fell back into place. It was just a silhouette, no features. I went to my parents room and asked if they had just been down the hall and of course they had been in bed for at least 20 minutes. 

I was tired of dealing with this thing and I was angry now. I tore the house looking for I don’t know what while telling it that I’d had enough. I haven’t seen it since, I don’t live there anymore, but I always had the feeling that it was attached to me not the house. I’ve had several other creepy incidents in other houses, but haven’t been bothered by this creep again.

TL;Dr: Shadow person watched me sleep for years, it felt malicious. Finally stopped bothering me when I got mad and told it off."
t3_fag6hi,all_ads,Why did I cry at a family vault?,Thetruthishere,"Ok I don't know if this even is anything paranormal or whatever, but whenever I think back to it I just get confused. When I was about 13, i visited a pretty old church in England (built in the 1400s if I remember correctly). There was a rather large graveyard there, and we had a walk around there, reading the names. I ended up wandering off to a different area on my own and came across a family vault. I swear as soon as I started reading the inscription my eyes were tearing up, I froze up? And then it was less ""tearing up"" and more sobbing. I have no links that I know of to this area, and I have tried putting my age into account but even that doesnt make sense, as I didnt feel ""unstable"" because of hormones. After that, I felt dazed all day, and walking around the village I just had a really weird feeling that I cant describe. I really cant think of any reasons as to why I would cry like I did in such a random place for no reason, anyone have any ideas? Or was I just a baby lol."
t3_fb0pdy,all_ads,Any idea what this is? [DIS],Thetruthishere,"Hi, so I am working on the assumption that this is not paranormal but havent has luck on other subs. Was hoping maybe someone here had an idea what I partially captured last night. Any ideas would be helpful.

Last night was walking my dog and looked up in the sky and saw what almost looked like a arch (not a steep one, nearly flat). I stopped for a few mins to watch it and it seemed to rotate very slowly. The photos do not capture the full size but best I could do with the phone. Any idea what it is? I’m thinking some sort of cloud, but figured reddit could help.

The photos are taken about 2 mins apart and maybe 5-6 linear feet of change in my position.

For those who can’t tell it’s the streak in the middle of the photo just above the trees.

t3_fasbzv,all_ads,"Watched by a shadow man at midnight (6 years ago, still freaks me out to this day)",Thetruthishere,"(Okay so this is gonna be a longish one because you kinda have to get the feel of my house, so you can see the picture) 

My step dad has his own house, my Mom and I moved in my first year of highschool, I was 14. Everything went well for a year and I got first pick of my room, the one closest to the lounge so my baby sister could be closer to my parents. Our rooms are along the passageway on the left, and across from it is the bathroom and the kitchen doors. The lounge had a door and my parents had the room at the end of the hallway, and the lounge door was across from it directly. We have a house alarm system and we would close the doors to the kitchen and lounge (locking the lounge one) so our cat wouldn't trip the alarm. The room next door was largely unoccupied since my sister is clingy and slept with my parents more than not, but it didn't bug me. The two rooms are exactly the same size and are quite small, but my Mom gave me her queen size bed and because my room is tiny the foot of the bed was about half a ruler length away from the door when open, which it always is, not fully because I have a desk stopping it at the foot of my bed. 

One night in mid March or so I woke up at about 2 am, no idea why but all I knew is I was scared. I looked up towards my door and a light was on somewhere very faintly, I still don't know where but it wasn't from any of the rooms and in the light was a person standing at the foot of my bed, half covered by the door. He was short and stocky and had a hat on. He looked like an old school mafia member in those movies, with a suit jacket and one of those hats that big bosses in those same movies wear. I can't think of the name. He had no face and he didn't move. He just stood. I thought my stepdad had come to check on me, but something told me not to call out. I dove under my covers and prayed till I passed out, I couldn't make sure he wasn't there, in fact I think he stood there until after I passed out. I was sure I was awake, and the next morning I asked my Mom and my stepdad if he had checked on me. No one had been awake or come into my room to check up on me. My Mom was skeptical when I told her and my stepfather too but believed me. It never came back but a year and a bed change to a single later I felt the same presence behind me in the same spot twice, but a woman. I never looked at her I never said anything. I just stayed awake until I finally dozed off. I am now even more petrified of the dark at 22 and don't sleep without my phone torch being on or the light on. I still live in the house, in the same bedroom... I haven't seen or felt either since but sometimes get very uncomfortable in the middle of the night. No one else in the house has been plagued by shadow people either. Just me. (my Mom sometimes hallucinates them because of her meds but nothing like my experience)"

I grew up in the area and not only had many experiences of my own, but remember stories from other people who lived/worked in/frequented these areas (especially the private security guards. Wish I remembered their stories better!)

These areas include:

Jackson Highway 16 - which connects them all \*This includes a locally known Sloughhouse Inn &amp;amp; Diner, located right off the highway. I personally had an experience while simply driving this highway, same goes for two people I know, each happening separately but in the same area

Wilton/Dillard

Rancho Murieta (where most experiences I had/know of took place)

Amador County


I am hoping to keep it specific to the areas listed above, but if you are from (or have stories about) the general Sacramento area, and are ready to share your stories, please do!"
t3_fapvpc,all_ads,Hallucinations in the dark,Thetruthishere,I was wondering why I experience some pretty strange  hallucinations when I lay in bed at night. They vary a lot and can be very small to full fledged openings in my ceiling. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this and knows why it happens.
t3_fakapp,all_ads,Coiencidence?,Thetruthishere,"First off I am not even sure if this belongs on here. Sorry in advance if it doesn't. Last year for my birthday in June my boyfriend bought me a book because I love to read. I asked why did he pick the book he did, and he said ""It's the author my grandmother used to read so I thought you might like it."" The book he bought me is called Woman of God by James Patterson. I didn't read the book until around early this past November and it is an emotionally wrenching book. The main character loses a lover, two husbands and a child through out the novel. The entire way though she is pushing through it through faith and doing good deeds. It was a good read. Then on November 26 2019 my boyfriend passed away quite suddenly and unexpectadely. Today I thought of that book. In a way it was preparing me for what was to come. I guess I'm just wondering if him buying me this book was some sort of twist of fate that was supposed to happen? Thanks for reading."
t3_f9ziia,all_ads,Will soon possess a haunted doll...Suggestions for containment?,Thetruthishere,"Hi all!

In about two weeks, I will be receiving a haunted doll in the mail. It's an older Harlequin Mime doll, standing 18 inches tall. Picture [Here](https://imgur.com/VyFyS8j)

I've never dealt with a haunted doll before, and this one is described as active, and full of bad juju. I'd suggest not looking at the picture for too long, as particularly sensitive folks report headaches. I myself feel a tightness when looking into its eyes, and it's not particularly pleasant.

I plan to do a long term investigation on him, but, some of the reported paranormal activity is on the far side of negative. It's described as a nightmare bringer, manipulative, and potentially dangerous. During their investigation, they ended up consecrating and destroying an Ouija Board because the entity within the doll had them convinced that without an immediate end to communication, it would bring ""others"" through. He's a liar and lover of chaos. He's known to bring up bad memories through EVPs in attempts to shame you...

One of the more worrisome facets of his description is he likes to attempt to make deals for information and material wealth, in return for chaos.(Demonic?)

Does anyone have any suggestions on how best to contain it?

My current idea is a sealed case with holy symbols and my own mix of Chaos magic sigils of protection. Only removing it when I want to study, and communicate.

Any suggestions and questions are welcome!

Note: Outside of reports from someone I consider reputable, I do not have any physical evidence of doll possession. Once I have the doll, you can expect anything I find, I will post.

Notes for clarification:

I did not purchase this doll. The current owners are shipping it to me, free of charge. I met them at a ghost hunt a few years back, and they are apparently really well known for their haunted doll collection. They received this doll a while back, and it's energy doesn't mesh with their own. They dislike it, and want it gone.

I volunteered.

With that being said, could it not be haunted? Sure. But I also don't think they would spend their own money to ship it to me unless they REALLY wanted it gone.

So far we've got one mention of the picture making someone uncomfortable.

We have:

Glass case

Vacuum sealing?

Salt circle

Holy symbols

Gold and Silver

So far so good!

t3_fao0d1,all_ads,The disembodied voices pushed me over the edge,Thetruthishere,"This happened to me years ago.  A little bit of a back story of the site.  My Aunt's home is supposedly built on a Native American burial site.  Or so I've been told that.  My cousins would share their experiences with me but I only half believed. 

On to my experience.....

By this time the sun is going down and the street lamps are starting to turn on.  I see a woman walking, holding hands with a toddler.  As they turn right at the corner I notice it's not a toddler at all.  It is a doll type thing, for lack of better words, walking and it turns back to look at me.  It gives me this horrible wide white grin.  It's hair was string and its legs were like the accordion style legs you give a paper doll in elementary school.  I was completely freak out!!!  So, again I tell myself I'm imagining thigs and go inside.  It's time for bed and I am trying not to think of the odd things that happened.  I start praying and hoping I don't see or hear anything while it's night time.  Then I hear it, well them.  I hear my cousin, clear as day, fighting with her husband.  Full on fighting over where he's been and how she hates it here.  Thing is, here was in Hawaii, they were living in Hawaii at the time.  I ended up crying myself to sleep cause my mom wouldn't pick me up that night.  Needless to say I have not been back there since.

t3_faenxy,all_ads,Update,Thetruthishere,Hello all. It’s been a while since I’ve posted. Things have really calmed down here from where they were. Nothing has come from the last skinwalker sighting me and my cousin had around Christmas and so far it’s stayed that way. The only thing that I’ve experienced has been at my work with a supposed ghost. I work at a hotel and people checked out of the second floor prematurely for the 3rd time this month and said they got spooked but I don’t know of anything to do with it yet. Anyways I’m not dead! :)
t3_fa703x,all_ads,Robert the doll experiences,Thetruthishere,"In December I went to Key West and visited the famous Robert the Doll. I was familiar with his history and etiquette for meeting him before going so I was as respectful as possible and even brought him candy. Before we approached his room I saw something moving in the glare of the glass display. When we went in the room no one was there and we couldn't explain what I saw. I asked to take his photo and felt like I wasn't get any bad vibes so I did take it. My husband, being the skeptic he is, was somewhat joking about the whole thing but I don't think he said anything disrespectful.

We went back to our airbnb the next day and this place had a really creepy atmosphere. We had been staying there for over a month by that point and several of our friends had eerie experiences but nothing too crazy. We were in the house alone the first night back and we heard noises in the empty laundry shoot. Checked it, still completely empty.

We went to bed and I felt like something was off. After taking forever to fall asleep I was woken up at around 2am to noises on the floor. I didn't open my eyes at first because my brain was trying to give a logical answer for why it sounded like someone was going through our suitcase in the middle of the night. I listened for at least a minute before opening my eyes to see a Victorian woman in a white dress standing on my husband's side of the bed. Her face was covered by a white lace veil but I knew in that moment that this was not a spirit, it was something else. I was frozen in fear and unable to move for a good twenty seconds before I started screaming and pushing my husband to wake him up. It faded into the wall infront of my eyes. By the time my husband fully woke up and realized something was wrong I was shaking and hyperventilating. I had never seen an entity before. 

I smudged the entire house (which was a mansion so that shit took forever) and while I was ringing the bells to chase evil out the door to our bedroom slammed in my face as I approached it. Our friends came back that night and we didn't have any more experiences.

Do you think this was Robert? I feel like it wasn't, but it could have been related. I already felt weird about the house before we went and maybe I just opened myself up too much to interact with the paranormal.

Two weeks later we went to Vegas and went through Zak Bagans Haunted Museum which had lots of equally famous haunted dolls. That night in the hotel room our sink faucet turned on by itself. You have to physically turn the knob to get water to come out and we heard it turning before the water started. We tried and could not debunk it. 

No more experiences since December though and it was by pure coincidence that we saw so many haunted dolls in one month, it definitely wasn't planned.

Td:lr In December I visited a lot of haunted dolls and weird shit happened."
t3_fakq64,all_ads,"Sleep Talking but wide awake?! ""It shows what it feels like to be alive""",Thetruthishere,"This is a super creepy encounter I had with my boyfriend last week. Basically I sleep wayyy earlier than he does so hes awake for a couple hours while I sleep. One morning he asked if I remember waking up around 3 am and I just looked at him like what are you talking about because I dont remember it at all! It's pretty typical to not remember briefly waking up in the middle of sleep but he said I was like wide awake and was sitting up. At this point im thinking hes messing with me since he knows I get scared pretty easily. He said I sat up and looked at him and said some incoherent word thats starts with the letter N. I think he said it started like ""nan"" or ""non"" or something like that. It wasn't english or any language he knows. And apparently I just kept saying it until he asked what it meant and I literally got chills ALL over my body when I heard what I replied with. Apparently I said the word meant ""it shows what it feels like to be alive"". I mean who says that?! what word was i saying??! I joked around saying i got possessed but in all honesty im super creeped out! Has anyone else experience this or just happen to know what word i was saying?? It's crazy I don't remember any of it!! I was physically sitting up and having a conversation with someone but yet the next morning i honestly thought i slept through the night! Bf said he slighty touched me and thats what woke me up but I'm a pretty deep sleeper so someone touching me shouldnt just jolt me awake like that. Hella creeped out.

TDLR: BF slightly touched me which woke me up in the middle of my sleep to which I said some weird word that means ""to show what it feels like to be alive"""
t3_fae8yu,all_ads,Strange Pre Sleep Experience,Thetruthishere,"Hello there!

Dont know if this belongs here at all but it does involve the sleep state. Last night I had a pretty odd experience happen and Im just looking for any advice or if anyone can relate to this. I had just climbed into bed, wife there as well. Im laying there trying to fall asleep when I feel this odd feelings of extreme fear and what I can only describe as impending insanity approaching in waves. I wish I could say how it felt right before it subsided before I would open my eyes or something to try and break the feeling. But opening the eyes didnt stop it either. Just weird waves of terror and insanity in my mind. The whole time im trying to hold onto my SELF and know that whatever physical or mental sensations come,  I am watching it come and go. I also could hear this background noise in my head of what kept seeming like thousands of screams melding into one. Its really hard to explain, I've never felt something like that in my life. Anyone have similair feelings? Please and thanks."
t3_fa715y,all_ads,Help Identify? Paranormal Experience,Thetruthishere,"A friend of mine was just telling me about this story, and I wanna figure out what happened. heres the details and story, im not a super knowledgeable person in terms of paranormal, but we both believe in spirits, cryptids, and other things like that....
we live in the mountainy part of the US too. 


She frequently drives around in just weird or unknown to her areas and earlier this week she was driving in a new place and suddenly got just this awful feeling of dread and being in danger (She is a native american so she relies on and trusts her psyche and spiritual senses). She says she’s never felt like that before. She’s genuinely down to earth but she was convinced she would die that night. She also felt like she was being followed. She drove past a jehovahs witness church but there were no other buildings around. she started to turn around (just did a u-turn) and she just felt like she was going to die, that she was in danger. she’s a naturally fast driver, but she was so freaked out that she drove even faster. she recalls hitting a turn and almost losing control of the car. 
another important detail is she recalls driving and looking out her window to see a group of things. she described them as reflective things in sticks that looked like they may have been lawn ornaments or street signs, but they were too small and not square to be signs, and there were no buildings around. whats weird to me is that she looked at her gps which was taking her home and it said she was 4 minutes away, but she didn’t recognize the area at all. there are normally buildings and things around and she just did not know where she was or even believe she was actually near home. 

Please let me know your thoughts!"

t3_f9yms0,all_ads,My eyes turned black...!?,Thetruthishere,"
Here’s the story. Sorry for waiting a day, I was busy. This happened years and years ago so some parts are a little fuzzy for me but I’ll tell you what I can remember.

So it started off as a Normal summer day. Maybe 5pm. I was about, 11 or 12.
At the time I was staying at my moms house, it was a trailer, in the middle of nowhere, a cornfield. I lived with my younger brother as well. My older brother lived a couple of miles away at my grandparents house.
Me and my mom got into a big verbal fight one day. Not sure about what. She took my phone, I paid for it at the time. So I was a little upset about that, and whatever we were arguing about. 

(I remember after she took it, a loud ringing started coming from my phone, not a ringtone, it was way way louder, not sure what that was, it didn’t sound like it was coming from a speaker, I asked her, she didn’t answer.) 

I ended up basically throwing a fit and running away. I should also mention I had a fucked up child hood, my parents weren’t great. I know I lashed out sometimes but it was usually justified, usually, not always. 

So we lived in the middle of nowhere, corn fields on all sides of our house, with one long empty road running through them/in front of our house. 

So I ran away. First I walked down the long road, for miles. I was walking for a couple of hours. I made it to a house with a blue truck, then I turned around and started heading back home.

 (I don’t remember much of the walk back home or what happened next, my next memory is when it’s dark, almost pitch black, I’m near my house, in the cornfield, crouching down, a few hundred feet back, watching my family in the yard looking for me)

Turns out my older brother and the police showed up. The police left for some reason. 

I was crouching down just playing with the dirt, un sure of what to do, I was bored.

Suddenly I heard a sound right behind me, there’s was an animal literally about a foot or two behind me. I knew because it made this ticking yelp sound, I can’t describe it, a weird sound I had never heard before, (later discovered it was probably a coyote), I was filled with instant fear and my fight or flight kicked in. 

Suddenly I jumped up, still half crouching because I didn’t want to be seen by my family, I sprinted faster than I ever have, across the whole field, I mean insanely fast, I’ve always been known for being a fast runner, but this time was different, I was filled with fear and adrenaline, I shit you not I ran faster then I’ve seen anyone ever run in my whole life. I ran for about a minute. Crouched down for 2 seconds or so. Then ran another hundred feet or so. 
Then crouched down. Looking around me into the darkness. Still filled with this animal instinct, (which could have been the cause for my black eyes).

At this time I was pretty close to the house, like 50 feet from the property line still crouched down. My older brother spots me, he says “(my name) is that you?” I don’t respond. I didn’t want him to see me and I could sense the fear in him as he was walking up. 

He walks up, now 4 feet from me, I look at him, he says something along the lines of 
“(My name) your eyes are completely black” I could sense he was afraid and filled with fear, I still didn’t want to be found at the time. I thought it would be funny to scare him, for whatever reason I’m not sure why. I lunged out from my crouching position at him, while hissing, running towards him, and he bolted back to the house.

I literally don’t remember a single thing after this point. I’m not sure why. Or even what happened to this day, I never asked my family either I figured it’s best to not bring this night up.

I’ve heard stories of people’s eyes going black when they are in a complete state of fear or anger, I’m not sure if that’s why mine turned black or not, if they even did..

I asked him about this night awhile back and he swore that my eyes were completely black.

Anyways what do you guys think this means?"

t3_f9vcdn,all_ads,Spiritual entity led me to painting and some gold. Sign? Meaning?,Thetruthishere,"You can refer to my previous post for background info on my situation.

A spiritual entity / alien has been visiting me all month during meditation, but I've always remained on the couch. Today, feb 26th, right after midnight, the entity had me stand up and it pointed my head towards the door to outside. I walk over in that direction and it pulls me towards the door still. So I put on my jacket and shoes and head outside. 

I live in a mansion with an elevator; it can take you a while to walk around the house. The entity pulls me down a walkway, up the stairs,  to the very end of the balcony where noone really goes. I see a chair in the direction its pulling me so I sit down. It turns my head towards this painting and I pick it up and carry it back to the basement to have a closer look. 

[Goat pic](https://imgur.com/DCb8Dhb)

It's a picture of a goat leaning over a fence. What is it trying to show me? Sign? Does anyone know of any goat symbology? Some help on this would be appreciated.

After I took a picture of it, the entity had be go all the back to where the painting hang and put it back. It even made me turn around and fix the painting because I left it crooked lol. I get back to the basement and it starts pulling me towards this creepy ass room:

[room](https://imgur.com/pb8y952)

It led me into that back part and turned my head to the left. I picked up the trophy and left. It made me go back in and as I stood in the back part it turned my head to the left again. In front of me was some random cup. So I picked it up and there's a necklace and a ring. The gold was real. I was surprised. 

[Ring](https://imgur.com/vDvVG8p)
[necklace](https://imgur.com/oZd79H4)

I wasn't sure which piece it was interested in so I put them on opposite sides of a table. The entity turned my head towards the ring and had me put it on. It was too small, but I did anyway as far as i could. And then it still pointed me to the necklace so i put that on too. Then it went back to business as usual in meditation. Any insights will be helpful, thank you.

**UPDATE**

I told my mom everything that happened last night, and I showed up the painting. She said she bought that last year around the time of my spiritual awakening / mania incident. She said in fact, it was the very same weekend as your incident. Fucking spooky shit, but the journey continues."
t3_f9qrmi,all_ads,Mile Marker Lady,Thetruthishere,"Once again, here's another story that was told to me by my ex-husband and if memories serve me correct it happened to his ex-stepmother's stepfather who I'll call Tom\* (try wrapping your brain around that).

Anyway, here's his story.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Years ago, Tom was working at a job (I can't remember where) where he would oftentimes work late. So it wasn't unusual for him to be driving home late at night.

As you know, highways are littered with mile markers and Louisiana was no exception.

One night while driving home he noticed a lady wearing a white dress standing near mile marker 5\* (I can't remember the exact number) and although he felt bad for the lady he didn't stop.

She was beautiful with her long flowing hair and the dress she was wearing reminded him of one of those dresses from the 1800s.

He continued to drive and noticed that each time he passed a new mile marker, he would see the lady in white standing there.

Naturally, this creeped him out so he stepped on the gas, not once slowing down so I guess you could say he put the pedal to the metal.

But anyway, just before approaching the next mile marker though he looked into his rearview mirror and got the shock of his life because sitting in the backseat was none other than the lady in white this time with a malicious look on her face that quickly distorted into something hideous.

As he was fastly approaching mile marker 8\* he began to hear this evil laughter that echoed throughout his car but ignored it (although he was scared shitless) and kept driving.

Apparently, she began to wail like a banshee because he was getting away.

Eventually, she vanished from his car but what was to follow was even scarier...

He then saw movement off to his right and what he saw, he would never forget...

It was the same lady in white chasing him but this time it was just her disembodied head that was cackling like a witch.

The head also seemed to be getting bigger and at times would make its appearance inside his car scaring him even more.

Her head began to weave in and out of Tom's car all the while continuing to pursue him (or I should say her head continued to pursue him) keeping the same pace as the car that was until finally, they reached mile marker 9\* and then, she vanished.

Needless to say, he didn't hang around long and made it home in record time.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Oh, in case you're wondering Tom continued to take that highway for twenty or so more years but never experienced the lady in white again. Anyway, for some reason when I think about this story it reminds me of the short story in Creepshow 2 about the hitchhiker and for some reason I always feel compelled to say to myself, ""Thanks for the ride, lady."""
t3_f9abb3,all_ads,Theory on why beings from other dimensions (shadow people) appear as smoke.,Thetruthishere,"I got this idea because I just took a hot shower and came outside it's cold so my body is smoking.

Everything in the universe vibrates at a different frequency this is known fact.

I'f a being from a lower frequency comes into a dimension with a higher vibration wouldn't there vibration rise giving off the smoke effect. When something boils its particles move faster.

To start, I was in my kitchen, just enjoying a glass of milk, when an incredibly loud bang came from my front door. When I say front door, I actually mean door(s). There’s a glass door on the outside, and a heavy wooden door on the inside, one on top of the other. This is important because the force from whatever made that sound was strong enough to cause the wooden door to rock on its hinges. My immediate reaction was to run out to check what it was. There was nothing outside, no damage on the glass, my dog wasn’t even barking even though she’s extremely protective of the house. What I did notice was that a swing to the left of my porch was spinning wildly. If anyone needs clarity, I’ll be glad to respond in the comments. I’m going to keep investigating after I post this"

About less than half a block down I heard or felt (trouble describing how this sounds) this voice said TURN BACK NOW!! I didn’t feel scared and the dogs didn’t alert like they heard anything. It was just so overwhelming I felt like there was no question or discussion about it. I told my friend we have to leave now and turned around. By the time we reached the point we came from we decided to stay on our normal route and nothing else happened. My friend was freaked out a bit but me the one has PTSD and anxiety felt totally calm in the whole thing. Interested in hearing any explanation or similar encounters. God, intuitive, angels, aliens?

t3_f9bh6s,all_ads,Why Do People Want to See Entities?,Thetruthishere,"I see entities regularly, ever since I was a toddler (25+ years). Ghosts, shadow people, angels, you name it.

t3_f9hvao,all_ads,Can a shadow person try to strangle you?,Thetruthishere,"So yesterday I found this subreddit and spent the day reading it and at I a certain point I felt like I needed to stop reading it because I was had some kind of feeling that it might attract the attention of the nasty critters but I didn't really have anything to base this on so I stopped for a while and then started up again. I had been reading a lot of posts about shadow people and in the comments there was a lot about sleep paralysis which I had previously never experienced at least not in the terrifying way that every one describes but it IS A symptom of restless leg syndrome which I have. But I am also medicated for it. 

So I go to bed last night kinda wishing that I hadn't read so many spooky stories before bed. 

In the middle of the night I feel like I have woken up and above me on the bed is a humanoid figure made of shadows and I have the impression that its hands are around my throat although I am not experiencing any trouble breathing. And I cannot move. And I remembered from all the posts that I had read yesterday that i am supposed to be stronger than anything that comes at a person while they are in sleep paralysis so I fight the paralysis and I have a bite gaurd in my mouth because I clench my teeth and night and I start trying to force the words ""go away"" out of my mouth and move my arm to wake up my fiance and eventually I am able to force the words out after a lot of shitty mumble attempts and get my arm to touch my guy. And after I say go away it does and the sun comes up and my guy wakes up in my dream and is like admiring the way the sunlight hits my face (and I sleep with black out curtains so this part is definitely fiction) and then I actually wake up.

The weird thing is that I didn't have a lot of feelings of serious lingering fear I mostly feel loved but I am still half of sleep but like a safe half asleep and I ""go away"" out loud for real this time and then I roll over to snuggle with my guy even though it was too warm and fell back asleep.


Now until yesterday I didn't know anything about shadow people specifically. But when I was a sophmore high school I would go on walks with my dog to the local park at night. (Night is a stretch I live in Minnesota so it was like going at 6:00 but it was dark) 
And I always had the impression of shadows being where they didn't belong and watching me and when  sensation of movement at the corners of my eyes and when I got home I'd find new bruises on my arms and legs.  At the time I had just read a the book Tithe at the time so convinced myself it was get creatures. So I stopped going out at night but I had a lot of trouble sleeping at night because I just felt like I was being watched. It was that feeling you had when you were a child where you are too scared to open your eyes for fear of what was in your room at night but as a high schooler. 

Everyone told me I was imagining it and I was like ""I mean, like, I know but it means my mind is a horrible place to be. 

Years later I was diagnosed as bipolar and I just chalked it up to that but it should be noted that I am type 2 bipolar and since then I have had no hallucinations I would just get really depressed or when I was manic I would just get really artisticly productive and a little slutty and bubblier and I'd spend all of my money on stupid shit. 


Anyway i just wanted to get some feedback on whether it was just an odd dream? Especially because it seems like shadow people are mostly just kinda watchers from the posts i read yesterday.


Edit:
I also want to add that I am well medicated for bipolar and I have 0 symptoms. And I am also in the happiest time of my life that I have ever been. I live with my fiance and I just feel like my whole life is suffused with love. It seems like normally sleep paralysis and shadow people tend to happen to people in emotionally fraught situations or like puberty but I'm 27"
t3_f8z2eg,all_ads,3/3 siblings abducted possibly because of our fucked up genetics.,Thetruthishere,"Last year I posted my possible abuction story with my youngest brother (Danny). Long story short, it was the scariest night of my life without seeing what we were up against. I felt it strengthened our sibling bond although I felt relieved at least one of us was spared.

While casually talking to my other [the spared] brother (Carl) about dreams, he said ""Hey remember that one time when we were young, I dreamed there were three kids in costume trying to corner me? It's so weird that it's so clear it feels like a memory."" I told him to describe the ""kids"" to us again, and as he did, his face started to twist into horror the same time as mine. His description was basically grey aliens and he just realized it after all these years!  He said there were three of them who have cornered him against the bedroom wall (one was holding a syringe). Somehow they were telling him to calm down because they just need a blood sample. So nope, no one was spared afterall.

That was how we got convinced 3/3 of us have most likely been abducted.

The other night, Carl texted me while I was at my girlfriend's. He was panicking because something was violently vibrating inside his leg. He said it was nothing like a spasm but more like a phone set in silent vibrating from a call. He said whatever it was felt tiny and couldn't be felt by his finger. He didn't tell Dan because he didn't want to scare him at midnight, being in the countryside practically alone with our grandma.

Just 3 hours after Carl's texts, Dan called me freaking out. He said something's vibrating inside his nape and described it exactly as Carl described his. 

There are also things that freak me out most likely related to our possible abduction:

-Our dad says since he was a kid he's been seeing blond people outside his window looking at him [he said they looked exactly like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTEX8s0hsePh-rOGicU8xxwLjMtFX0ht5eW5aLjO1mzKlLDmPvk). (Many reported abductees have ascendants or descendants who were observed as well. Maybe our dad's a subject too?) PS: We live in Asia

-Our paternal side of genetics is FUCKED UP. My dad came from at least 3 generations of inbreeding. (Wealthy European family in a colonial country, so for wealth-preservation). My clan is plagued by ultra rare cancers, physical deformities, and even internal mutations so my theory is we're being studied for this.

-We've been seeing UFOs since we were kids. One time, we had a new pretty powerful camera and we successfully shot tons of photos and videos of them. By morning, they were gone from the camera! Like somebody snuck in our house to delete JUST those proofs.

-Carl and I have insane streetlight interference. Streetlights turn off when we walk under them. Even streetlights that have been dead for months will turn on only during the moment we walk under them.

-In Dan's case, transistor radios go static when he goes near them.

Our uncle is a radiologist so we asked him to xray us to look for implanted chips or capsules but he found nothing. We're afraid we will experience a worse abduction but honestly what can be done?"
t3_f9d23u,all_ads,I was lifted up and put to bed by something,Thetruthishere,"So, you know how as kids, we used to pretend to be asleep so our parents can take us up? Well, this was CRAZY and I remember it like yesterday.
I was around 6 or 7

I did the usual thing, lay down, close my eyes in the car. That’s when I feel myself being lifted up. I hear the garage door open, and then walking up the stairs, and then the other stairs that takes me up. That’s when I open my eyes and notice that I’m floating with no one holding me. But they were doing the movments a human would do, such as when you step on a step, you get lifted a little more. It was as though they were invisible. This entity took me to my room, placed me on the bed and pulled the covers over me, before it disappeared. I have NEVER had something like that happen to me, and it was crazy no less."
t3_f97brw,all_ads,Not sure what happened,Thetruthishere,"So I just had a weird experience.

I was typing on the computer at work and at the bottom of my vision, I see a small dark shadowy thing race across to the left near the floor. I initially thought it was a rodent that had scurried across the floor but caught it before it disappeared and it looked like a dark shadow. I was ready to write it off as a trick of the light but then I turned around and looked at a blank space of the carpet. Out of seemingly nowhere a black oval shape appeared in the middle of my vision, raced across to the left and then just disappeared into nothing. It seemed to be quite large, an oval round shape, and had a solid outline, and was completely black like a shadow.

I honestly don't know what it was. There was nothing in the office to create a shadow that shape and size and I tried to create a similar shadow but the light only produced a weak greyish shadow, not even close to the shade of black I saw. It really stunned me.

So I either hallucinated an object or saw something unexplainable. Open to either option. Either way, I would love to know if anyone has had a similar experience or know of anyone who has."
t3_f92bjf,all_ads,Little Red Dog,Thetruthishere,"Preface: Both my mom and I have talked to each other about having paranormal experiences. For the most part, they’ve been fairly tame—things like knocks on the wall late at night or hearing sudden groans while being home alone. One time however, while we were house searching, we were touring a house that had a room in the basement with a 3 ft hole in the wall that led to a pitch dark space. My little sister, 3 years old at the time, looks into the hole, waves, laughs and says hi with a giggle. Needless to say, we didn’t end up moving into that house.

One night, about 6 years later during my winter break from college, my mom and I were in the kitchen having a long conversation. My mom was standing up, leaning over the small island and I was a few feet away from her sitting at the dining table. My little sister was at the table as well coloring in her notebook. As we’re talking, I distinctly see a small red dog run down the stairs, directly in front of my feet, and down the hall towards the basement. I figured I must have been trippin. I looked over at my mom and she looked extremely concerned. She asked me, “Did you just see that?” I replied, “The red dog?” Her eyes widened and she nodded her head. The next day, she sent us all to my grandma’s house and prayed and saged the house."
t3_f938py,all_ads,Shadow people?,Thetruthishere,"So to start, this all took place at my grandparents house. The house is fairly new but they have plenty of creepy, hundreds of years old, objects laying around. Some backstory on previous paranormal activity below: 
The only other weird things I can remember, other then what I will tell later on,  are that we played an ouija board a couple of times with no results, and my grandma had a old cabinet filled with very old random objects, like Indian smoke pipes, ancient Chinese bowls, skeleton keys, very old figures made of clay, just random old artifacts. The cabinet had a lock on it and was always locked. But for a period of time every time I came over the cabinet door would open half way, weirdly, I noticed it first, most of the time. I talked to them about it and they said it stays locked and only ever opens by itself when I come over. I just thought that was weird. It happen about 20 times.

But this time I saw something out of this world. 
So it started at around 1-4am, I never looked at the time so I can only assume how late it was. I was in my grandparents spare bedroom, and happened to wake up in the middle of the night.
I woke up, and heard my little brother crying from out in the living room, I thought, weird... 
He was sleeping on the couch btw. So I got up and walked out there and asked him why he was crying. He said someone was running up and down the basement stairs. I didn’t believe him but something was weird, off.. I felt like I couldn’t trust him. Something made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Normally me being the curious person I am I would have went into the kitchen, open the basement door and checked/searched for myself. I would rather know than not know. But this time was different. I just felt off, something was weird about the situation. 
So let me give you a layout of the house. I was standing in the living room facing the couch my brother was on, directly behind me was the hallway that led back to my room, straight in front of me to the right, past the couch, was the kitchen door way. into the kitchen to the right was the basement doorway, to the left was the dining room. 
After a couple of seconds i see something in my 
Peripheral view, I look into the kitchen door way. I see a figure run past from the left to the right. Towards the basement door. I barely saw it as it was fast and I only saw it at the last second. I mainly only saw an arm. It was black. Well an ashy black color. Very skinny. And held horizontally. It moved past the doorway and I froze. In shock. All my hair was standing up. I freaked out and yelled at my brother, telling him what I saw. I flipped. Ran back to my room and locked and barricaded the door. Ready to fight if I needed to. I stayed up all night just watching my door.

Next day rolls around and my brother doesn’t remember it, i told him what happened, I asked him why he was crying and he said he just wanted to fuck with me. Which was weird because he woke me up by crying. I wasn’t even awake, no one was. How could he have been fucking with me? I even saw a fucking figure. I told everyone and they all seemed to brush it off like it wasn’t a big deal. Accept my grandma, she told me about the many paranormal experiences she’s had over the years. Weird.
I know their house is haunted.
What do you guys think?

Edit: my grandparents are pretty religious, if that means anything, I however am not, I don’t believe in god like they tell it, I don’t believe in heaven. Although I do believe someone/ something would of had to of created everything. Not a person. I think we’re likely in a simulation. Because there’s a lot of evidence to prove it and none to prove that god exists. Idk I’m not trying to get too philosophical. But I’m just saying I don’t really believe in god. If that means anything."
t3_f91xuc,all_ads,Me and my best friend saw something unexplainable,Thetruthishere,"     I don't have a lot of memories from my past. I've undergone a lot of trauma in my childhood that I've blocked out. Yet, this one memory is something so vivid and clear I can detail what we saw that night.

     It all happened in my backyard. My parents had a big bonfire for the neighborhood back then almost once a week. But they soon got a tiny fire pit closer to the house for just our personal family time. My best friend was always invited since she was always around. I was around seventh going into eighth grade that summer. And we had just gotten the smaller pit.

     My mom, dad, sister, nephew, and best friend were roasting marshmallows and just enjoying the night. Talking and laughing and just having fun. All of a sudden a very white figure appeared in the corner of my eye. On instinct my head turned to look at whatever was so out of place in the dark night. 

     My heart raced like it never had before and my eyes went really wide. Breathing picking up as what I saw was a white saber tooth tiger. It had the black stripes accompanying it's white fur. It SAW me and I saw it. But when I blinked it calmly walked behind my neighbors dog fence and disappeared. 

     I went to turn away as I'm used to seeing these things. But usually alone. I was afraid my whole life until that point I was crazy. That I was seeing things. But when my head turned so I could go back to my family my eyes met my best friends.
     
     Her eyes were way more frightened than mine. And she whispered to me. 
     ""Did you see that?"" Too which I was honestly stunned and replied yes. She was terrified, more so than I. And that's when my mom asked what we were talking about. 
     So before I could answer she responded with EXACTLY my own description. I knew I wasn't just seeing things as she had only asked if I saw what she saw. 
     
     My mom told us we were seeing things. No one else saw the white mass we did. They just saw darkness. We still talk about whatever it was. And she is still terrified to talk about it.

Has anyone else seen something like this? If so do you know what it is? It would bring me a little bit of relief to know what happened or what we saw that night... I think about it a lot even to this day."
t3_f9542d,all_ads,Mind connections,Thetruthishere,"So I saw a post in here just now about how this person was thinking of a place and their fiancé was able to guess it without anything being said as to where or what the place was and it reminded me of this thing that my friends and I used to do back in high school. 

My friends and I have always been very interested in the more psychic abilities that are me could possible have and we read this article in nice that said if you focus hard enough you can transfer thoughts (it gets easier the more you do it kinda thing) so of course we were curious and decided to test this out in class one day. 

Since we had a class together we each chose one person to try and connect with to see if it would work. No one said anything or did anything to give away who the person was. The key was to pretty much focus (don’t stare at them directly because people can feel that) and imagine a link of sorts going from your third eye to theirs and then imagine you sending a message or something to them. 

I decided to try this on someone who was sitting in front of me but to the left. That way I could see him but not have to be staring at him to do this. I decided to say turn around in my head to see if he would do it. The first time I did it nothing happened, he just say there. The second time he looked up from his own paper he was working on and the third time he turned his head to look to the back of the class, obviously confused as to why. 

Now, all of us tried this and had similar things happen. It took at least two tries for the person to react but they did do whatever it was we had thought in our heads (turn around, look at whatever object do this or that kinda thing. Stuff that isn’t typical movements of students I guess)

We used to do this kind of stuff all the time. It was interesting to see if it would work. It was like we were strengthening our third eyes. We even did this to each other. From what I remember when they would do it to me is that the first few times someone does it you can’t really tell the difference between you thinking it yourself and them sending the message. But if that person does it a few times you can identify their voice/energy. 

It’s a weird concept really, and I haven’t done it in a long time. But I do honestly think that we as humans can connect to each other in a spiritual way we just don’t always pick up on it."
t3_f8mcsn,all_ads,Nice guess babe... But could you kindly stay out of my brain please?,Thetruthishere,"I was sitting on the sofa staring blankly at the pause screen of a movie (alita battle angel in case you were  wondering) lost in deep thought when my fiancé waved his hand in my field of vision. He said “what are you thinking about?” I said (without looking away from the tv, which happened to be a still shot of the cyborg girl’s teary eyed face) “I just realized that I’ve been having recurring dreams with you in a place I’ve never been to.” 

He asked “where?” I pause for a moment and visualize the place I’m thinking of so I can describe it in better detail and in more than just a few words. As I’m thinking he sits down in his computer chair without looking at me and flatly states “a gas station.” I said what? What did you say??” He says “a gas station?” I’m lifting halfway off the sofa by now because I’m blown away, I’ve not once ever mentioned this dream location because the dreams are rather boring and insignificant. I said “that’s the location! My dreams happen at a gas station! How did you know that?!?!!!” 

He told me an image of a gas station just came to mind. I pressed him for more details and it turns out he was imaging a gas station out somewhere on a highway or in the woods somewhere. Where as the gas station I’ve been seeing in my dreams is in a city, somewhere near a large overpass, likely close to or connected to the interstate and there are other buildings around, of course. I find that these are pretty notable discrepancies, regardless, I’m still blown away, that of quite literally any location on this planet, and with absolutely no narrowing context whatsoever he threw out his first guess and he was right.

Anyway, it was weird and I just wanted to share it with someone, thanks for reading."

t3_f8u7ru,all_ads,Knott county KY— possible dogman,Thetruthishere,"
“A 13 year old boy was killed this past Tuesday in Knott county KY. I’ve been following the stories trying to stitch together the evidence to make some sense of it all. He was staying at a relatives house and familiar with the area. Playing in the back yard, relative called 911 at 6:pm saying the boy was being attacked by a canine type creature. First responders on site at 6:30, the 911 caller directed them up the mountain behind the house. They had difficulty getting up the mountainside because of the steep slick terrain but found the boy dead 300-400 feet straight up the rain slick mountain. State trooper reported “something is out there” coroner confirmed boy was killed by a canine type creature but can’t identify what exactly. The latest reports are “canine creature”.
No wolves in KY for decades. A full grown 40lb coyote can’t drag a 100lb dead body up a mountainside. No mountain lions in KY. A feral dog or even several feral dogs aren’t dragging 100 lbs of dead weight up a mountainside, Not a bear, coroner has determined cause of death to be a “canine type creature”. The funeral was yesterday. I have communicated with the relative who set up the go fund me page and three different reporters. All say “canine creature”. Coroner has had ample time to test dna, known animals would be easily identified but they aren’t saying what it was that killed the boy. A bear or mountain lion are the only two animals I know of that could kill a human and have the strength to drag him 100 yds up a rain slick mountainside. But it wasn’t a bear or mountain lion, coroner said canine creature killed him. Authorities are asking neighbors to be “hyper vigilant” of their surroundings.
Google 13 yr old boy killed by animal attack KY.
The story will most likely fade to black with no official ID of the animal or creature that killed him.”

Copy and pasted from a Facebook post. A young boy was killed here less than a hour from me. They keep saying “canine creature” but no one knows for sure. It’s rained near continuously so the terrain is so muddy it would be almost impossible to climb up a mountain side that he was found deceased on. “Canine creature” cannot be located. It was thought that it was a “pack of dogs” or “pack of coyotes” but neither pack has been located.

t3_f8e62u,all_ads,Shadow people are real,Thetruthishere,"When I was 16 my mother heard me talking in my sleep so she came in to check on me since this wasn't very common of me. She claims she saw what was a large shadow like figure make it's way across my room, but convinced herself that it was probably her mind playing tricks on her since my room was already so dark. She saw that I was fine so she went back to her room and forgot about the situation. 
Well, not 30 minutes or so later I woke up. It was pitch black, I looked towards my bedroom door and notice it slowly begin to creak open by itself. I called out to my mother assuming it was her and immediately after see a large black hazy figure enter my room through the door and glide across the wall until it reached a corner of my room where I lost sight of it. Mind you my room was dark, but the figure was oddly distinguishable. My mother heard my call and immediately knew what I what I had seen, almost like an ""I knew it"" realization. We turned on the lights and I told her what I saw and that's when she told me that she'd seen the figure when she came in to check on me earlier. Our shocked reactions woke up my father and younger brother. It was around 3 am or so by then. We didn't sleep that night and spent the rest of the early morning until sunrise trying to comprehend what we'd just witnessed.
What's interesting about this is, our house isn't known to be haunted. An incident like this never happened before and hasn't happened since, which only makes this even weirder in my opinion. 

I know this story is questionable, but I swear to this day It happened. We still talk about It from time to time.

Ask me anything, make your own interpretations/possible explanations, I do not mind.

Tldr; Mother saw a shadow figure, disregarded it. I saw the shadow figure, we both freak out."
t3_f8u0bm,all_ads,My Mom and I Think Our House is Haunted,Thetruthishere,"Okay so a while back I posted these stories on a subreddit somewhere, I can't remember which, but I posted it under a different account. I can't remember the login info so I made a new one. I thought I would make a new post with those experiences as well as some new ones.

We moved into my stepdad's house when he and my mom got married. It was him, my mom, my brother and I. My brother has since moved in with our dad, but he only lives about 20 min away. A long time ago my stepdad dreamed about a little girl in Victorian-Era clothing running around the hallway of the house. My mom and I occasionally hear something and we don't know what, so we've attributed these happenings to the little ghost girl my stepdad saw in his dream, and we affectionately call her Emma.

My brother (six years younger than me) used to get night terrors. I would wake up in the middle of the night and hear him whimpering or crying in his sleep, sometimes even talking. He would sometimes say he could hear a noise, almost like a vibration, only in his room.

I was home alone one day, and I was going through a phase where I was into ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and I was singing (badly). I heard a deep voice say ""STOP"".

Another time I was home alone and heard footsteps in the attic. 

My stepdad is a smoker and has been for years, and he very often will make a short ""coughing"" noise. Like a cross between coughing and clearing his throat. It's a very distinctive sound. When I was home alone, I heard that sound come from their bedroom. He was at work. 

Most recently my mom was in the kitchen and I was in the living room. It's an open floor plan so we can be in those rooms but still see each other and talk to one another. My mom was sweeping and she had set the dustpan on the counter. It wasn't close the the edge. We were talking and all of a sudden the dustpan FLIPPED off of the counter. Not just fell. It was as if someone unseen had come up and popped the handle of the dustpan to make it flip in the air and hit the ground.

Also, my mom and I have both seen ""faces"" and figures out of the corners of our eyes. This last part isn't really ""paranormal"" like the rest but it's still creepy. This doesn't always happen but we have a big window behind our table, and the sun will sometimes cast a reflection from the light fixture on the ceiling. It looks like a face, sinister almost. I'll try to link a picture! We know it isn't anything sinister or paranormal, but it is creepy looking. [The Face](https://imgur.com/a/aUu6Fys)"
t3_f8sh1u,all_ads,Something was tearing up the trees nearby,Thetruthishere,"I tagged along for one of many excursions into the woods to assist in a Wiccan friend’s ritual. He was my mentor and later on, my coven founder. 

Anyhow, this was about 2 years ago one fall evening. The sun was just going down and it was supposed to be a special moon phase (I can’t remember exactly, blood moon or maybe just full) and he had planned out to do a short ritual at the nearby park we always frequented at night. He needed assistance as it was a time-based ritual so I obliged. 

We went out into the hiking trails and found a spot suitable to not be disturbed by passerbys. To give a layout, we sat down sideways on the path, the woods both in front of and behind us with the trail going left and right. 

We got everything set up and a loud crunch came somewhere in the distance straight ahead of us in the deep woods. I confirmed that he heard it too and we both dismissed it. He lights the candles and begins doing his thing when we hear it again, but a good distance closer. At this point I’m getting a little freaked out as I wasn’t used to anything occult. I thought someone was messing with us until I heard a deep, guttural growl from behind us a fair distance.  The sun was just barely putting forth anymore light at this point, the only visible source being the candles. He began to feel uneasy as well so we hurried his ritual up and packed everything away. As we were about to leave, one more thick snap came from the woods right in front of us, maybe 20 ft down in the ditch. At that point we basically fast-walked our way out. 

We came back to check it out a few days later and a bunch of adult-sized trees were completely uprooted with huge gashes on the trunks. No footprints in the mud either. The last storm was maybe 2 weeks ago and these were freshly ripped out of the ground. 

I’m still not sure what it was to be honest. There are black bears in the area but I’ve never heard of one ripping up a whole tree. Spooky stuff though, looking back on it I find it amusing lol."
t3_f8p0z5,all_ads,I’ve had a lot of weird things happen to me: Dreams before Deaths,Thetruthishere,"Okay I’m so glad I found this subreddit because ever since I was a child I have had various odd encounters and now I finally have a place to open up about them and share. This post is going to be about very vivid dreams I have before the death of someone I know. 

I’m in college now but from the age of 9 through 17 I went to a music camp a few hours from my house in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. I loved it every year was magical and it was all thanks to a very old woman who owned the property with her husband since the 50’s. Anyways she was very elderly and her oldest son lived with her and he was also very old. 

He ends up passing away beginning of the semester in August from long term illness and complications. I didn’t know him very well he only conducted for the most advanced students who I wasn’t grouped with until my last few years. I can’t remember the days of the week exactly but for ease I’ll say I had a very long and difficult dream on Monday night. I can’t remember the details of it very clearly but I remember waking up in the middle of the night panting as if I had been holding my breath, hot, heart pounding, and a sense of dread so bad I had to turn my lights on just to be sure there wasn’t a maniac about to stab me. I manage to go back to sleep and continue my routine on Tuesday as if it hadn’t happened. I later find out Friday that he had died late Monday night/early Tuesday morning. It was sad news that hit but I also got hit realizing that I had woken up panicking the same night. 

Fast forward to winter break and I have a similar dream and wake up panting and gasping, hot, disoriented, and scared again. This time it was actually Friday morning around 2am cause I checked my phone to use the flashlight to scan my room and make sure I was safe. I go back to sleep and wake up to texts from friends in several different states who had gone to camp with me— the sweet old woman who had cofounded the camp had passed early in the morning. This time it hit even harder that I had the dream again. 

Last instance: I had a neighbor who lived across the street and over one house to the left who I’d seen as a kid but as I grew older I had started to forget what she looked like and her voice and such. This was after high school I was about 20 then and it had been years since I’d had any bad dreams like the ones I’d had with the camp founding family. Anyways it was summer and my mom comes in and asks if I’d be willing to help our neighbor since she’d recently had a stroke and her family was all out of state at that point and I had been looking bored and why don’t I just go do it. So I do and we have a blast and set up a routine. Every Monday I take her grocery shopping and every Thursday I go in and visit with her, cook, be generally silly it was honestly a highlight looking back at it. 

So I’m leaving Thursday and she says she’ll call me if she needs me Monday because some people had known about her condition and brought her food and goodies and she doesn’t know if she needs to shop again so soon. I go home and forget relatively soon she’d said anything like that. Then Saturday night I have another horrid dream and wake up as usual: panting, hot, scared. Now since it had been a few years since the last dreams at this scale I don’t immediately put it together but it’s the weekend and still summer vacation so I just kick my sheet off and finish my night. 

Then Monday rolls around and she doesn’t call and I remember that maybe she doesn’t need me. I let it slide I go out with friends that night. Then Thursday comes and no call to come over so I think maybe she’s got someone else or she’s tired or whatever. Next Monday rolls around and I get no call so I go over and ring the bell and call her phone and it goes to voicemail. She also keeps her car in the garage and has a fence that keeps you from going up the front door and knocking so I have no idea if the car is it isn’t there and I can’t peek into her living room or kitchen cause the locked fence. I go home and wait for Thursday which comes and goes with no news so I figure she’s “dumped” me and gotten an actual caretaker or something. 

It’s not till two weeks after I’d seen her last my mom breaks the news that while I was asleep she had seen the ambulance and police outside and they’d taken her body to a morgue. She had died two weeks prior when I had my last horrific dream from another stroke and had been in the house ever since till her son had come to check on her. I was the last person to see or speak to her alive. 

I’m sorry for such a long post but I needed to tell it as best I could. To anyone reading this have you had similar experiences? Would this be called premonition or clairvoyance? I’m only so dumbfounded cause I had very minimal relationships to the people I had these dreams with before their passing. With the exception of my neighbor. Any comments or questions I welcome fully. Thanks for reading"

Many things have been said on these subjects   indeed, and most of those things said include words such as “hogwash”,   “hullabaloo”, “smoke-and-mirrors”, “fraudulent”, and “bullshit”; these   select words have been said by both the common layman as well as his   academic counterpart, men of science, reason, intelligence, all of them   look upon ideas of magic and sorcery as bunk, fairy-tales for overly   imaginative children, to be given absolutely zero consideration,   recommendation, or investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you today that *this*   is bunk. This attitude is hogwash. This scoffing is hullabaloo. This   hand waving is smoke-and-mirrors. This judgement is fraudulent. This   assertion by so called men of science and reason that these aspects of   reality cannot possibly exist is utter bullshit; and today I shall prove   it to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Though, you must accept two caveats from the get-go.

1:   Forgive me, for I myself am not a powerful enough sorcerer to throw   your room into a sty to prove telekinesis, nor tell you what you are   thinking eleven times out of ten.

And 2: Fret not, for I can teach sorcery to you, and let you be the judge of your own ability.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First   and foremost, to practice magic you must believe in magic. The skeptic   may scoff, again, finding it silly that something must be believed in  to  be effective, but I would remind that skeptic that to achieve the   greatest feats in skill, athleticism, or genius, you must first believe   you can achieve them. No athlete would tell you with a straight face   that they perform well even if they don't believe they will; they   absolutely must have the right mentality for them to perform to   standard. It is no different with painters, musicians, architects, or   anyone who must chronically hit deadlines. To be successful they must   first be able to visualize their success coming to fruition, they must   believe they can do it, first and foremost, before they will be able to   do it. The Law of Attraction outlines this well, and if you do not know   what that is, the shorthand of it is as follows: The more you believe   something will happen, the more likely it is to actually happen. Not   just inside your body either, but outside, effecting the very world   around you. The idea that, if you just focus hard enough, you can   literally will things into existence, whether it is opportunities to   advance your position, resources in order to better yourself or status,   or more simple things like good luck, friendship, and love. 'The   Secret', a book by Rhonda Byrne, outlines this principle and how it   works perfectly, and while it first may seem outlandish, many famous and   exceptional people have themselves written about it, attesting to it,   and urging others to follow it; such obvious loons including: Plato,   Leonardo DaVinci, Galileo, Napoleon, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas   Edison, Einstein, and Andrew Carnegie, as well as being written about   and referenced either directly or indirectly in self-help books by Paulo   Cohelo, Charels Haneel, Wallace D. Wattles, and James Allen. All of  the  aforementioned believing the Law of Attraction having, at least, a   significant impact in their success, or at most, attributing their   successes to the law almost entirely, Mr.Wattles himself being one of   the biggest advocates for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Even   if you phoo phoo these old timers for their nonsense and obviously   nonsensical ways, you would do well to know that most famous and   overwhelmingly successful people living today have considered themselves   apprentices to this exact line of thinking and the books written upon   it. They believed in it with the weight of their life, and in return it   gave them their life.

&amp;#x200B;

This   fits perfectly into the next part of my theorem: The Placebo Effect.   When most people hear of the Placebo Effect, they think of sugar pills,   fake medicine, things doctors give patients to either check if they're   faking or to send them on their way without a fuss, but this is little   more than hear-say. In truth, the Placebo Effect is one of the most   interesting and deeply looked into phenomena's in medical science.

&amp;#x200B;

In   simple terms, those who believe themselves well become well, and those   who believe themselves sick become sick. How does this work? If the  body  can just 'make' itself well, why doesn't it? That's the mystery.  But  the fact remains, it has been proven time and again that patients  who  are given sugar pills or false serums and told that it will make  them  well not only become healthier, but even in tests where the  recipient is  *told* they are being given Placebo's, they *still* feel better; simply for the fact of having been given a pill by men in white lab coats in a pristine environment.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that I'm not talking purely about symptoms. These people don't just 'feel' better, they *get*   better. To quote Erik Vance, Biologist and author of “Susceptible  You”,  a chronicle of his own studies on the Placebo Effect, there are   numerous cases of the Placebo Effect alone healing such illnesses as   Parkinson's, Chronic Pain, IBS, Depression, Anxiety, certain types of   Asthma, and even Auto-Immune Deficiencies. Many medicines are just as   psychological as they are physical remedies, hence why the good doctor   always tells you this won't hurt a bit, because it's been proven time   and again that if he does not, it hurts far more.

&amp;#x200B;

It   is even worth noting that the act of Visualizing in and of itself has   been studied with extreme scrutiny, to the point where it's been   revealed that visualizing an action has the same effect on the brain as   physically performing an action (this is something many elite and   Olympian level athletes, including Emily Cook of the U.S Ski Team,   Lyndon Rush of the Canadian Bobsled Team, Al Oerter, four time Discus   champion, Billie Jean King, Tennis star, Lindsey Vonn of the U.S Alpine   Skiers, Manchester Football Players Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and   Andy Murray. Former Olympian Swimmer for the U.S team Micheal Phelps,   Boxer Connor McGregor, and even Muhammad Ali all attest to the power of   visualization as well. They did it nigh constantly, visualizing their   training, their strokes, their moves, and their techniques when taking   breaks from physical training. Sports Psychologists who look after these   same Olympians recommend it themselves, including Dr.Micheal Gervais  of  the NFL, Nicole Detling, for the U.S team, and Britt Tajet-Foxell  for  the Norwegian team).

&amp;#x200B;

And yes -- the Placebo Effect actually healing people HAS interfered with hundreds of studies for new medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To give this yet more basis in reality, the opposite is also true; colloquially known as the “Nocebo Effect”.

&amp;#x200B;

Some   time ago there was a study on something called “Hypersounds” -- noises   which are too loud to consciously pick up on, but when they press on   your inner ear, they cause rapid onset of headaches and migraines. The   thing is, they don't exist... or rather, the symptoms from them does   not. Yet many who participated in the study found they actually   developed the symptoms mentioned. Just as Placebos were discovered   through drug-trials where those given fake pills actually had their   symptoms and sickness alleviated, Nocebos were discovered by people   suffering the nasty side effects that come with many medicines -- the   very medicines they didn't take. Once more, it is worth noting this   wasn't just psychological phenomena. Nocebo's actually do hurt. They   have a very real, very physical effect on the body, including   inflammation, rashes, bruises, nausea, headaches, hosts of symptoms   associated with general sickness, depression, insomnia, difficulty   breathing, withdrawal, and even addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again one might scoff and try to disprove these studies by claiming   they are just cases of misattribution. Everyone can have a good (or off)   day, so when they have one whilst taking X drug (or fake drug), they   put blame on the drug. I will myself confirm that yes, this does happen,   but the Placebo Effect wouldn't be so popular or so deeply studied if   it were ALL cases of misattribution. In fact, Placebo's (and Nocebo's)   are so effective that it is estimated that upwards of 70%+ of all   recovery or degradation occurs strictly because of said phenomena. This   is not to say that medicine is largely useless, mind; only that any   medicine at all will be hard pressed to heal you if you are absolutely   convinced you will remain as sick as a dog, and likewise any sickness   will be hard pressed to keep you down if you are absolutely convinced a   good night's rest will make you chipper as a chipmunk.

&amp;#x200B;

To   make matters more confusing still, there are also “Placebo Blockers”.   If you are given a Placebo and told it will give you a rash, and then   secretly given real medicine which specifically reduces rashes, the   recipients had no or very minor rashes, compared to those who were not   given the Blockers. Likewise, if you were given medicine that actually   causes rashes as a side effect, and then given a placebo that mitigates   those symptoms, you would be in the same boat as the aforementioned,   having little to no symptoms despite their frequency in patients without   the Blockers.

&amp;#x200B;

In   either, any, and all cases, the bottom line is that it is the raw   belief that matters. The greater the conviction, the greater the   real-world effect. It doesn't even have to be just one person:   Mass-Hysteria, Mass-Psychogenic-Illness, Mass-Hypnosis, Mass-Psychosis,   and even that weird dancing plague that happened in Europe during the   14th-to-17th century are all related to Placebos, and all of them have   real, physical, bodily effects.

&amp;#x200B;

If seeing is believing, then here we can clearly deduce that the reverse is also true.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Which glides just perfectly into my next topic: Hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

Sufferers   of hallucinations will tell you outright that there is no fool-proof   way to tell when a hallucination is, in fact, a hallucination other than   the outlandishness of the situation, or how out of place the   hallucination might be. It is easy to know when you are hallucinating a   voice at 2 A.M when no one else is around, but there is no way to tell   when you are if you are walking through a crowded hall. It is easy to   know you are hallucinating an alien, but not so much if it is just a man   as like to any other. Indeed, those who have frequent or infrequent   hallucinations will tell you that they are not just sight and sound, but   can even be taste, smell, and touch. Hallucinations can, in fact, be   tactile, and you would be unable to tell which is which if you shook a   man's hand, so indistinguishable it would be from the regular sensation   of a handshake. Keep in mind hallucinations do not always overlap; some   are only auditory, while others are purely olfactory; yet they always *can*   overlap, and it becomes extremely distressing when it does; especially   when you learn that hallucinations can actually cause you pain. From   feeling the sensation of creepy-crawlies climbing up your back, to   suddenly feeling as if you had been pinched or pricked with needles, or   even the extremely distressing scenario of hallucinating a full blown   attack or mugging, where you can actually feel as if you've been   stabbed, though it is admittedly rare (with only a rough 20% of   hallucinations being tactile). The symptoms are similar to that of Sleep   Paralysis, wherein many sufferers report that sensations caused by the   hallucinations have a real and lasting effect on the body even after   fully waking (such as the pain of a compressed chest, being unable to   breathe, whilst hallucinating that an extremely heavy thing is on top of   you).

&amp;#x200B;

Phantom   Limb Pain is a similar issue, the feeling of pain and discomfort in a   limb that has been previously amputated; note: You are not feeling the   pain of the amputation, you are feeling as if the limb that is no  longer  there is, itself, in pain; as if you lit a match over an open  area and  your brain interpreted it as being held under your arm.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again this seems far-fetched until I remind you, dear reader, that you   yourself have likely hallucinated similar things when you dream; for   nearly all of us have had a dream that was chock full of sensations of   sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch that we could only imagine, such as   how it feels to fly, or something so beautiful it made us slack jawed.   So small are the amount of times we actually realize we are dreaming;   how strange, is it not? That no matter how surreal or fantastic   something is in comparison to our normal reality; our brain treats it as   if we walked out the door onto Jupiter for our regular Tuesday jaunt.

&amp;#x200B;

Always   keep this in mind: this, all of this you are experiencing right now,   none of it is purely a physical sensation. Even the pain we discussed is   a mental stimulation, not a physical one. It is your brain, not your   body, that tells you when you are hurt. Much like with dreams, I'm sure   you can recall experiences where a sudden sensation or shock causes you   acute pain for a moment before you realize you aren't actually hurt  (as  it has me), or the opposite, where you feel no pain until you look  and  see a wound on your body that you cannot recall receiving, and  suddenly  it begins hurting (as it has me). Pain is a mental  stimulation, but it  doesn't stop at the mere sensation of pain either;  cases of spontaneous  combustion, spontaneous wounds appearing on the  body, Stigmata (the  manifestation of religiously significant wounds on  the body), and even  the simple fact of an absurd amount of people going  online to talk about  wounds, whether scratches, bruises, fire, or even  acidic, appearing on  the body with no idea as to how they could have  gotten there, are all  recorded, yet under-researched and  under-examined. While it may be true  that a good portion of these cases  are faked, the mere fact that wounds  have shown up with no external  cause and seemingly no underlying medical  issue, simply because you  believe in it, is enough to raise a fuss.

&amp;#x200B;

But   this is all just conjecture, isn't it? This is all just hypothesis,   metaphysical, none of it is actually proven. So, I suppose I will have   to give actual proof, won't I.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Amou   Haji is a very interesting Iranian man. When interviewed about the way   he lived, he revealed that, as a young chap in his early 20's, he   encountered some 'emotional setbacks' which caused him to view the world   in an entirely different way than most, believing that being clean   causes sickness, and being dirty leads to health. Since then, he has   never showered, bathed, or cleaned himself in any way. He eats only   rotten meat (Entirely roadkill or the remains of any dead animal,   seemingly without any veggies at all), and drinks water only from his   rusted oil can. He's a chain smoker, alternating between smoking animal   feces from his large clay pipe, or regular cigarettes, five at a time.   He sleeps in a simple hole in the ground on the outskirts of his town  (a  village called Dejgah in the southern province of Fars), reminiscent  of  a grave, and for the harsh Iranian winters, wears only a metal  helmet  on top of his usual, never changing, rags to keep himself warm.  As  mentioned, he does all of this because he believes being dirty is  what  leads to health, and while his idea seems first laughable and  borderline  lunatic, you may want to give him more credit, for he has  lived this  way for over 60 years. Indeed, at the time of this writing,  Mr. Haji is  84 years old. You could doubt his claims that he has lived  this way  since early adulthood, but looking at pictures of the bloke,  it's easy  to see that if he's telling a fib, he and his village are the  most  dedicated liars on the planet. Yes, his village too, for all of  them  corroborate his story and agree that he has lived this way longer  than  many of them have been alive.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, the average lifespan for a male in Iran is 72. 72.5 if you really want to be a stickler.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?   What? How could this possibly be? People get sick of tetanus from a   splinter and die, and this man has been ingesting rotten, parasite   ridden food, rust from his cup, dirt in every orifice, blackening his   lungs from the constant smoking, never brushing his teeth, eating only   with his dirt caked hands, never so much as properly wiping his ass, and   he has never gotten sick.

&amp;#x200B;

He has never gotten sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Since   adopting this lifestyle, he has reported no sickness, nor has anyone  in  his village called him a liar. He has all his limbs, all his fingers   and toes, he is not blind, not hard of hearing, able to outrun the  grown  men who sometimes chase him to try to give him a bath, and is  seemingly  perfectly sound of mind (as sound of mind as most people  would regard a  man living in his condition, anyways), responding  reasonably and with  lucidity to any and all interviews given to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite   this disease-ridden lifestyle, he is untouched by it. Despite   everything our mothers tell us, our doctors tell us, our teachers tell   us, our biologists tell us, every single thing revolving around health,   nutrition, and wellness, he adheres to none of it, the exact opposite  of  all of it, and he has lived longer than most men and women in his   entire nation.

&amp;#x200B;

In   fact, he's lived longer than most men the world over. As of 2015 the   highest life expectancy on Earth for men is in Switzerland at 81.3.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no doubt he will live longer still.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why.   Why is he able to live like this for so long, still so robust in his   health, you may ask. Why, dear reader, haven't you been listening? It's   because he *believes* he is   healthy. He believes his lifestyle makes him the healthiest man alive,   and so he lives as stout as if he really were. His faith and conviction   are so strong in this regard that the Placebo Effect is unstoppable,   eradicating all sickness within him and keeping him in good shape,   greater than any average man of his age. Likewise, I have no doubt that   if he actually were forced to bathe, it truly would kill him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again, the skeptic would probably mumble something about him gaining  an  immunity from so many diseases through the harsh lifestyle with  which  he's lived...but wouldn't that prove my point anyways? That so  many have  died from sickness so little while he, such an old man, still  thrives  because he believes he will.

&amp;#x200B;

Are   you feeling like you're tipping on the edge of a precipice by now?   Don't worry, I'll toss you right into the abyss myself, for here we   examine physics and the defects of the human brain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The   Double-Slit Experiment is a very famous, and relatively obscure,   example of just how strange the universe actually is. You should do   yourself a favour and delve into it on your own time, both for how   interesting it is and for the fact that you will learn far more, but to   save time I will give you the jist of it: Particles behave differently   when being observed vs. when they are left to their own devices. In the   early 20th century, an experiment was done firing particles out of a   canon to see how they interacted with the environment (specifically to   see whether they behaved as a wave, hitting all areas with lower and   higher intensity, respectively, or as solids, hitting some areas 100% of   the time while avoiding others 100% of the time. They did this by   setting up a wall with two slits in it and set it between the shooter   and the backboard). It behaved as a wave, and some folks were displeased   with this result, believing it was because the particles, all being   fired at once, were interfering with eachother's course of direction by   bouncing off one another. They repeated the experiment, but this time   firing only one particle at a time, rather than in large bursts, and the   particles behaved...as a wave. No interference, through only two  slits,  it created a wave pattern, which would be similar to you  throwing a  tennis ball through one of two holes in the wall and seeing  the dent the  ball made off of the backboard as if it hit five separate  locations at  once, none of which in the direction you threw it in. The  physicists  concluded that the particles, being in super-position (that  is to say,  capable of doing multiple, seemingly contradicting things,  at the same  time), were actually bouncing off of themselves, thus  creating the  pattern. To see how they were doing this, the physicists  tried to  directly observe the experiment, only for the particles to  behave, well,  as particles. Throwing a ball through one of two holes  and seeing the  dent on the backboard in exactly the areas you threw it  in. The very act  of observing, measuring, trying to find out which one  it would go  through, collapsed the super-position, 'forcing' the  particle to have to  choose which slit to go through. If this all sounds  very confusing,  that's because it is. “Truth is stranger than fiction”  and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

To   better understand Super-Position, and the collapsing of it, I would   direct you to Shrodinger's Cat: A philosophical experiment regarding   this very thing. The idea being that, if you put a cat in a box with a   vial of poison that MAY break in five minutes, and close the box, that   cat is now in super-position. It is fully capable of 'being' either   alive or dead at the same time. The idea being, until you open the box   and see for certain, the possibility of the cat being either alive or   dead is equal; it is effectively both and neither. By opening the box,   you 'collapse' the super-position, 'forcing' the universe to choose   between whether the cat is objectively living or objectively dead.   Particles, because of their obeying the laws of quantum physics rather   than our regular type, are in a state of super-position that actually   ALLOWS them to do multiple, contradictory things at once; perhaps   equatable to hearing both the cat slump over dead and the cat tramp   around meowing, still alive. The particles behave as if there were   clones of it doing other things simultaneously, even though no such   clones exist. It is only when you observe the particles that they are   unable to do this, being only one, and thus behaving as if there were   only one.

&amp;#x200B;

This   is a very important thing to note, for despite having to do with   quantum physics, and thus obeying a set of universal rules we, as   giants, rarely have to worry about; it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt   that the act of participating in something, even if merely by watching   it, changes the way the universe, atoms, and our reality works. “You   cannot prove there isn't a very quiet elephant just outside of your   field of vision at all times”. It proves that reality is malleable,   being able to be shaped and molded depending on how you see it, or even   if you see it, or where you are seeing it from. This is compounded on   top of issues previously touched upon, of hallucinations, dreams, and   even phantom sensations. It will be compounded further still.

&amp;#x200B;

The   brain is imperfect, as everyone knows, but it is still more imperfect   than anyone knows. We trust our brains absolutely, only because we have   no choice, but whether in double-blind studies, tests, tricks, or  simple  party games and illusions we all so easily fall prey to, it is  shown  just how easily brains can err. Memories are nigh always wrong,  whether  rose tinted or altered in some way, hence why reports from  eyewitnesses  to crimes are so ineffective. Memories are not only wrong  but can even  be falsely implanted. People, whether due to increased  stress, peer  pressure, or repeated coaxing, can begin to form vivid  memories of  things that never happened so accurately that the same  synapses are  shown to fire off when thinking of them as they would when  recalling a  favourite childhood memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Your   eyes are riddled with blind spots, whether it's the dots you cannot  see  and your brain just automatically fills them in for you with what  it  believes ought to be there, or the fact that your eyes constantly  see  your nose and just phase it out. Hallucinations are easy to induce;  you  could do so by starring into a mirror in the dark with nothing but  a dim  candle flame and in about 10 minutes you will see all kinds of  odd and  silly things floating right behind you. The most glaring fault  is the  fact that everything you see is actually upside-down. Light from  above  you hits the bottom of your retina, and light from below you  hits the  top, meaning that everything below you would be seen as above  you and  everything above you would be seen as below you, but your brain  just  corrects it for you. We've already discussed the Placebo Effect  and  Hallucinations, and the implications it has on how your brain  interprets  the world around you, as well as the universe itself, which  depends  upon observation from this faulty brain to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I   tell you all this in order to prove that nothing is so concrete or  real  as we imagine it to be. Indeed, it is purely out of convenience  and  because we need SOME foundation to stand on that we treat the laws  of  the universe as we do, rather than as the mere suggestion that they   truly are, so often breaking down and changing when you grow too big or   too small, or get too close to a black hole; when you dream, your  brain  treats it as an alternate reality, but we also rely upon it to  tell us  what reality is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing   all this, I have a question to ask you. Knowing that needing to  believe  in something for it to work is a commonly accepted practice,  knowing  how many put such faith into the Law of Attraction, knowing the  Placebo  Effect causes real, measurable changes in the physical body,  knowing  that visualization has the same effect on your body as the  imagined  activity does, knowing that imagined hallucinations can  trigger the  exact same sensations as true-to-life stimuli, knowing that  the  interpretation of our reality is a mental process, and how faulty  our  mental processes truly are, on top of how faulty our reality truly  is,  knowing absolutely, with unshakable proof, that a firm conviction  is  enough to seemingly disregard commonly held laws of biology,  physics,  and nature, knowing all of this, I ask you one question.

&amp;#x200B;

If   I believed I held a fireball in my hands, to hear its crackling and   believe in it as I believe in the air I breathe, and you believed I held   a fireball in my hands, feeling the heat come off it as if it would   blister your skin and feeling the pain of its light searing your   retinas, and I lobbed it at you, what do you think would happen?

&amp;#x200B;

This   is magic, true magic, and the basis of all spell-work to follow. More   than being real as it is, with what we just discussed, it does not even  *have*  to be 'real' to have any  true to life effect. As a matter of fact, I  think at this point, it's  rather ridiculous judging something by how  'real' it is at all, don't  you think?

&amp;#x200B;

The old mystics wrote that with faith, one could move mountains. I don't know if they realized how correct they truly were."
t3_f8kayp,all_ads,Weird light in the sky,Thetruthishere,"I live in rural Manitoba, Canada where there is pretty much zero light pollution and tonight it’s totally clear out with no clouds and the stars are all visible. I was in my yard having a smoke looking at the sky when I saw a slow moving object which at first looked like a plane/helicopter as it seemed to be flashing. But then the flashing stopped and it was solid light, then after a few seconds it disappeared. I thought it had gone behind a cloud but then realized there weren’t any! A few seconds later it appeared again in a similar place to where I last saw it, then it just disappeared! I stayed outside in the cold looking to see if it would appear again but it didn’t. I see lots of things in the sky here like satellites, drones, planes, helicopters, balloons etc because it’s so clear but it definitely wasn’t any of those. It’s weirded me out!"
t3_f8kvvz,all_ads,I haven't slept in 20 days. F*cking aliens man,Thetruthishere,"02/02/2020 was the last night I laid down and got a good nights rest. For the past 20 days some kind of spiritual entity has been performing brain surgery on me. You can refer to my last post to see what I originally wrote about it when it began. 

And before anyone starts I agree sleep is highly important, but this thing is rejuvenating me overnight. It does something to my nose to breathe like you do when you're sleeping. Once or twice I even snored. I feel completely refreshed throughout the day.

I still can't communicate with it. Idk if its inter dimensional or extra terrestrial. Angel or Alien.Last week it had me open my eyes for half hr or so. When I tried to look in its direction the background of it would wave similar to if you were looking through heat. I tried to record it, but nothing showed up on tape. I suppose capturing moments of an entity operating outside my version of space / time is a little difficult lol.

It feels like brain surgery, but instead of pain its pleasure. The rare occasions there is pain its very mild. Usually a quick pinch. If I'm ever thinking negatively about anything in life, it always sends love vibrations or good feelings in general.

It comes to me anytime I start meditating. Usually within 5 minutes. It likes to play jokes. Usually when it arrives it pushes my head to the side and down really fast. A few times when I had spotify on it would start twitching my shoulders to the beat. I'll usually wait until it gives me some kind of okay to take a break. I kept thinking about food one day, and its signal was blocking my airway for a moment. I made a choking sound the burst out laughing. I imagined it calling me a fatass or something. 

It has a selection of surgery tools it uses. Most of the time its hovering around and using two small tentacle like arms poking different parts. It also uses a small chain saw type tool, a small Jack hammer type, heavy vibration wand, and a small hammer. It's only used hammer twice. It hits the top of the back half. Like a doctor would to your knee. Up and down then it moves to the right some and does the same until it reaches the opposite side. The first time it did this an electric shock would occur in a few spots it hit. Last night it filled the middle right side of my forehead with some type of liquid. I could it feel it pulsing the veins in the sides of my head as it was absorbed. Then it sprayed some down the top of my nasal cavity. It dropped down to the back of my mouth. It didn't taste like anything. 

I feel fucking awesome. Better than I ever haven. I'm not in mania. I operate fine throughout the day. I'm a delivery driver, and I'm dropping packages off 40 hours a week. If I'm not working or running errands then I'm meditating. If my son interrupts me I'll tend to him and get right back to it. I moved in with my mom after my incident last year. I told her what's going on with me last week. She put me in the hospital last year, but she's being supportive. She's worried about my sleep, but trusting since I'm acting normal. 

I got brain damage from taking psych meds for only a few months. This entity has healed the damage and then some. Even as I'm typing this it's hard at work. It pushed and held my eyes closed twice while typing this up. Last year a doctor diagnosed me with bipolar type one because I was in ""mania"". I believed him for a while, but they were dead wrong. Something else is going on and it won't be stopped this time. This is an on going process. I don't know what the final state of mind will be, but I'll keep you updated."
t3_f86zuc,all_ads,Has anyone summoned a demon,Thetruthishere,"I'm really curious. I believe it can be done (I'm religious, so if I can talk to a god why not a demon) I'd do it myself but.. eternal damnation and whatnot.
Will someone share a cool experience about summoning a demon?

Edit: Don't worry, I know better than to actually try it. I just wanted to see if it was doable and if I was right. Just like with the chicken blood and whatnot. I am definitely a follower of God and his son, Jesus Christ."

t3_f82sqn,all_ads,I think I blew a fuse in my brain,Thetruthishere,"A few nights ago I was released from jail (February 12th, 2020), no ride and it was pretty late. I was walking home and as I got closer to home I noticed that the moon seemed really close, didn’t really think anything of it figured it was a normal thing some people are always snapping really amazing pictures of it. Then the next day as I was leaving my house it was around maybe 5 or 6 so it was already dark outside I noticed that the moon was gone. So I say all that to say this, is it possible that a blew a fuse in my brain and I can no longer see what other people can see? Or is the moon really gone? I’m not sure where to put this, it’s a question but also an observation so I figured it kind of fits into strange happenings. But like I said, I may have blew a fuse mentally and can no longer see what other people see. Just due to all the stuff that’s been going on in my life I’m sure it’s possible."
t3_f87g2w,all_ads,Was this a false awakening or what?,Thetruthishere,"So basically a few years ago I was hanging out with my cousin at home, nothing unusual. We were inseparable back in the day. And she left to go home. Then I went to sleep and in my dream I saw her as a child, I believe she was wearing an outfit that I’ve seem her pictured in before. So I immediately call her and make sure she’s ok, and that she didn’t get in a car accident or anything. I tell her what happened and we talk about it for a bit and get off the phone. Completely normal. Then, I wake up. That’s the weird part. Literally everything I just mentioned was all a dream. When I tell you I was perplexed that I had been asleep that entire time. I just could not believe it. Usually you can tell you’re in a dream cause something completely outrageous will happen. But nothing was weird. Nothing. It felt unbelievably real. And I woke up for real and called her and told her about it. To this day I cannot figure out what the hell that was. There’s vivid dreams and then there’s...that. Time slip? False awakening? Idk. Never had anything like happen again."

t3_f7lvvy,all_ads,I felt it when my grandma died.,Thetruthishere,"This happened almost 9 years ago. My grandma had been battling pancreatic cancer for awhile, but no one knew her death was imminent. She was living at home with my aunt, spending her days laying on a lounge chair in the sun because that's what she liked to do.

I was working at my office job one day and chatting online with a friend when the weirdest feeling ever came over me. I got super dizzy and faint and the only way I can describe the sensation is that something was being pulled out of me. It was such a visceral feeling, but not painful at all, of something coming out of my torso/chest. I almost fell out of my chair. I immediately told my friend about it and was like, what the fuck just happened to me? Not 5 minutes later I got the call that my grandma had passed away suddenly.

I knew right away, with 100% certainty, that I had felt her die. Something left me, physically, and it's never happened before or since. It's really opened my mind about us all being connected and what could be beyond. I'll never forget it as long as I live."
t3_f7u7xy,all_ads,UFO Encounter In Marching Band,Thetruthishere,"Let me start by saying I'm pretty much a skeptic when it comes to this sort of stuff. I enjoy reading the stories posted here, but honestly don't believe the majority of them. That skepticism applies to my own encounter as well. Anyway, I've decided to go ahead and post this story here, and I'll let you all make of it what you will.

When I was in highschool, I played trumpet in our school's marching band. We often travelled around the state (Missouri) to compete in competitions. So my Senior year, which was in 2013, we were playing at a competition held in Columbia, MO, at Mizzou University. Our school had made into the finals, but we were going to be the last band to perform. This meant by the time we were warming up to go on, it was nearly 10:00 PM. Our band had a tradition of praying before every show. For those of us that aren't religious, we were allowed to sit out the prayer, and just be respectfully quiet. My friend (I'll just refer to him as ""Matt"". Not his real name obviously) and I were two of those who always sat it out. While everyone was praying, suddenly Matt tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed up into the sky. It was a clear...I want to say early November night, but I'm not completely certain on that. Anyway, when I looked up, I saw what he was pointing at. It was a set of three, very dull, sort of blurry lights, in a fixed triangle formation. It flew over us quietly, making no noise. As I watched it move in a, I believe South Western direction, I could actually make out a black silhouette itself in the shape of a triangle, the dull lights positioned at each corner. The lights never flashed, just stayed the same dull brightness, and kinda grayish color. After about 30 seconds, it was out of sight, since we didn't catch it until it was directly over head. Of course me and Matt definitely made it a talking point on the bus ride home. At the time I thought it was *weird*, but didn't think much of it. Fast forward to July of 2013. Matt and I had graduated in May, and were wanting to hang out before starting college in August. We decided to go camping at Table Rock Lake, which is a man-made lake, in southwestern Missouri, near the Arkansas border. I think in total there were four people. Myself, Matt and his gf, and another friend of ours. It was the second night of camping, and we decided to go for a swim at around 2 am. We didn't go out far, mostly just stayed near the shore. About an hour goes by, and I'm looking at the sky. It was a very clear night, and the light pollution was a lot less out here than in the city that we lived in, so the stars were beautiful. Suddenly, I see it again. The same object I had seen months prior in Columbia. For reference, Columbia is over 200 miles from where we were at. Again, it had the same three, dull lights, in a triangle formation, still just as silent. I pointed it out, and our group watched it as it flew over. Not sure of the direction this time though. As soon as it was overhead though, the waves in the lake picked up. The wake was as if a large boat was speeding past, but of course, there were no boats. At least not that we could see. Once it was out of sight, the waters calmed. We decided to try and go to bed after that. Since then, none of us have seen the object again. Course it's become a story we like to tell people."

t3_f7q28v,all_ads,"Need help — I have a feeling of being watched in my apartment, and an uptick in unsettling dreams of people watching me in my apartment",Thetruthishere,"For several months I have had a feeling of being watched from one particular spot in my apartment, from which my bedroom door can be seen. Every time I walk into my bedroom, I have this feeling, and as soon as I shut my door I have to physically shake off the heebie jeebies. 

I also have been having unsettling dreams (but not sleep paralysis) about different people outside my window looking at me (from a random hobo to a person I went on a few dates with to very specifically a 1940s era Chinese soldier who was not right outside by window looking at me, but was a short distance away and turned to look at me), to most recently (last night) a somewhat creepy (but didn’t feel malicious) black haired woman with black smeared eye makeup standing *in* my bedroom looking at me. 

Of note: when I moved into my new place, my roommate’s friend (a psychic and medium by trade) said that my vintage easy chair (I picked it up off the street a few years ago and had professionally steamed cleaned but that’s it) was haunted by a person who had died of cancer. They said that they and my roommate performed some cleansing and the person left.

The dream last night of the woman in my bedroom coupled with my roommate’s cat tracking something and meowing in the spot from which I feel watched tonight are leading me to ask for help. 

I have tried smudging with sage once by myself and once with my roommate but the feeling persists and the dreams are getting more unsettling. 

I live in Los Angeles (a psychically sad city IMO)  if that helps."

t3_f77bj6,all_ads,"My grandad, with non-communicating Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, speaks before passing.",Thetruthishere,"My grandad was diagnosed with Parkinson's and then Alzheimer's approximately four years prior to his passing at 78 years old. For the year prior, he lost his ability to walk, use his arms and talk, acknowledge those around him and respond to his environment. Basically his soul was trapped inside his body, watching us all but unable to speak to us. 

My nan became his sole carer, they set up a harness system in the home to move him from room to room for showering/toilet, bed and lounge room time. She would bathe him, feed him and anything else he needed. She vowed to be by his side until he died. They shared a bed their entire life and that never changed even when he was sick.

One night, prior to his passing something eery happened. My nan was doing her usual routine of reading a newpaper to my grandad (as it was his favorite thing when he was able to read). Out of nowhere my nan was overcome with an eery feeling. She wasn't sure what this was.
A few minutes later my grandad spoke... he turned his head, looked at her and said ""I love you Shirley"". 
In disbelief my nan said ""ken? Ken? What did you say?"". That was all. He then stopped eating, refused food and died within a week in his favorite arm chair.

He never visiaully recognized anyone during his last year, so for him to look at nan and also speak was a miracle. I believe his internal spirit was able to over power the disease to communicate one last time before passing and becoming free. 
My nan cherishes this moment and I am thankful it happened. I think she feels valued for being there for him and not putting him in a home. They will be reunied one day, and he will be there for her ❤"
t3_f7flcc,all_ads,Black-eyed Kids and Wendigo,Thetruthishere,"This happened to a friend of mine, so it's not my own story. Wanted to share because of it's strangeness.

This story happened to me about 12 years ago. I was around 24 at the time. I worked hospitality so it’d be later at night when my friends and I hung out. So, at around 9 o’clock my friend and I decided to go for a drive, someplace we’ve never been, just get in the car and go. I offered (and wanted to) drive because my mother was out of town and I was using her Mercedes. It was one of those early 90’s E bodies, the ones that were big piles of heavy steal, a real tank of a car. I only mention the car body because it becomes relevant later in the story. He happily agreed and we hit the road. 

We lived near Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the time. Good ole Wisconsin where you get a lot of really good stories out of I’ve noticed, it seems to be a pretty paranormal state. Either way, we drive north out of the city and drive for about an hour when I see an exit I don’t recognize and decide to get off there. There was nothing at this exit other than corn fields, no gas station or restaurant signs, no visible light of a town in any direction. So we are in a place we don’t recognize but that was the point, just driving to get nowhere because the speed limit was 35  and we were in no rush. The moon was out enough that everything was pretty visible. About a mile into the cornfields, we could see 2 kids on the right side of the road. We comment on how weird it is because there is no housing or stores or even lights on a horizon, plus it was 10:30ish at night. Naturally were two larger guys so we don’t worry about anything so I slow down so we can inquire if their car broke down or if they were ok. 

As we pulled up, I noticed the kid in fronts clothing. It was a stained cream colored tweed type shirt with real tattered sleeves and overalls with only one strap. He appeared to be maybe 12-years old. The second kid was taller wearing a red flannel type shirt, with old times looking khaki pants. However, I could barely notice the taller kid standing further behind the smaller one because as I pulled up noticing the clothes, I got to see the whole “child” fully and his arms were to his side slightly raised, almost in that iconic zombie way. But his eyes, I couldn’t take my eyes off of his, and I did my best to mutter to my friend “you’re seeing this too right?”. His eyes were pitch black, blacker than the night, but easy to see as he stood there staring at us. I did not know what the heck I was seeing but I’ve never been so frightened in my life and I’ve had several odd experiences that have left me unable to deny that there is more in this world than what we understand. So we’re stopped for a moment locking eyes with whatever this thing was, it was no child, it was evil, I have zero doubts of that. We quickly agree to go, and fast. We are not going to inquire with them, this was straight out of twilight zone, and I remembered the hitchhiker and that was not happening tonight no sir. So, we go and we clamor between ourselves “what the $#@&amp; did we just see, what was that what the hell was that!”. Still no signs of homes, just open corn fields. How these 2 kids could be there, I don’t know but I believe those were not kids. 

So I keep driving, and we get out of the fields into a wooded windy road shortly after probably around 5 minutes. Here in Wisconsin there are random historical markers displaying in whatever year this happened information. I only mention that because I passed one on the curve so I glanced at that, As I’m driving through a curve going about 45mph a creature walks in front of my car (my moms car)… As I saw it, it was nothing like I ever saw, it’s spine was tall, it stuck above the hood ornament as I hit it. It was a grey color and looked like nothing I’ve ever seen. It had a very tall arch in its spine, almost like when a cat hisses and goes on its toes, that kind of shape but in a very tall gangly creature. I hit this thing straight on with the tank of a Benz. My friend is freaked out at this point as am I to say the least. I stop immediately, but now we’re both a bit scared from the children of the corn, and now this thing literally within minutes of one another. We decide getting out is not going to happen, but I decide to stay in the locked car but use the car and it’s lights to see what we hit and make sure of whatever the hell it was is dead and I needed to know what I just saw. I drive in tiny circles backing up and forwards looking for this creature but after checking every inch within 100 yards and not seeing a thing including not a drop of blood where I hit it, straight on with a Benz, making contact with its spine, body, and head anywhere. That was unnerving and although I wanted to check my mothers car, that would be dealt with further down the road. We were not going to get out there. So we decided to head home at this point. 

15 minutes later before I got back to the freeway and I needed to get out and see how bad the car was. As I got out to check, quickly as I was not taking chances tonight, I noticed my grill was busted in but nothing too bad. So I made sure it was secure and got back in as quickly as possible, my friend decided to stay inside the car. Recently, I heard of the black eyed kids and freaked out a little bit. I did not know that they were a real thing, I thought I just saw a couple demon kids or damned ghosts or I didn’t know what to think. To this day, I’ve looked through tons of photos of supposed cryptid beasts and mythological creatures looking for what I hit, and the closest I’ve found is some Algonquin drawings of Wendigos and they were very close to what I believe I saw and hit that night. It seems to me very odd both things could happen so close to one another to not be related.

Possibly it was an evil area, or possibly a Ley line, I don’t know. 

I would like to point out I’ve lived in Wisconsin a long time and it was not a deer or a coyote or anything else. What I hit, was nothing native to the known Wisconsin landscape, and neither were those horrid kids. I will never forget either of those faces and just hope I never come across them ever again."

t3_f7kwtp,all_ads,Beings with Orange Eyes in the United States,Thetruthishere,"I saw two beings with orange eyes that are meant to be illusioned away and not seen by humans. The first I met at a Verizon mobile center which drove around outside outlets to avoid detection from humans. He looked around my age- early twenties, and he had the most beautiful orange eyes I didn’t know could be a trait. He looked at me as if he’d like to recruit me for the mobile job. Then he thought I had seen his eyes with the look of awe in mine.

&amp;#x200B;

The second being with orange eyes I came across was a man working at a job I also did that allows top-secret privileges. His eyes were a gorgeous orange, but not as bright as the previous man and I only saw through it for a few seconds before the illusion went back up. He thought I was psychologically different from our coworkers and he had hopes to bring something from this job back to his people- the citizens of his race."
t3_f6wygh,all_ads,My grandpa came to ‘get’ my grandma,Thetruthishere,"So my grandparents were together many many years. My grandma was 16, grandpa was 21 when they got married. My grandpa passed away July 2018. At the age of 98. So 2018-2019 was my grandmothers first year without him in a really really long time. I don’t think I heard her laugh once. She stopped eating and would make herself throw up any food she did manage to get down. She didn’t talk much. She lost SO MUCH weight she was literally a shell of former plum, (relatively) healthy self. 

In August of 2019, one evening, my grandma was with her carer in her living room where they usually sat. And she told her, could you get up so baba (this means father in Swahili. She called him baba because not only was he such a caring and loving father to their kids, he was also very nurturing to her as his wife) can sit there in his chair? Obviously her carer was confused and just concluded that she was a little deluded. The next morning, she came into my grandmas room and my grandma was like “baba was here last night. He was walking around and that’s why I asked you to get up for him”. Her carer was like ok sure sure. Then she (grandma) said could you please bring me my rosary. I’d like to pray for you. So carer brought the rosary and she prayed for her and thanked her for everything she does for her. The day continued on as normal.
The next morning after she’d had a shower and dressed up in fresh clothes, she sat down in her favourite chair in the living room and peacefully passed away.


I thought it was just a testament to how deep and beautiful the bond between them was. They really really cared for one another and it’s like he came to get her."
t3_f77a1l,all_ads,My boyfriend helped his mom out when she was trying to figure out how to keep his Spotify account open.,Thetruthishere,"My boyfriend passed away at the age of 26 after a 10 month long cancer battle on Jan 15th, 2020. Since his passing, his mom has been doing her best to get all of his affairs such as his bank account, subscriptions, and reoccurring payments like his car settled out.

Her and I were at their home alone. I was hanging out in his bedroom, packing my stuff to prepare for moving out after living there while he was going through his illness. She wanted to deactivate his Spotify account so it wasn't taking his money every month anymore. She later found out that if you close someone's Spotify account, it will erase all of their music and the playlists they made. We didn't want his stuff to get deleted because he made special playlists for me during our relationship, and when his family and I listen to the music he loved, it makes us feel closer to him. So she decided she will just put her credit card info onto his account so that it will just remain as it is.

She came in to ask for help because she was unfamiliar with how to use his iPhone. She wasn't able to find a way to change the payment info through the app, so I told her that she could most likely do it online. A few minutes later she came back in to his room to ask me about his log in information for his account. She said that [Spotify](https://Spotify.com)'s website kept saying that his email that she was trying to use to login didn't exist in their system. My boyfriend was always super organized too, and would always put his login info for all of his different accounts on a spreadsheet in his notes on his phone. But for some reason the only one that wasn't there was his Spotify account.

Neither of us really knew how to access his account at this point, we just guessed he had used an old email address that he didn't use anymore when he made his Spotify. She started looking on online forums to figure out how to solve this and I just continued packing.

Then she came back in and said ""Ok this is super weird!"" and she had a super wide-eyed expression. And I asked what happened, and she then told me to follow her into her bedroom where her computer was. She told me that after she was done reading the forums, she was advised to go onto Spotify's website and try using the 'I forgot my email or password' tool. So she typed ""[spotify.com](https://spotify.com)"" in the search bar and once the page was opened, his account was already logged in! Mind you that this specific computer that she was using was a super old desktop that my boyfriend had never used, at least not within the passed few years. Not only that but, she was on Spotify's login page minutes before she reopened it and he wasn't logged in before. And also, even if he did use that computer to login to his account at some point in the past, there's no way it would have stayed logged in for that long, it would have been done at least a year before this day.

She then went ahead and changed the credit card info. And just to test our theory, once she did that she closed the page without logging out, and then restarted the browser and went back on to Spotify and lo and behold, he was now logged out.

His mom and I couldn't stop smiling while also feeling overwhelmed with how crazy this was. We truly believe he was helping her. I told her that he must feel pretty good about our decision to keep his music and playlists around, and that he wanted to help her out cause she always had a hard time figuring out how to use technology. I miss him so much, his strong spirit makes it a little easier when dealing with him being gone."
t3_f7ftip,all_ads,"Four “paranormal” activities, four different years, same country.",Thetruthishere,"I grew up in the states, I was raised here but my parents have different ethnic backgrounds. My mom has a Tunisian background, which is a country in North Africa. Every summer vacation, my mom and my two brothers would go to Tunisia because she wants to go see family there. My dad stays in the states to work and take care of things while we are gone. Anyways, after a couple of summer vacations, I learned the country. Their traditions, the roads, stores, how to act, how traffic works, how to cross streets with no stoplights, etc. so I know the country pretty well. My first experience was around 4 years ago when I was maybe 11-12, I don’t exactly remember but I’m 15 now and 4 years ago must have been around that age range. I’ve never had ANY experiences in the US and only in Tunisia. My mom had a house that we would go to every summer, it had a master bedroom where she and my two younger brothers slept. I slept in the living room because the extra rooms had way too much stuff in them. The house was pretty small, it was a one story with the living room pretty much facing the rooms, you can see all three rooms clearly from the living room. All three doors were closed, my mom and brothers were already long asleep and I was drifting off when I heard a door open. The doors were fully wooden and they creaked very loud when opened, so I looked up and all the rooms were still closed. No open doors, nothing. Hm, weird. I thought I was probably just imagining things because I’m so tired so I lay down, and again, the creaking door sound, this time it was clear and loud. This time I stand up, yet again no doors are open. I go to the bathroom and washed my face to wrap my head around what was going on, I was pretty young so I didn’t know how to react. Once I left the bathroom, heading back to the living room, my room door was wide open. It freaked me out, I closed the door and was scared to ever go in that room after that. I think I might have told my mom but I don’t remember. Nothing happened after that night, the next year, I went over to my grandmothers house, her house was bigger and more modern because she actually lived here. I went to spend the night, I was in the extra room on my phone at around 2 am when I heard some weird sound that sounded like it came from the wall, it kinda sounded like an insect but a very weird version and it got louder and louder. It wouldn’t stop so I woke my grandma and she heard it too but said it was probably some kinda cricket in there. It didn’t sound like a cricket though it was a very weird sound , it went on all night but the next morning it was gone. I recorded it a long time ago but it was on my old phone and it is deleted, I'll tell you this though, it definitely was not an insect. Again, for the rest of the vacation, nothing happened. The third year, I was having a sleepover with a couple of friends. There is a room at the back of the house, pretty far from the living room. This room was an extra room and has a backdoor to the outside of the house leading to the backyard. Anyways, they didn't have a netflix account in Tunisia so I had to login with my account. We all sat down with blankets and were chilling but once we started watching a movie thats when I realized that I forgot my glasses in that extra room. When I got up and went to the room, the room door was wide open and the lights were open. and I am 110% sure that I locked the room door and closed the lights because they had a german shepherd that we didn't want in that room. I was the last one out that room earlier and I promise you I locked it and closed the lights. It was none of my friends because I was the only one who left the living room and they didn't have the keys to the door. It also could not be anyone else from the outside because the backdoor that I mentioned earlier was also locked and barricaded so no one can enter from outside. To this day, I have no explanation to what that was about. The fourth and final one (Last summer) happened when I was home alone and my parents were at a wedding ceremony. We had no AC and it was very hot so I opened some windows up. I decided to play on my phone since I just jailbroke it and was trying out the new features and watching YouTube. Suddenly, I hear faint screams coming From outside the open window, it sounded like the type of screams from a rollercoaster but the closest amusement park is about 120 miles away. It was young girls and guys screaming but it was faint. Faint, but clear. The direction it came from was nothing but sand and trees and nothing for miles and miles upon end. I was on my phone so I recorded it, and you can hear it so it wasn’t part of my imagination. The video could be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mysteries/comments/cc0ek4/on_vacation_to_tunisia_it_is_really_hot_and_there/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as usual, nothing happened for the rest of that night or the vacation.

Sophomore year of college I was playing Ouija board with my friends. We had a spell out for Faust as the person behind the board. We each asked a question in our heads. I asked silently in my head, “What am I looking for in Japan?” The board quickly replied H O P E. There was no way my peers could have known what I had asked, but this was the perfect answer for my study abroad. While he was on the board I kept hearing his thoughts about which of us was the prettiest and who he preferred.

Later that night I had a dream that Faust was down the hallway in my dorm and he had a present for me. It was extremely vivid and I started walking down the hallway. When I reached him I felt attracted to him, but a hidden danger underneath. I saw the present in the right hand corner of the room, but I was only interested in him. He asked me to kiss him and right as I was I woke up knowing God had woken me up to prevent the consequences of kissing him."

t3_f7bik1,all_ads,My house might be haunted idk rly. Help?,Thetruthishere,"Hello Reddit, I think my house (specifically my brothers room) is haunted. Before I start let me say sorry if my English is bad if from Serbia and it’s my second language and if my formatting is bad I’m on my phone.
First let me explain the layout of my house ,there is no fence because wall of the house is on the street (if that is how you say it) so you could knock on windows from street ,as you enter our house , in front of you is a big mirror in a hallway left of the mirror is my brothers room ,left to you is mine and on the right is “main room/living room” with a kitchen and through glass door you can enter our backyard with a garage and a little place with a bbq.

Now that we got that out of the way we can start .
This story will be in 3 parts :
The feeling
The dreams
The bird
I think this will be a long one so yea tnx if you read it.

The feeling 

My family and I moved into this house in early 2015 and ever since then my brother and I have this feeling of being watched,but that’s not all of it ,
Every time I’m going to my room , as I walk through the hallway I have a feeling that something/someone is behind me and if I don’t hurry up it will catch me and kill me and I’m too afraid to look back ( I’m a 18 yo m that is not easily scared). and there is this sence of fear every time I’m about to turn the lights on in the living room. 
But I use to put this all aside because I used to think i was paranoid because of the new house but 5 years passed and the feelings didn’t go away or anything.

The dreams

I will begin this part by saying that my brother is a sleep walker ever since we were kids so I’m used to that staff but his dreams (and some of mine) are the thing that’s making me feel in safe In my house. 
He said that he has dreams about animals and animal like creatures usually trying to hurt him or covered in blood. 
One that scared me the most is the one that I witnessed. He said that in his dream a head of a boar was above him with blood all over him and that he woke up and jumped from his bed all across his room (I saw all this because I was in his room on his laptop doing homework). I was shook and asked him what happened and he told me and said that ever since we moved in he has that type of dreams so he’s used to it. But now let us talk about one that scared my for life and the main reason I can’t look through the glass door in my living room.
I’ve dreamed of a lady in red with blond hair I looked at her trough that glass door she just stood there in the low mist until she noticed me.
She turned into this devilish creature and started to run at me I ran back to my room jumped in bed and coverd myself with my blanket that I had since I was 3 yo. 
Then the feeling stoped and I guess I woke up in a sitting position coverd and was to afraid to uncover my head to see if she is there bukv I did it , I peaked and she wasn’t there. 
After that I had dreams where she would just stand in my dreams , normal dreams but she would be in everyone just standing and watching me . I thought nothing of it until my brother told me had a nightmare about a evil lady in red... that shit scared me and made me almost cry. 
Now I see her only from time to time in my dreams. 

And now finally 

The bird

This is a sad and a short story about how one of my pet birds died.
We had 3 parrots as pets 1 cockatail and 2 budgies that are in my brothers room.
One night my brother stayed up late and I had already been in my bed half asleep when all of sudden my brother comes into my room and tells me to come and look at one of the budgies. Because of the fear in his eyes I did and what I saw scared me,the little bird had been hanging from the top of the cage paralyses blinking and breading but completely paralyzed we took him from the cage and looked on the internet for what can cause bird-paralysis and main factor is fear so I asked my brother what happened and he told me that he felt like he is being watched and at that moment all 3 of birds started screaming and flying in the cage and hitting walls of that same cage .
He jumped out of the bed and turned the light on uncovered the cage and saw the same thing I did. 
I did some research and I read that birds can feel danger and then they panic and start screaming. 
This happened about a month ago and since then I feel even more scared in my house.

And yea few times I saw a black figure in my room and woke up with a scratch on my arm not a big one just a small one so I didn’t think much of it but it might mean something.

Well that is all of it I don’t know if this fits here but I’m looking for some kind of explanation about all this and if you read the whole thing tnx you.
Love y’all and be safe."
t3_f732mr,all_ads,My Mom can smell death,Thetruthishere,"So from what I was told by my Mom, this started to happen about a year and half, maybe 2 years ago. My Mom can smell death. I know it may sound weird but every single time she mentions the intense smell, someone dies within that same week.

My Mom describes the smell as sulfur then when I ask her if she’s sure it’s sulfur, she says “it’s like the smell of cremation.” My Mom has been in the food industry for 18 years. After, she retired that life and became a Nurses Aid. She works in assisted living with many elderly folks. Dementia, Alzheimer’s and just your normal senile old people. She loves them all. Treats them like family and even tells them she loves them before they go to bed.

Over the years, the sense of smell has gotten stronger and impossible to ignore. My Mom believes in God, prays and is an overall great human being. I swear to you, no matter what, when she smells death — it happens. It’s usually distant relatives, semi-close friends or her patients.

Has anyone experienced this? What is your take on it? I feel for her because when she starts to smell it, she genuinely looks sad and she says a prayer that whoever it is, doesn’t suffer."
t3_f76zk9,all_ads,I ran through a Doppleganger apparition running directly at me,Thetruthishere,"So every morning I give myself about 10 minutes to wake up then head out for a run. Because I usually work an early shift, my morning runs occur while it’s still dark outside, which is made even worse by the lack of lighting in the neighborhood I run though. One morning, lost in my own thoughts, I blinked and an apparition that looked exactly like me appeared before me and like a mirror version of myself ran through and behind me. The thing is, I don’t know if the figure had been running at me for a while and I just didn’t notice because I was lost in my own thoughts or if it just suddenly appeared. All I know is I blinked my eyes and suddenly a phantom Doppleganger appeared before me. It was too dark and it happened too fast to observe the figure too well, so I couldn’t gauge its attitude. Now, I assume what happened was merely a result of being half-delirious given I had just woken up. I’ve also taken psychedelics a few years ago and while I haven’t experienced any post-trip hallucinations, I’ve become more fearful of subtle changes in my sensory experience. For example, if I notice something in my peripheral vision move, I’ll register the movement and reflexively attribute it to something paranormal before realizing the motion was a car rolling down the street, a soccer ball being kicked, etc. Given all these qualifiers, I’m still curious if anyone’s has ever had an experience similar to what I’ve described above?"
t3_f72jpx,all_ads,a strange encounter that changed my life,Thetruthishere,"I am writing this post because I was told my story suits well in here. Sorry for my English, I am Italian and English is not my first language.
Everything that I’m telling you now happened a couple of summers ago, I was 17 and I used to ride my bike anytime I needed to go somewhere because I did not have a driving license. At the time I was always scared, I used to carry a swiss knife because I never felt safe during those years, like something was going to happen, maybe too many movies who knows lol.

One day, around 11 pm I was hanging out with a friend (a guy I know since elementary school), I am into photography so I was always carrying my camera and lenses, that day I shot some pictures as usual and then when it was getting late me and my friend split up, he went to his home and I was headed to mine. The distance between our houses is less than a km. 

I was riding my bike when a car came behind me, that’s kinda normal, when it happens I lower my speed and get to the side of the road and wait till they overtake me, but this time something is wrong, this guy is driving like a maniac revving and using high beams and it seems like he’s trying to scare me and run me over, I immediately try to protect my self and I decided to outrun him, so I start to ride as fast as I could, the guy was driving a white old bmw 5 series, a car I have never seen in my neighborhood.

I was so hyped and I decided to take a sharp turn right into a wrong way street, I thought that going back to my house wasn’t the best idea because he would have found out where I lived, I also had my expensive gear so I really wanted to run.

Here comes the strange part, I was so scared and full of adrenaline that I continued riding my bike for almost 4/5 blocks and I quickly reached my city centre square, the guy in the white car couldn’t take the wrong way street and he lost me. It was a summer night and people were enjoying the night, some guys where sitting in a bench and a bar was open. As I got to the city square I stopped, I was exhausted, almost everybody looked at me probably thinking “wtf is wrong with that guy”.
Like immediately a girl came at me from the bar, she was a waitress and she asked me if I was ok, she clearly asked me who he was (the guy that tried to run me over) and it was like we knew each other from school or something, she was familiar. I was shocked and I said that I didn’t know who he was, she took me to the bar and she gave me some water. Then I got out of the bar, took my bike and I immediately came back home (because I was really scared and all I wanted was to be at home). As I was riding I realized that what has just happened was pure illogical, she immediately helped me as soon as I got the bar and it was like she knew I was coming there, she knew about the crazy guy in the white car and she looked like someone I knew. I continued riding back home thinking about what happened and I felt really alive that night, I was riding my bike so fast and I felt relieved. When I got home I wasn’t scare anymore and I didn’t feel unsafe anymore. I didn’t speak to my parents because they were sleeping so I got to bed and I slept well all night.

The next day I was happy, but I found out my swiss knife was gone, I know for sure that I had it with me the night before, I asked my parents and my sister but they didn’t take it. It was vanished. I never told anybody neither my friend who is really skeptical when it comes to stuff like this, I also consider myself a skeptical, but still I haven’t found answers to my story.

I never found out what happened, never saw the girl again, neither that white car. One thing only changed: I wasn’t scared anymore and I didn’t need a swiss knife anymore because I felt like I was born again."
t3_f6yi8x,all_ads,The most haunted house I've ever been in...,Thetruthishere,"I had posted this originally in another paranormal sub, but I didn't like my original title...

This happened a few years ago when. My mom was renting a very large 4 bedroom house in the country and everyone who saw it was really amazed that she was only paying $800 a month. It had a huge living room, a den, a massive kitchen and each of the four bedrooms were abnormally large. On top of that, it had an eight acre field and a little guest house.

I was going to college at the time and I'd just come over to visit my mom and play with my three younger siblings. The first weird occurrence happened when I was playing tag with the kids in the field outside. It was getting dark and all of the sudden we heard some loud chanting. No one was around, but the chanting got louder.

Suddenly we heard the thundering of hooves headed our way. We ran back towards the house thinking stampeding horses were going to crush us. When we turned back, there was nothing. A week later I was at the house and I noticed my little sister playing in the corner and laughing. She started talking to someone who clearly was not there.

I asked her who she was talking to and she said ""My friend Keifer. He's dead."" The moment those words escaped her mouth, my mom's bookshelf collapsed, knocking every book to the floor. A few days later, my mom called me. She was frantic and upset.

My sister claimed that during the night someone was trying to grab her through the bathroom window. I drove over and helped look around the property for anyone hiding. I spoke to my sister and asked her to show me where she saw the person. She said ""It wasn't a person, it was a white angel face and it came from there!"" She pointed to the reflection of the window in the bathroom mirror.

A week later things got worse. I went over to the house when no one was home to use the computer. The second I walked through the door, the radio turned on and ""Eminence Front"" by the Who was playing...right at the ""Welcome to the party dressed to kill."" Part. I felt queasy, but I needed to work on my finals, so I shut off the radio and went to the computer.

About twenty minutes later, I heard the bathroom door slam and the toilet flushed three times. I went into the hallway and made sure all the doors were closed and ignored the whole thing. A few minutes later it happened again. The bathroom door opened and closed and the toilet flushed three times. I searched the whole house at this point. I was alone.

I was shaking, but I was a young, dumb twenty something and wouldn't take a hint. I kept working on the computer and tried to ignore what happened. The door slammed again and the toilet flushed three times once more. I got up and closed the door and yelled ""Fuck you! You can't scare me, you piece of shit!"" Big mistake.

I went into the living room and I heard all of the doors slam and then I heard heavy, soggy footsteps coming through the kitchen right toward the living room. I ran out the front door and ran around the house to where my car was parked. I looked up at the kitchen window and I saw the silhouette of a very tall figure standing in the kitchen window. It was solid black, like a shadow.

I got the hell out of there. Later in the day, my mom called me, pissed off that I tracked muddy bootprints all over the kitchen floor. I told her what happened and she freaked out. She saw bootprints before, but blamed my step dad.

The last incident was the scariest of all. A bunch of meth heads rented the little guest house on the property and my mom thought that they were going to break in so she set up a video camera that pointed from the living room to the backdoor in the kitchen. She later called me telling me that she wanted me to see the tape. We were both in the den watching the video of the kitchen. The bathroom door in the hallway can me heard creaking open and soggy footsteps can be heard loudly. The tape turns staticy and when it clears up, a tall shadow like outline of a person can be seen walking past the kitchen table. I noticed it had no visible legs. The figure tilts its head and turns toward the camera and the whole image turns to static. My mom and I both yell out in disbelief and then a loud, guttural laugh comes from the hallway.

A month later, my mom and step dad decide they've had enough and they are moving. On the day of the move, I saw the landlord and I asked him about the house. He said that it was once a care facility for children with special needs. Each room used to be divided in half so it actually had eight small rooms instead of four big ones.

One day a caretaker was bathing a child in the bathroom when the kid had a seizure. The caretaker panicked and ran for help, when he returned, he discovered the child had drowned. He was fired. Feeling guilty, the caretaker snuck into the house and slashed his wrists in the very same bathtub. He was found in the water with his boots on. I don't know the validity of the landlord's story, but it explains everything we experienced in that freaky house.

NOTE: This was in 2004, and my mom had moved about  three times after all of this occurred. She does not have the video anymore.  I wish we did, because it is a crazy story and some people will just not believe it. That's fine."
t3_f6p7gu,all_ads,My sister seen my dead dad two weeks before she died.,Thetruthishere,"Before I start, I'm going to say this is all really fucking crazy. Some people may not believe it, but this is all very true. 

My family moved into a house in Swartz Creek, Mi in 2004. It was my dad Ronald, my mom Sharlotte, my sisters Shyra and Chelsey, my brothers Ronnie and Dillon, and I. My name is Sabreena, I'm now 22, this all happened between the ages of 9-11. 

Everything was fine until I think like 2007. My dad started getting super sick and jaundice, basically his skin and the whites of his eyes were turning yellow. His mom came over and they were searching online trying to figure out what could be wrong with him and the only thing that would come up was articles on cancer. He got checked out at his doctors, and lo and behold, he had an aggressive form of pancreatic liver cancer. My dad was super healthy before all of this so it was a huge shock. A few months later my sister Shyra (my username is named after her) started to get sick as well, and she was diagnosed with Hodkin's Lymphoma, which is a form of cancer as well. Really long story short, (if you want to know more you can google the city and our names to read some news articles as to how they got sick ect, it's pretty fucked up) My dad ended up passing away 2 years later on March, 27, 2009, but it was only after my sister went into remission because he told her that he wasn't going to die if she was sick. 

After his passing, my other older sister Chelsey moved out of state to live with my uncle James in Washington state. 


So fast forward a bit, at this point my dad had been passed away for nearly 6 months, Shyra (the sister that had cancer) was home alone. My sister Chelsey told me that Shyra called her frantically sobbing saying that she had just seen my dad in the kitchen with his head down crying. She was freaked out saying that something had to be wrong and she didn't know what the hell was going on. 

2 weeks later Shyra ended up in the hospital, the cancer had spread basically throughout her whole body. She was in the hospital for a few days, and I had just turned 11 so my mom didn't want me at the hospital so I really had no clue that she was even admitted, I was just at a friend's house for a couple of days which wasn't unusual for me. 

My brother Ronnie was at the hospital with my mom because he was 17. Ronnie told me that Shyra had a tube down her throat, but she could still use her phone to type out what she wanted to say, she was awake, but weak. She pointed to the corner of the room and was trying to communicate so he gave her the phone. She typed out to him that Heaven and God were real, and that my dad was in the room along with my dad's dad, who passed away in like 2001. He asked her what they wanted and she pointed to herself. She passed away within the next 24 hours on September, 20, 2009 at the age of 19. 

I know you can say that Shyra was probably delusional or whatever because she was about to die, but get this. 

While all of that was going on in the hospital, Chelsey was still living in Washington and she got the earliest flight she could get back to Michigan. The night Shyra died was the night before Chelsey was leaving to come home. Chelsey was on the phone with my mom and Ronnie constantly so she was up super late and she had an early flight. She said she was just so exhausted from trying to make sure she knew everything that was going on with Shyra in the hospital, that she accidentally fell asleep for about an hour. 

She said that she had a dream that my dad and his cousin Jennifer (she was our second cousin and we didn't really know her, but she had died from a heroin overdose 2 months before my dad passed away) came to her in her dream saying that Shyra died and that she is with them now, and that she's okay. That dream woke Chelsey up because that last she knew Shyra was alive,  and it freaked her out. Just a few moments after she woke up my brother Ronnie called her saying Shyra just passed away and all Chelsey could say it that she already knew and told him about her dream.


EDIT: 

Someone posted links in the comments to confirm my dad and sister. 

I wanted to add this as well. On January, 10, 2010 that house caught fire. My mom went sledding with my little brother Dillon and my cousin Taylor. My sister and I were both sleeping in my mom's bed because we were all up very late the night before. We were dead asleep until my sister woke me up saying the house was on fire and that we needed to get out immediately. I was very confused and I couldn't see anything at all, not even the daylight through the window, but we ended up getting out because we knew the house so well that we didn't have to see to get out. She had 3rd degree burns on both of her hands from opening the door. We both went to the hospital for smoke inhalation and she got treated for the burns. 

We are both very heavy sleepers, we were awake until like 3 AM. People started stopping to help us when we got the front door open because smoke was pouring out of the house. We literally would have died otherwise, the doctors said we had about 30 seconds left before the smoke killed us. 

Chelsey told me that someone was saying ""Chels, wake up!"" until she got up and realized what was happening. Mind you nobody was there and I was still asleep. 

again if you don't believe me (which is super fucked up because why would i lie about any of this) just look up 8070 morrish road Swartz Creek house fire. The article wasn't fully correct because it said 3 people were there, but it was only me and my sister, we were so shook up that we didn't know if my mom, brother ect were there or not. My brother slept on the couch a lot of the time to be closer to my mom's bedroom so we thought they were still sleeping or possibly dead since we couldn't see anything at all until we noticed that my mom's truck was gone from the driveway. We broke the window to try to wake them up because the smoke that was pouring out of the door was too thick to even go near. The fire was also ruled electrical.


Edit 2:

For the people are wondering how I'm doing now, I'm doing fairly well. I have a son, he's 2 1/2 right now, I've been with his dad for 4 years. I'm okay emotionally other than wondering where I would be right now if my dad was still here, and where my older sister would be too. If she would ever find love and who she would choose to be with, if she was meant to have kids, ect. She would be 30 now. Shyra was the sibling that I was closet to, I would sleep in her bed with her every night because I was just so attached to her. She was 8 years older than me so she probably thought I was super annoying, but I wanted to be just like her. I copied her style and listened to the music she liked. We had a very special bond and it's truly a heartache knowing she isn't here anymore, and knowing she never got to experience life at all. I remember at my dad's funeral she sat next to me and we both were crying and she said ""It'll be okay, sister."" 
I'm only 22 and I feel like I haven't experienced a fraction of life yet, so knowing that she was gone before her 20th birthday is absolutely crushing. It's upsetting that my dad won't be able to walk me down the isle at my wedding someday. I think my dad took a bit of favoritism towards me because he would always tell me how special I was to him. He would do extra things for me and with me that he didn't do with my older siblings, like picking me up from my elementary school to go shopping, just him and I, or giving me little gifts to let me know he loved me. I feel like a piece of me was taken that year. It's something I will never fully recover from until we are hopefully reunited again. I don't think that I would have met the father of my child if things didn't pan out the way it did, so I think about everything leading up to having my son and put it in consideration that maybe everything happened for a reason, even if it was in a horrific way. I try to take good from the bad, I'm thankful to still have my mom and other siblings here to this day. Thank you to everyone for your condolences, if anyone has questions you can message me and i'll gladly speak to you."
t3_f716dx,all_ads,Random empty building my my work,Thetruthishere,"So I started working at where I work now about a year ago. On the way there on an exit ramp from the freeway there is a glass building, perfectly kept up in maintenance, but me nor anyone who has taken me to and from work has seen a single car there. At night the place is lit like there is someone in there, maybe the cleaning crew? But why are they cleaning or no one is ever there? Why is there to clean? I have passed the building at all times of day, and even at night. There is never a car there nor is there a sign to show what it is, it also looks like there is no public way to get to where this building is. It is very weird in my opinion and I am hoping you guys can help me out here."
t3_f70ewx,all_ads,Sudden rush of extreme fear,Thetruthishere,"I have no idea if this is the place to post it, but here goes nothing.

This just happened. I went to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and I heard a loud gasp right next to me. I was pretty unsettled by this, but eventually went about my day and forgot about it.

I just took a shower. I always sing really loudly, and today was no different. But in the middle of the shower I froze. I was just terrified for no discernible reason. After I looked at the tiny window next to me, fight or flight kicked in and I instantly ducked.

I turned off the shower and made no noise. I had no idea why, but I was certain something terrible was going to happen as soon as I made noise or looked back at that window.

I feel like I heard noises too, but I can't remember or describe any of them, so maybe it was just the paranoia or fear speaking

I stayed like that for a while, until I felt safe. After some time I felt like I was finally alone again, and that's when I got out of the shower.

I am honestly hoping for a sane explanation here, maybe something is wrong with my head, I don't know

Have any of you ever experienced something similar? Just extreme panic out of nowhere?"
t3_f6x6jy,all_ads,"""The time I was visited by a spirit when I was younger""",Thetruthishere,"I remember one experience that to be honest, I still think about from time to time. It happened in my old home, where I use to live. That area was known for some strange things, but that is another story. Anyway, I was probably about, between 11 and 14, I think... What happened was, I was on my bed. For a idea it was a small room on the second floor of the house I was in. And there was the bathroom, the main room that later, I slept in, but had to move due to a family member, my grandma needing the space. What happened in my room, which was compacted tightly to a point of only one person fitting through is that, I was like I said on the bed listening to music. And then suddenly I feel a pressence of a spirit. It was probably my guess a young spirit. So I asked it, ""do you need help?"" To which it responded by running across the room to the pull couch. You can hear paper flying or see paper going up in the air. I still wonder what that was...,."
t3_f72a8e,all_ads,My mom has witnessed some paranormal things at one of her friend's house,Thetruthishere,My mom when she was a teen I think went to sleepover at a friends house which was reportedly haunted when they were pulling in she and her friend saw two glowing red eyes staring down at them and my mom always had an all around bad feeling about the place and they found a noose hung up in a shed and they took it down but when they came back the noose was back up. Now the house was torn down and a new house was built on the same spot as the old one. (btw this is my first time posting so sorry if I made you cringe.)
t3_f6uy9t,all_ads,My grandfather saw two black figures a night before he died..,Thetruthishere,"He was very ill and could not even speak properly. He told my brother to ask the two burkha clad women in front of him to sit down. Many visited him as his health was declining, as he was a respected figure in my town. But there was no one then. He kept on telling my brother to ask them, to which he repeatedly told no one's here. He had slept one last time that day.

NOTE: My dad's aunt used to say yama-kinkaras(servants of lord yama, the hindu god of death) would come to assist you in your souls journey and only the dying ones can see them."
t3_f6thq6,all_ads,Green Bunny Rabbit,Thetruthishere,"          So this story starts out, and really ends, with me being a child growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now in my late 20’s I can see in retrospect I suffered from night terrors, as well as sleep paralysis until the age of 6/7.
           I would would fall asleep in my bunk bed, and open my eyes without being able to move my body on a nightly basis. It would feel as though I was screaming from the inside of my body. I would eventually break loose, and my parents would run into the room, me still screaming, having not realizing I’m audibly screaming now in reality.
            This is the part where it gets weird, and downright creepy... I would be screaming mainly due to a reoccurring dream I would have.... Every-night my Mom or Dad would put me to bed, I would be halfway between sleep and wake, and I would see Paper Sesame Street Characters at the edge of my bed. 
            They where little cut-outs being held up by popsicle sticks. I would see these little characters, and hear voices saying “Come play with us!”, and I knew they scared me every time. 
             However, every time I would just be so intrigued ,and try to grab one....When I did a hand would drag me underneath my bunk bed, and bring me into the “void”.
            Inside this “void” there was maybe some stars in the distance, but really nothing around. When I would look out, and I would see a humanoid glowing green bunny rabbit floating about 12 feet in front of me, with spinning spiral eyes, illuminating from the inside.
             He would communicate to me telepathically knowing my name, and things about my family. I would always be scared shitless, however he was always reassuring, and calm, which made me feel as though it was a benevolent force.
             The dreams where consistent of the Glowing Green Bunny rabbit taking me under, and talking to me telepathically for hours. 
             However, on one occasion he introduced to me his family. Saying, “See I have a family just like yours. I’m a dad just like you have a dad. And this is my kid, he’s almost your age”. 
              I remember being scared shitless seeing a family of glowing bunny rabbits with spiral swirly eyes staring at me, they were all different colors.
              After around the age of 7 the night terrors stopped , and my glowing friend stopped visiting me in my dreams. I drew a lot as a kid, and my mom swears she has a picture I drew that resembles a “Grey” alien.      However, to this day I vividly remember drawing a rabbit with green fur and swirly eyes in crayon. 
             It’s an ongoing joke in my family, saying things like Area 51 since we are in Vegas, and they bring it up every once in awhile.
             The creepy thing is — get this. My cousin was talking about his night terrors one time to me and my family. There really wasn’t anything that lined up with my dreams, however he mentioned these “Paper Sesame Street characters on Popsicle sticks” that used to lure him into his basement during his “scary night terror dreams”. That coincidence freaked me out more-so than anything.

t3_f6v4pi,all_ads,First of several stories: Abduction dream followed by catching a govt surveillance,Thetruthishere,"So this is the first of several stories I feel that I need to post on this sub.  Some will be my own, some will be my mom's, but this one in particular happened to both of us.  Regarding the title: I had the dream and my mom caught the surveillance guy.

I've always had dreams about aliens.  Aliens chasing me through the house, alien invasions, all out war between us and them.  They stopped roughly in my early twenties and I haven't been plagued since.  I still have thoughts, fears, and recollections from time to time though, especially after reading a Reddit post or finding a new (to me) subreddit like this one.  

This one particular dream is the one dream that stands out to me the most.  It happened when I was in high school, about 15 or so, roughly 16 years ago.  For context (and this is important) I don't have a relationship with my biological father.  My parents divorced when I was 5 and between then and the summer I turned 15 it was rocky.  A couple weeks after I turned 15 I had the realization about all the ways he wronged me and decided to call him out on it in hopes that he'd admit his mistakes so we could move on.  He didn't do I cut ties with him.

This is where the dream occurs.  A month or so after that, I have the dream.  In this dream I'm woken up by a bright, but dull, purplish-pinkish light.  Now, my bedroom window was a big window with a curved window just above it.  We put blinds over the big rectangular part but left the curved portion clear.  I could see the sky from this portion and that's where the light was coming from.  I could tell the sky was cloudy like a thunderstorm was occuring but there was no rain, thunder, or lightning.  The whole sky was the purplish-pinkish color.

  In the sky, half made out of clouds, half not, was a face.  If you've ever googled what the classic grey looks like and you stumble across pictures of other races, this face was that of a brown.  I've read that they're usually the leaders/captains of the crew.

Wanting a better view I peek through the blinds onto the street and see a car parked in front of my bedroom, right by our mailbox.  It was an old 70s, Cadillac style car with a man standing outside it.  I got the impression and feeling that whoever was doing all this wanted me to think it was my biological father and that I had to go with him.  But it wasn't my biological father, that I knew.  And even if it was I didn't want to go with him because of what had happened earlier that month/month prior.  So (still in the dream) I raced to my mom's bedroom, woke her up, told her what I saw and what was going on, she got out of bed as fast as she could, didn't even put on pants, we got in her car and drove away, the sky still lit up by that purplish pinkish light.

If that were the end of it Id say it was a stress dream caused by the emotional trauma I went through.  But it wasn't.  The next morning I told my mom about the dream and she told me her experience.  That night, around 2-3 am, she was woken up by a beeping under her bed, followed by a light, like a cars headlight, shining into her bedroom.  For more context, our house was on a corner with my mom's bedroom right next to the garage and her bedroom window looking out onto the main street going though the neighborhood.  The street our house was on, the street my bedroom faced with our mailbox on it ended in two cul-de-sacs on either end with the main thoroughfare street cutting it in half. 
My mom peeked through the blinds and saw an unmarked car of roughly the same make, model, and color of the car in my dream sitting at the stop sign across the main street from our house shining a light into her bedroom.  The driver must've saw her and gotten spooked because they then started driving real slow up and down our street several times, looking like they were patrolling.  

Our subdivision was relatively new and in a developing part of my small city.  Around us was all farmland.  In fact when we first moved in some 4 years prior the edge of our backyard was lined with barbed wire pasture fence and we had cows come up to us.  By the time I had the dream the subdivision grew behind us and there were more streets and houses, but the surrounding area was still farmland.  Not exactly a hive of criminal activity.  

We called the city police non emergency number to complain about being woken up by one of their patrols and they said 1.) We didn't have any patrols in the neighborhood at that time, 2.) Their patrol cars aren't unmarked, nor are they 70s Cadillac style.

This is just one of several personal stories I have rolling around in my brain.  Let me know if you'd like to hear more."

Ultimately, I'm the one that navigates where my mind goes, but I appreciate the seemingly endless array of rabbit holes certain platforms like this one like to take me down because, inevitably, in relation to my perceived interests (clicks), that's the conscious path ""they've"" been programmed to take. In the end, I find comfort in knowing that nature as creation, and my soul as a likeness to the creator, will exist infinitely beyond the A.I. and it's information-aged creator that I've been forced to experience a relationship with."
t3_f677nz,all_ads,More than a coincidence?,Thetruthishere,"    - [ ] I was kept away from my father pretty much my entire childhood, starting from the moment I was born. He and my mother split while she was still pregnant with me and for whatever reason she did everything in her power to make sure to keep him away from me. We even moved to another state and she always told me stories that lead me to believe it were probably better that way. Even tho my stepdad wound up being nothing but a piece of shit who liked touching little girls but anyway, he isn’t even worth me wasting one more second of my story on him, so I’ll just leave it at that. Anyways, years later I eventually moved back to my home state to live with my grandparents in the 6th grade but the wedge my mom had placed between me and my dad was already there, and since he was pretty much a complete stranger to me, our relationship continued on as an estranged one,  for many more years. Eventually, when I was 21, I decided to get over the awkwardness and my dad and I finally formed an actual father/daughter type relationship. To this day I try not to hold any resentment against my mom for keeping us away from each other but it’s hard sometimes, bc honestly he really wasn’t a bad person, and definitely not compared to the garbage that was my stepdad. I mean who doesn’t make mistakes from time to time rite? Lord knows I do.. and your a liar, any of you, that won’t agree that you sometimes do as well lol, so I was 21 the first time I called him Dad instead of calling him by name and 21 before I ever told him I loved him.. I don’t know if she honestly believed it was what was best, or if she just did it with the sole purpose of hurting him.  Anyway a year or 2 after getting close to my dad, he and I had a slight falling out that was actually over a disagreement between him and my fiancé who was a little controlling to say the least, so there were a couple of years where we really didn’t talk. A couple of years go by and I was pregnant with my 2nd child, a little girl, actually the first girl to be born in my family since me, 24 years before. People in town would often stop and tell me how excited my dad was that I was going to be giving him his first granddaughter so I decided it was time to put the bullshit behind us, I figured there had been enough lost years already so I tell my fiancé that I was going to take my son up to my dads and go surprise him for Christmas. He was totally against it but I didn’t care I’d been kept away from my dad my whole life he wasn’t gonna keep me away longer than he already had! It seemed I was finally starting to grow a backbone lol.. this was sometime around the first part of December that I made these plans. Then one night I have this dream, my dad comes to me and we sorta chit chat a bit, then we each apologized to the other and hugged that’s all I really remember. I didn’t really give it much thought, just chocked it up as one of those weird pregnancy dreams. The following day I get up and take my son to daycare, then head to work. After work I pick up my son and go to my sister in laws house and while we were sitting there talking, my cell phone rings so I pull it out of my back pocket to see it’s my mom calling. Which is weird already as she never calls me, so I answer and this is how the conversation goes.. 
- [ ] 
Mom: “Sweetie did you already hear about your dad?”
Me: “umm no what the hell are you talking about what happened, is he ok?” 
Mom: “oh honey no I’m so sorry but your dad passed away last night, he had a heart attack.” 
 
This phone call was on December 15th, he died the night of the 14th, I never got to surprise him for Christmas, that’s just my typical shit luck honestly, but I like to think that he at least came to me in my dreams to let me know that he loved me and to say goodbye.. I mean, what are the odds of me having that dream, at rite around the same time he passed. The shit still kills me, 9 years later, the guilt of not making things rite with him sooner is something I’m sure I’ll always regret but it would be much worse if I hadn’t had that dream, even if that’s all it were was just a dream at least it gave me a little peace of mind.."
t3_f6dev4,all_ads,My Crazy UFO Experience 2009,Thetruthishere,"I've told this story a couple of times and just want to keep getting it out there as it needs to be read/listened too. 

Bicester, UK 

I had a strange experience 11 years ago where I had this fascination out of the blue of ufos and feeling the need of sitting out and looking for them? I was 14 at the time and UFOs or aliens I had never thought about before. Couldn't have cared less at that age either.

The next day forced some of my family to sit in the garden with me under the stars on an amazing clear evening and we were sat talking for about 10 minutes then I noticed a strange white light just like a spotlight that you would get in your kitchen not bright but dull in colour. As if it was attached to something? Like oval in shape this is how I knew it was attached. 

This light slowly moved over the houses to the left of us no noise and stopped right in front of us probably 100ft in the air and probably 200ft away. 

Now this is where it gets weird. 

I feel this strange feeling erupt in my chest like an adrenaline rush. But wasn’t. I felt like I had lost a sense of time and where I was almost as if I was unconscious. But at the same time fixated on this light but not actually there with my body... it’s hard to explain. 

All of a sudden the light brightens and as best as I can describe pings at a speed and acceleration I have never seen in my life. 0-20000 mph maybe... seriously fast still no noise...

I lost track of it for a second then something made me look up into the sky above and I noticed the white light miles and miles up. As small as a star and then zip into space leaving a small trail of light behind it like a comet. 

My family had said nothing the whole time. We all looked at each other after and no one could say anything. I think everyone was beyond frightened that an object like that exists. 

Anyone else seen something similar?"
t3_f6obsr,all_ads,ufo/alien encounter 09/28/2019,Thetruthishere,"on september 27 my friend and i went out around 4:30am on the 28th to a church parking lot to smoke. we were smoking on the hood of my car and saw a ufo that was three lights in a line then it shifted and became a triangle then disappeared. it was flying super low and super slow and made no sound it was silent until after it left then normal nature sounds came back. a wave of anxiety and almost terror came over us as it passed over us. 

we were scared and went home and i went to the backyard to finish smoking and he went inside to try to sleep and i saw an alien in my backyard. it was a figure in a normally pitch black area between some trees, moving:bouncing slightly with a blue glow outlining it. i talked to my coworker who’s like familiar w aliens about it and she said from my description it sounded like a blue avian but anyway i stared for a few minutes then got scared and ran tf inside. then my friend and i tried to sleep but we couldn’t we took SO much melatonin but nothing happened so we started talking then at one point we stopped talking and started just talking through our minds and neither of us realized we had actually stopped speaking out loud till i was like uhhh did u hear me?? and then we started talking out loud abt how we both heard each other in our heads, it was weird. 

then i eventually fell asleep and he got stuck in a time loop where it was 6:25 and the time wouldn’t change and he tried using the stopwatch on his phone but it just stayed at 00;00 when he pressed start.  he would repeat his actions over and over again and he realized i wasn’t breathing. every time the loop happened he heard a pop in his brain and footsteps coming up the stairs getting closer every time. he would check if i was breathing and if i had a pulse which i didn’t and he’d try to shake me awake and i never responded. throughout the whole thing a voice in his head was telling him there’s conditions like we either had to join together physically into one person or we both die. 
so finally at the end the footsteps were right outside my door and he was like no no no she needs to live this isn’t happening and he traveled back in time for what felt like 7 years like he was moving and thinking all in reverse then at the end he looked and i was breathing again. he also called two of our friends while i was “dead” and told them that i was dead and they both said something along the lines of “she’ll be fine. i know you can do it” but neither of them remember answering or saying anything. they both have the call log though. 

the next morning i had an alarm set for 8 and my friend said i woke up with no emotions on my face, looked him in the eyes and my eyes looked like they had no life in them, then turned off my alarm and went back to sleep. i do not do that like i wake up to my alarm and i get up or i at least remember if i turn it off but i don’t remember anything. i finally actually woke up at 11 to my little brother banging on my door and crying bc my mom thought i was dead and like a mother knows when her child dies or whatever they feel it so don’t friend said that was weird. but anyway i didn’t know that i had died at that point i went my entire day not knowing but wondering why i felt dead i literally felt like i had woken up from the dead and i did not know why until he told me the next day what happened after i slept

i’m sorry this is really messy i copied it from my notes and did quick editing bc i’ve told the story so many times. if anyone wants more details let me know and i’ll give them. this is all a 100% true personal experience with my best friend"
t3_f6nx6y,all_ads,Attic door/ladder opened on its own,Thetruthishere,"Alright so I really don't know if this is the /best/ place to post this, but I felt like posting it just to see what other people think. 

Just some quick history: I recently moved into a new house that I'm renting with two other roommates, and we've been here since the very last week of January. Since the move in we've noticed just how much work done on the house appears to have been done by the owner, or professionals who were barely professionals. This isn't to say it's a bad house, we love it, but there's things here and there that if you pay enough attention will stick out. One of which is the fact that there are two attic doors in the garage. They're right next to each other, and one was clearly the original while the other looks new, yet doesn't have finishing touches on it, even though it does seal properly when shut (so no complaints). I decided to open the newer one and climb up a bit just to take a peak around because I'm young and haven't had much of a reason in life to ever go into an attic, so I took this as an opportunity. It was clear when I got up there that the original door was no longer a door, and had stuff like extra wood tiles ontop of it. I climbed down, and shut the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

About two hours later one of my roommates comes knocking at my door saying that when she went to take something to the recycling bin, it was still open. I got up, checked it out, and yep! It was hanging open. The ladder wasn't completely unfurled, but the door was all the way down. The reason I make this post is because after closing it again and tugging on the string that pulls it down, I noted just how much force was required to bring it down. There's actually a certain stage you have you pull past for it to /really/ open up, and if you don't go past this threshold the door snaps shut again. So I've been wondering all night... how on earth did it open itself up? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the obvious answer: the roommate did it. However I have a lot of doubt that they did this because their reaction seemed pretty genuine, and I've known them almost my entire life. So we've both been checking on it periodically, and it has yet to open again. If you ask me if I believe in the paranormal btw, I say that I believe we don't fully understand our universe yet and that I'm open to things. But I don't lean hard into ghosts or demons, even if I do have fun around other people who are superstitious and invite them in every so often. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question, has anyone else ever had this happen? Is this possible? Should I upload a video showing how hard it is to open it in the first place to lend credence to my post? Idk, I just wanted to post this somewhere and see what people thought."
t3_f6hmsx,all_ads,Some kind of spiritual connection touched several members of my family on the night of my grandpa's death.,Thetruthishere,"My grandpa (my dad's father) died last year and on the day before/night of his death several members of my family, including my wife and my mom's side of the family, had experiences relating to his death. My grandpa served in the Air Force. He was in his late 80s when he died, his health had taken a turn for the worse in the last few years and he was pretty much confined to a wheelchair.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first incident, on the night of his death my dad, his 2 siblings and my grandma all couldn't sleep. Even though he had his health problems nobody was expecting him to die so soon, so there is no reason that they were up all night. 

The second incident involved my mom's parents on the day before my grandpa died. Both of them went on vacation and stopped at some kind of airplane or Air Force museum. Throughout the day my mom's dad kept making comments about how they should buy things from the gift store like model planes or American Flags and statues of the Bald Eagle  for my grandpa. It got so frequent and random that my mom's mother asked what was wrong with him and he said, ""I don't know, I just can't get him off my mind.""

The final incident occurred with my wife. On the night of my grandpa's death she had a dream that my entire family was having a get-together on the back patio at our house. She said that she remembers my grandpa wasn't in his wheelchair anymore but he was sitting at the table with everyone and acting more like he was before he got sick."
t3_f6kang,all_ads,Almost 18,Thetruthishere,"So tomorrow I turn 18, and for the past month or so I've been getting insanely vivid dreams. 

Usually, when I sleep I either get sleep paralysis, have dreams and forget them, or have lucid dreams. In these recent vivid dreams, questions I've been thinking about have been answered, from what college is best for me to why did so and so actually break up. 

Then, today I was in a crowded space and I suddenly felt heavy, like there was some bad vibes or something. With all of this stuff going on I'm thinking I'm reaching some kind of spiritual awakening, but not sure."
t3_f6f79d,all_ads,Shadow Person or Child,Thetruthishere,"I have owned my octagon house (built in 1855 and has 8 equal sides) for about 18 years. Just recently have experienced some things I can't explain. This story is 100% true and I'm not a person who necessarily believes in ghosts, spirits etc...so I'm not jumping to any conclusions or ready to sell the house just yet.

About 6 months ago, my wife and I were having issues with my 10 year old daughter sleeping in her bed. She would run into our bed every night. Not unusual as I'm sure anyone with children can attest. One night, my daughter ran into our room and jumped into bed taking up all the room and blankets. I decided to get up and sleep in her bed for the night.

At about 3:00 am, I was sleeping on my side facing my daughter’s bedroom door. I opened my eyes without moving at all and right in front of me was a dark shadow of a short person or child looking at me. No features at all, just like a black cloudy/smoky form that had a volume to it (not 2 dimensional). I didn't move or blink for about 15 or 20 seconds and it just blew away to my right... Surprisingly enough, I didn't jump out of my bed and run or anything like that. I just rolled over on my back and started to ask myself if I had really seen what I thought I did. I then looked at my phone on the floor and it was about 3:15 am. After laying there for a couple minutes, I started to get scared about what I saw and returned to my bedroom where my wife and daughter was sleeping. I climbed into bed with them and eventually went back to sleep. In the morning I told my wife but not my daughter (and never would since I don't want to scare her). I had since tried to write this off as sleep paralysis or something like that but deep down inside I was sure I was awake.

It gets crazier... just last week, my family and I were out to dinner and the subject of ghosts came up. I asked my daughter if she had ever experienced anything she couldn't explain (remember, I never told her about my experience). She then said one night in her bed she woke up and saw the shadow of a girl floating near her door! I of course didn't tell her I did as well but my wife and I locked eyes and she said we were both crazy.

There have also recently been some other things happening with electronics acting up (phones coming on in the middle of the night playing videos and the TV changing channels) but thank God no shadow people. My dog has also been seen barking and growling at things in adjacent rooms at times when nobody is there."
t3_f6hiwe,all_ads,Trying to make sense of winter encounter with light,Thetruthishere,"     I have always believed in other “beings”. I like to think of them as spirits stuck between worlds, although I of course don’t have the answers nor do I care to as to what they really are. Anyways, on to the story. 
     Last Winter, my boyfriend and I were packing up to head to Lake Tahoe for an overnight for my birthday. I was very excited, had stayed the night at his the night before we left, and was all packed.
      Now, I am a very organized person. I misplace things often but do it with intention and often know where to find them when I do. However, the morning we were to leave, it seemed I had misplaced my wallet. I remember thinking weird, it was just in my purse. My boyfriend and I set out to search anyways.        He went to search the car and I went to search his room. I was throwing his comforter on the ground when all of the sudden, my attention shifted to his light. I sat on the bed and just stared at it for a moment. It was a tall standing lamp with two lights attached to it. I looked over in the other direction, and when I looked back, it was falling straight in front of me. 
      Time slowed down and as it passed me, I felt a warm sensation explode throughout my chest. It crashed to the ground and one of the two lights shattered. I ran out of the house screaming and crying, knowing my boyfriend had mentioned having a being in the house before. His parents, him, and his little sister had experienced it before, but it was my first experience with something like this. Soon after, we found my wallet sitting on the dresser, without any explanation as to how or when it got there. 
      I think about this often and without explanation, but I’ve never felt that warm sensation again, nor do I think I will. I’ve never been sensitive to light, but since then have become extremely sensitive to it.(I apologize for the font, I’m a frequent lurker but rare poster)."
t3_f6k82a,all_ads,A less crazy UFO encounter. Malta 2011,Thetruthishere,"Spent a holiday on the island of Malta staying right in the middle of the town centre. I was out in the evening having a drink on the room balcony when I noticed three red lights travelling in a triangle formation.

These lights must have been 20,000ft travelling very quickly over and away from me and at this point I thought must have been some kind of aircraft but my thoughts very quickly changed. 

Probably five or so seconds after noticing the object the lights begin to move. The light at the top of the triangle moved in between the two bottom lights and created another triangle once that triangle was created a different light would then between the two points and create another triangle and this continued as a flowing motion and timing like a 1,2 beat. 

Now either these lights were connected to something as they were still travelling at the same rate before they began interchanging or they were controlled individually as part of a group very intelligently controlled to keep the same pace through the sky constant. 

They slowly moved away from me through the sky and into the distance."
t3_f6ge0v,all_ads,Strange feelings,Thetruthishere,"Not really posting or opening about these particular stories but i got a strange feeling i have to spill this out. 

Not really long stories but after reading a bunch of posts in this sub, a lot of people were kinda describing the same thing or experiencing at least something simmilar to my experience.

This all started last summer when i got my first job in a hotel/bar very far away from my city and since then they never stopped. 
To keep it short let me get straight in. I was working on a very very long shift (from 7am in the morning till 10-11 before midnight) and i started to get like these very uneasy feelings like someone is watching me even when i was all alone cleaning up the hall. Since i always was very tired from the work i just never really worried about it and blamed it on that, till one day i was in the reception sector looking for some paperwork i felt a double tap on my sholder like someone trying to get my attention. I immeditately turn back and no one was there. I felt really weird but as usual i thought i was just flippin out. Hours later i was rushing to the bathroom and unfortunately it was occupied and i had to wait for a bit. As i was waiting i got that same touch but now it was more powerful and it had more volume, like someone hit me with their shoulder. It hit me outta nowhere and i thought one of my coworkers was playing with me and i got so mad and sprinted the way to the bar were the bartenders were working. I asked each and everyone of them including strangers and they all sweared they did not get near me at that time. I was confused and weirded out at the same time it literally made me quit the job. 

Since that day, i hear very distorted voices and most of the time i can’t make a single word out of what i hear, i get these type of touches almost everyday it doesn’t freak me out that much anymore. It is really obstructive someties cuz i’ll be in school around people when this happnes and i act very strange, same in home, when i go out, literally everywhere. I even got my parents convinced i have some brain issues and i had to get checked for that.Some of the words i could formulate from these voices are: don’t, listen, and some weird laughs( wich are mostly rare).

It was mostly these till 3 weeks ago when i saw a dream where i was in a black room with only one window whith a slight form of light wich made it visible for me to see around. I couldnt move and i was sorrounded by some shadow moving “energy” that would take any shape or form of people i knew but with a weird shaped face. They turned to my dad, mom, sister and bunch of people i know and the only thing i could here was listen. I didnt had this kind of dream anymore for now but the voices and the touches are still there.
If anyone know anything or has experienced anything like this please reply...!"
t3_f5udui,all_ads,"Had a conversation with a being, don’t know what to make of it.",Thetruthishere,"
There’s this thing I do sometimes before I fall asleep and it lets me see some pretty interesting things.  So I wait until I’m on that verge of sleeping, the point where your eyes get heavy and you start dozing off.  When I’m at that point, I focus on not thinking of anything and taking mental notes of what I see. Sometimes I see locations like a skyline or mountains, trees, plains.   It’s usually scenery and it’s not like a clear picture it’s hazy, almost like looking out of a lightly fogged window where you can see things buts it’s a little out of focus. So an example of the mental notes I take would be; trees, mountains, orange sunset, light clouds.  I do these mental notes so I can remember what I’m seeing when I wake up.  I keep myself from thinking of anything else so as to make sure I’m not imagining things/ projecting images of my own will.  I don’t know what exactly to call it but I know that if my mind isn’t clear I start seeing things that I know are coming from me.  

      An example of a time I let my imagination ruin it, was the time I saw a door at the end of a hallway.  It was like a door made of of steel or metal and it had a lot of designs carved on it.  I focused on getting closer to the door and then I saw like a faint red light emitting from it.  I was filled with a sense of fear/dread and then like a voice in my head said you shouldn’t be here.  My mind starting running and then what was just a door ended up turning into people in the hall way and cartoon characters and it got really ridiculous and I knew that the location(idk what else to call it)was ruined.

     I know this already seems long but I just want to make sure you guys have an idea of what I’m talking about.  That way if anyone else has experienced this or can help me figure this out it’s easier for you.  So this one particular night I’m doing the same thing, waiting until I have that heavy sleepy feeling etc.  Right off the beginning something is strange. Everything is dark.  I almost questioned if there was just a power outage and I was just looking at my dark room, until I see this being.  The best way to describe it is if you google human wire sculpture but it had longer arms and no feet.  It looked like that but made out of energy?  It’s hard to explain it was like looking at a blue/whiteish being made of lightning bolts or something. It wasnt emitting light or anything but that’s the best way I can describe it.  We weren’t in any particular place. It seemed dark but it was more of a nothingness.  Again it’s hard to describe because the area we were in wasn’t any particular location, it was more of a feeling.  Have you ever been in a black out and the lights first go out, you stretch your arms out to feel for anything?  It’s almost like you’re blind and then you bump into something and you’re like “ok good I know exactly where in the house I am.”   The place we were in felt like that initial moment of a black out.

We proceed to have a conversation.  It wasn’t like talking to someone. It was me thinking a question and then it being answered via another voice in my head.  I asked what it was and it said “we are both the same species”.  I said I didn’t understand what it meant and it replied “we are beings experiencing a physical life”. (I’m going to type the rest as the conversation we had)
- so what makes us so different
- “Emotions”
- What about emotions makes us special
- “Emotions were engineered into our physical forms, its what keeps us tethered to our physical forms”
- So why can’t we leave our physical forms
- “Emotions were put there to give you a realistic physical experience.  We have gotten lost in our physical forms and confused them to be our true forms.”
- So I look just like you
- “Yes”
I was then confused and felt this sense of sadness like being lost and longing for something distant that I didn’t understand. I began to fall into a deeper darkness and fell asleep.  When I woke up it felt like I had the strangest dream. I don’t know what to make of it.  Was it a dream? Was it a message?  Idk if this is even the right place to post this.  If not can someone please direct me to the right place.  Has any one had a similar experience?

TLDR:  I dreamt of a being made out of energy or something who told me that we are beings experiencing a physical world."
t3_f6gw9g,all_ads,Seashells moved into a circle,Thetruthishere,"I went to the beach last weekend with my bf and his friends. Right as were leaving the beach, my bf collected collected about 7 tiny seashells. They were all the same - smooth with a rounded top and flat bottom. He gave them to me and I put them in my pocket. When we got home, I took them out of my pocket and placed them in a pile on the the bed headboard. I left the room and joined everyone outside for a BBQ. I went back into the room a couple hours later to get something, and I noticed the shells that were in a pile were now forming a circle. I touched the shells and gathered them back into a pile. I thought my bf moved it to play a prank on me, or maybe my bf’s mom moved it for whatever reason. When I asked them they didn’t touch the shells. The friend who was staying with us never went into our room. I usually try to find a rational science explanation, but I really don’t know what happened here. And now I’m wondering if this is something paranormal, and what meaning it has."
t3_f66how,all_ads,Help.,Thetruthishere,"Hello. These past few months weird coincidences have been happening to me on a daily basis. A random image or event pops in my head for no apparent reason at all at the most random times of the day then a few hours or days later it comes true. This happens to me Almost every week. Once or twice a week to be exact. Now please keep in mind I don’t think I have some kind of “magical powers” or can see into the future. But I just think it’s all coincidence but very very odd. So this is an example of what I’m “experiencing”. Yesterday I was driving to work. Listening to music. Paying attention to work. Then a “random” imagine pops in my head for a split second then goes away. This image was a image of a Gatorade in a can. Weird right? That same day after work I decided to pump gas. Felt thirsty so I walked in to my buy myself a water. When I walked up to the cashier to pay what do I see? Gatorade in a can. Odd. A more disturbing situations that happened to me was a few weeks ago. I was with my girlfriend. We were eating dinner at some sushi spot. As the waiter come up to me and ask for my order I zoned out for a split second and got a image of a white owl staring at me dead in the eyes. Then I zoned backed and continued to order. Three days later I’m driving home on a Friday night. There was construction the usual route i take home going to my friends house so I had to take a different route. It was around 1 am on a Friday night and I was the only car in that road. Then suddenly I something small in the middle of the road from a distance. Almost resembling a small child. It creeped me out for a bit so I tuned in my high beams as I got closer. Then soon came to realize its a owl. Chilling dead center of my lane. I told myself “no fucken way dude” so I drove closer to the owl. I was maybe 20 ft away from the owl and it wouldn’t move an inch. It just kept staring it me. I stared at it for a few seconds. So I went around it. Driving away looking at my rearview mirror I realize the owl was still staring. So I just went about my night. Another disturbing image that I got happened recently. On Friday. I was out grocery shopping. Looking for some meet for a BBQ and I had a mental thought of some lady dressed in blue jeans and a brown hoodie and she was in the floor. Her body laid motionless then suddenly began twitching at having a seizure. Then the image went away. This image was literally in my head for a split second. The next day me and my girlfriend decide to go to Disneyland since we are both annual pass holders. We were walking to a ride (haunted mansion) and come to find out it was close for renovation. As we found out it was closed we made a complete 180 turn and to go back the other direction we were coming from. At the corner of my eye I see someone just drop. My instinct told me to look at that direction. At first I thought some one had fallen or trip. But turns old it was just an elderly lady having a seizure.   

These kinds of things have been happening to my for months now. Every week now. I’ve been writing down everything that’s been happening on my notes. So far I have 35  “events” that’s popped in my head and came true.  I do believe it’s all coincidence. I can’t be the only one"
t3_f5yjbc,all_ads,Possibly being investigated/harassed after sending in a FOIA,Thetruthishere,"Hey all I'm a lurker that enjoys these encounters and stories and I've finally built up enough confidence to share some experiences I've been having since march. I know that many people here like anywhere else are often questioned about their mental health and I'd like to reassure everyone that I don't have any mental health issues and that I'm not paranoid. So let's begin.

So back in March or April of last year I wanted to investigate a topic that is common knowledge, but I believe doesn't have enough attention. Supposedly transformers films had the highest military involvement in any sci-fi movies. So eventually after spending countless hours trying to find any theories or articles that weren't a copy and paste or just regurgitating other articles/theories I decided to give a FOIA request a shot. So I sent a FOIA to SOCOM and the CIA with the main topic for information on funding/involvement in films or toy companies(out of a hunch). Then for the other two information topics I said, eh whatever and for the second topic I requested info regarding aliens, military encounters with aliens, etc.(out of a hunch) Then the third was just a lob because I couldn't think of anything and asked for info regarding any joint military-alien alliances.(a tiny hunch) Obviously I decided to keep the last two topics in theme with the movie research. I believe it was within ten-twenty minutes that I got a message basically saying fuck off from SOCOM. So then it just became a wait for a response from the CIA. 

This is when things began to get interesting. So I started the next day as any other day, I woke up, got ready for the day, said goodbye to my GF and went to the gym. After completing my workout, I began walking home in the direction of the Dunkin donuts. I got up to the sidewalk in between the main road and the Dunkin parking lot and suddenly a guy with a camera walks up to me and asks if I'd like to answer some questions for his college project. I became kind of suspicious due to the fact that there were about five other people he could've asked in the parking lot and he looked pretty old to be in college. So just out of curiosity I decided to take part in it. So he asked me two questions which I can't remember, but my reply to one of them was ""amazing"". Then he told me to write my answer in a crayola sketch book which weirdly had ""God's plan"" written on every page except for one. Once I wrote it down, he had me go behind Dunkin to take a picture of me holding the sketch book. We did, I gave him my number and that was the end of it. 

Two weeks or so later I was walking through town with a friend, I was basically her babysitter and she was in the fire academy so we headed over to the police/fire department. Three of my other friends happened to be there for an issue with their vehicle. So we began talking and a sheriff pulls into the front parking lot of the police station. We were facing away from the sheriff's direction, he walked up on what used to be the stairs of the main entrance to the station and at this second I just so happened to turn my head to look behind us and caught the sheriff taking a picture of us with an iPhone. He then went back to his car and left and the rest of the day was normal.

About two months later with no contact whatsoever, the man who took my photo somehow tracked me down in the middle of town and gave me a copy of the photo. Which looks like a complete mugshot as he focused more on my face than the sketch pad. He then said ""some people said that you look like a survivor."" Then he left and disappeared, I've haven't seen him ever since.

Then shortly after my technology begins to act strange. My Xbox 360 which is basically a DVD player at this point begins turning on by itself regardless if it was unplugged or not. This happened for several months and eventually stopped, it happened again a few days ago. Twice. Then my phone signal began acting weird, the signal began going up and down frantically and has on occasion lost all service for a few seconds. It has been like this for the phone I'm using now and the one prior. Also just recently, my phone has started transmitting my location even though I always have location turned off, the little logo pops up in the info/notification bar. At my old apartment and now my new. This occasionally happens with my bluetooth stuff as well where their signals are terrible for a while.  Recently, I've done little tests and noticed that it goes back to normal for an hour in the morning and an hour around midnight. As if someone is tampering with it, stops and then resumes.

Now we get to the even weirder stuff that has happened within the last three to four months that has begun getting more and more constant. My GF and I have been going to the gym at around midnight for several months now and we're usually with a bunch of regulars. We go outside for a fifteen minute break we'll notice vehicles that slow down to the point it seems like a staredown. This also sometimes happens when we're working out as well. Usually these vehicles are the same from cars to SUV's and from trucks to mini-vans, then there's the occasional creepy utility van and I know law enforcement has some vans because I've been stopped by some in the past when they're hunting people. Mind you this is at around midnight, the streets are completely empty, all the businesses are closed, cleaning crews have already gone home. Some gym regulars have witnessed the strangeness as well. Then twice me and my gf have had someone film us from within the gym to the point we've gotten creeped out and left in the middle of the workout. 

Last night after a long day of experiencing many of the things above. I was in the bathroom going through constipation from taco bell, my gf heard beeping and then something tapped my window and it faded away. There's​ no trees by my windows and it happened twice, just minutes apart from each other. Also we're on the third level of the apartment building.

This is what I can remember so far over the past year and I'm not clear on why it's happening. Again, I don't have any mental issues and I'm never a paranoid person, I only get paranoid over bills or prepping for events that require me to dress up.

Sidenote: These experiences have also gotten me into researching aliens."
t3_f5tp9h,all_ads,Eventful Night,Thetruthishere,"Hi everyone and sorry for my deplorable English, I am from Baguetteland.
I will tell you what happened last night. 
For the context we are 19 years old, my friend's house is a bit old, many sad events have taken place in this one, both his parents have passed away, and he lives alone. So, I was with two friends in the house of one of the two friends in question, we were in the upstairs room, we were having fun watching weird shit on the internet as usual, it was approximately 3AM when suddenly I heard footsteps coming from the ground floor and almost inaudible murmurs and full of other very strange noises. My friends don't heard them and thought I was crazy, so I didn’t pay attention anymore. A few moments later I turned my head to the door that was closed and I saw under the door that the light of the stairwell was on (I had turned off all the lights while going up).Scared, I warned my friends, we armed ourself with knives and such valiant knights we decided to inspect all the house except that there was not the slightest soul. Was that a thief? A ghost? A problem with electricity? What do you think?"
t3_f5kagc,all_ads,Celebrity Ghost Stories,Thetruthishere,"Any of you ever watched it? If not, it’s a show where celebrities talk about their paranormal experiences. It’s 3 celebrities to an episode and each episode is like 30mins. It’s good!
If so, what’s your fav story or a story that really scared you?
I can’t remember which celebrity it was, but this man told a story about how every night for a while his gf would randomly chant in Latin and one time when he tried to record her she’d stop. The voice that she chanted in didn’t sound like her, she had no recollection of ever doing it and he eventually had to break up with her because of it. I thought that was soo scary. I would much rather see something than share a bed or room or home with someone that demonically chants every night

Edit: Celebrity Ghost Stories no longer comes on but if you would like to check it out, download the app tubi, it’s on Roku and tubi has the show for free. That’s how I watch it now"
t3_f5zixt,all_ads,Was my nightmare actually some sort of reality?,Thetruthishere,"I posted this previously on r/paranormal, but since I’ve discovered this sub I’ve decided maybe it belongs here, idk. 


Was my nightmare actually a reality??? HELP

Okay, so this is my first post on here, and I am also using my phone so I am sorry if something comes out wrong or whatever. I don’t even know where to start, but bare with me, this will probably be long. 

*Note that I have always been into the paranormal and had been using ouija boards for a very long time, even around this time and continued afterward*

Back to the point. In October 2018, I had a very ‘real’ feeling nightmare and I’ve always remembered it and have been very confused and left with no explanation. 
I was somewhere in the middle of the open, and I was alone. I remember that there was a large pool and there were these men in long black cloaks with white paint on their faces, every one the same, and black paint on their eyes and cheeks. Wherever I was, I had noticed there were a couple, normal people, not in cloaks, no face paint. Except they were being drowned in the large pool by these cloaked men, as if they were being punished? They would die, and then come back to life the relive the drowning. Over and over. 
After this my dream shifted to me being in some sort of library, and I see the same couple messing with a few books. I knew they shouldn’t have been doing it, it felt very wrong. I think maybe they were in trouble for that?? Idk. But the same men had came to get them ( I think my dream had played out backwards). 
And then it shifted again. This time, I was back outside but someone that I didn’t know and couldn’t see their face (not a cloaked person) was leading me down a cement stairwell going underground. (To describe it, i was going down and it was dark and at the end of the steps is a well and to your right is an opening to a large, very VERY dark room that was also cement) the man I was with told me to turn the light on (on the inside of said room) and I was scared shitless and told him I couldn’t. I don’t know why but I was absolutely terrified of sticking my arm in that room. So this man turns the light on, and all of the sudden what seemed like 100s of the cloaked men where there, all looking the same, staring at me as if they know I wasn’t supposed to be there.  They looked like they literally kept multiplying. They looked at me like they wanted to kill me and then I woke up. 

So the reason why I question if this was some sort of reality and I “went” somewhere in my dream, was because for about a week afterwards, I kept seeing online the lead singer from a metal band “GHOST” I believe is the band name, he looked EXACTLY like these men with his face paint etc. I looked further into it and it turns out he worships satan. I have never seen pictures of this man, never even heard of the band. This happened the next day when I discovered it and he kept popping up for a while. Idk. Could be a coincidence but I guess I just wanted to know what other people think... do you think i could’ve went somewhere potentially dangerous? Maybe I astral projected or something? Idk. Also I am sorry if anything came off sounding bad in this post I just generally have no idea of what happened, it just felt so real. Any advice would be nice. It hasn’t happened since.

Edit: the man that accompanied me down the stairway was a nice man and was trying to help me somehow. No idea who he was though."
t3_f5sonm,all_ads,Hearing strange sounds while making homework,Thetruthishere,"TLDR: I felt really uneasy while making my homework alone, and then strange sounds started appearing 

I'm on mobile, so I am sorry for the format.

Rural Area in the PHILIPPINES - 9:30PM, tonight 

I was alone in our family room, making my homework. While writing, I suddenly felt uneasy and paranoid. It felt like someone or something was watching me. I was going to stop making my homework but I really wasn't in the mood for cramming.

I continued writing and thinking about my surroundings. Why do I feel so uneasy? Could someone or something be watching me? If so, who or what? Where? Why? I kept questioning myself because I was scared for no apparent reason. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, I hear a sound downstairs. It sounded like a spoon banging on a glass. It started slow and soft, but the more I listened, the faster and harder it got. I thought I went crazy due to the paranoia. What caused me to believe this sound was real? Simple, it was my dog.

My dog, which was sleeping beforehand, woke up when the sound appeared. The dog looked confused, as if it was asking ""What the heck is that sound?"" The weird part was when my dog went near the stairs and just started staring at a specific section in the living room downstairs. 

I started to jot down anything I could find for my homework. I knew that I had to finish this quickly because I was getting frightened by this lingering sound. When I did finish, I ran to my sister's room and returned the school supplies that I borrowed. I was hesitant to go back but I had to because my phone and other things were there.

I walked back to the area and surprisingly, the sound was gone and my dog was playing with it's toy. However, the feeling of paranoia was still there. As I hurriedly grabbed my headphones, I swear I heard a man's voice.  It sounded like he was saying ""hehe"" but in a distorted way. I was petrified by this and basically scrammed out of there."
t3_f5lvlx,all_ads,Wendigo Ft. Drum NY (Antwerp vicinity),Thetruthishere,"I was out running a tank trail alone around 1900(7pm) I had my head phones in and was just cruising to some techno. No more than 50 meters in front of me a grey/white humanoid figure runs from the tree line on the left side of the road to the tree line on the right.. faster than I’ve ever seen a human move..I stoped and yelled out NO FUCKING BUENO and proceeded to quick pace backpedal while scanning to my 2 o clock. I got about 500 meters from sighting and called one of my guys. He come hauling down the road and links up with me. Ironically he tells me that during the land navigation portion of Best warrior comp, him and another NCO where literally chased through the woods by what they called a wendigo. Mind you these dudes are fucking pipehitters, 2-3 SF combat deployment type. Not the kind of cats that are scared of some wild Native American folklore. I know what I saw and it blew my fucking mind.

t3_f5l9gb,all_ads,"Drones/UFOs in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming.",Thetruthishere,"Since a bit after Christmas of last year, there had been many sightings every night from 6 pm to 11 pm of unidentified flying objects in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The news and government have addressed this, they called them ""drones"". I think they should not be calling them drones because they really didnt know what they are, so they should be called UFOs. But for convenience, I'm going to call them drones. 

Even with news articles or reports time and time again; they never gave an answer to what they are. They described the drones as having a wingspan of 6 feet and they can travel as fast as 60 mph (and can travel even faster in some cases) and travel for many miles.. these descriptions are unlike any other drone that exists.

 I live in Colorado and I've seen at least 4 (if not more) every night that I'm out. These drones move so fast, they have blinking lights, sometimes multiple.

 I've seen four different types of drones. One that has 6 blinking lights. Three of them are yellow and bigger than the others, two are green and smaller than the yellow, and one is red and the same size as the green. I first saw that kind of drone when the sun was still going down and there was still light in the sky. I saw a shape against the lit sky that was harboring the lights. It was a diamond-like shape, with rounded edges. People have argued with me that this was a plane, but this was NOT a plane. It didnt look anything like a plane.

The next kind of drone that I've seen is one I've only seen when the sky was dark. It has one blueish-white blinking light. The light would blink about 6 times very quickly then go dark for a second,  then appear again in a completely different spot in the sky. They had straight paths though. They wouldnt just appear in a random spot. It was in a set spot. It was odd.

And the next drone that I've seen is one that looks similar to a plane. Almost the same lights, just a tiny bit different. And I can tell it's not a plane because they move so fast, a lot faster than a plane or a jet would fly. They can hover too. Which is something that a jet nor a plane can do. 

And four, this one looks similar to a shooting star. It has one white light. It doesn't blink. It also moves so fast. One time on my way home, I was close to my house when I saw one of these drones fly over my house. It moved so fast and it dissapeared into the night just a few seconds after I saw it.

 I've never seen a single one of these ""drones"" up close. I've only ever seen one when it's hovering or moving in the sky in the evening, since the drones all stay at least 300 feet away from buildings. 

There have been many theories about them. But the few most talked about ones are 
1.) They're aliens. 
2.) They're government aircrafts that are looking for a misplaced nuke that's somewhere in the Colorado/Nebraska/Wyoming area.
3.) They're drug carriers.

Planes have even had problems with them. With the drones flying too high, and getting in their way. The government have claimed that they're doing what they can about these drones.. but I've even seen articles where the news were claiming that ""the drones dont exist, and that they have never existed."" But many people know the truth no matter what the government or news says; these drones are real. The truth is here, these drones are real."

t3_f50sq2,all_ads,A memory that still kinda haunts me to this day,Thetruthishere,"So we used to live in a fairly safe , trouble-free apartment complex back in 2005 . I’ve spent my childhood there and some memories , mostly good ones stuck with me to this day . There is , however , one stupid moment that i can’t get over and put a meaning no matter how hard i try . So one day me and my friends were playing football , having a blast just like any other kid at that age until one of my friends stopped on his tracks and pointed at one of the apartment blocks with nothing but shock on his face , asking if we could see “ it “ . What all four of us were facing was a man , standing motionless at the edge of an apartment rooftop . Now this may not sound incredibly spooky to you but it scared us to death as 10 year old kids and we didn’t know what to do . We were looking at eachother , completely baffled until this man just jumped from the roof of an 8 story apartment building to his certain death . We bolted it out of there , went straight to our parents , all pale faced and shaky and this was probably the reason why they took us seriously instead of shrugging us off with “ kids being kids “ . Now here is the part which puzzles the crap out of me . Our parents checked the proximity for a “ dead body “ but to no avail . Officers arrived some time later for the same purpose cause apparently people alerted the emergency line about a suicidal man on a rooftop . So briefly this guy jumped to his death and vanished into thin air . We , as 4 ten year old kids witnessed him fall along with some other people who went as far as calling the police yet again there was absolutely no trace of a man what so ever . Have you had similar experiences like this one ? Or will this sh*t keep haunting me forever ?"
t3_f59yiw,all_ads,Shadow on the TV,Thetruthishere,"This happened when I was around the age of 10. My brother and I were watching TV with my parents in their room. It was nighttime, and the only light source on in the room was the TV. As I was lying down, I saw a shadow (waist up) walk across the TV. It freaked me out so I told my parents. They were tired so they didn’t give it much thought. I tried moving in front of the TV myself to see if a shadow showing up on the screen was even possible. It wasn’t. If I couldn’t cast a shadow right in front of the TV, there was no way my parents could have from their bed. And I’m pretty sure I would remember if my brother got up and walked across the room. Still not sure what it was to this day."

t3_f4yh8v,all_ads,A new Area 51 in Northern California?,Thetruthishere,"I posted this in a UFO related sub, but I thought people may find it interesting here too. Sorry for the length, but it involves three incidents that I believe are all connected. 

I have had three encounters involving UFOs between 2003 and 2005. I was born and raised in Northern California in the Sacramento Valley. It is an incredibly rural area surrounded by orchards and cattle pastures. On August 17th 2003 I was driving from my Grandmother's home in Gridley, California to my home in Live Oak, California. This is a roughly 7 mile drive, I take the back road, Township Road and at 10:00 PM, there was absolutely no one around on the road. 

I was surrounded by orchards and farm houses. My 1986 Ford LTD would always have electrical problems and it was no shock to me when my lights started flashing erratically on their own. The radio started getting nothing but hissing static. I pulled over, thinking my alternator was going out.      

     The moment I stopped the car, I noticed an incredibly bright blue light coming from across the street on my left. I looked over at the orchard and I saw a triangle shaped craft hovering about ten feet above the tree. There was a column of bright blue light coming out of the craft and illuminating the dirt on the ground. The triangle rotated slowly but made no noises whatsoever. Around the edges of the craft were pulsating blue lights, but every other feature of the craft was glossy black. 

The craft itself was very wide, yet it was probably less than six feet tall. My automatic locks in the car were moving up and down. I shut the car off and I opened the door, I was contemplating walking across the street and into the orchard to get a better look. The moment I stepped my foot onto the street I felt incredibly dizzy and nauseous. In that moment, I thought that something horrible would happen to me if I went closer to the object.

 This was before I had a cell phone and there were no cars anywhere around me. I quickly closed my door and tried to start my car. It started easily and I drove as fast as I could. I looked in the mirror behind me and saw that the craft was still there. I told my younger brothers, but I kept it to myself, mostly. 

This was a small town and I was already seen as the weird writer, artist guy. I didn't want to be mocked even more than I already was. To be honest, Beale Air Force Base is about 30 miles from where I saw the craft and the first thing I thought was that this had to be some find of test flight. Then I realized that if this were a top secret, silent stealth craft, why the hell would it be out in the open. This was a small town, but not exactly desolate. There were homes a few miles away from where I had stopped the car, if this was the government’s idea of a secret, they were doing a lousy job.

     A year later (I don't have the exact date, but it was in August as well), I was in Gridley, California at my Grandma and Grandpa's farm on French Avenue. They have eight acres of property and there are other farms surrounding them. About a mile away is a huge wildlife refuge called Grey Lodge. The stars light up the night sky because there is practically zero light pollution, especially on a moonless night like the one in question. My father and I had just bailed the hay in the pasture and we were staring up at the sky. 

Miles above us was an object zooming through the night sky, it was egg shaped and all we could really make out was a vibrant bright yellow light. My dad and I watched as the craft dropped rapidly toward the ground and suddenly stopped in mid air and hung in the air. If that wasn't odd enough, the craft shot back up and started doing loops in the air. My dad kept saying that this had to be from Beale Air Force base because of the way the aircraft was moving. It would hang in midair and suddenly appear on the left, then the right. It repeated these movements for about five minutes. 

Then, it dropped down, plummeting toward the earth. Once again, the craft stopped and hung in the air. This time, without any sound at all, the craft split in two sections, each flying in separate directions. My dad just shook his head and started complaining. “How much do you think this fucking bullshit costs us taxpayers?” I laughed at him and we both went inside. I wasn’t so certain that this craft was from the base. Nothing on this planet moves like that. This craft was so fast, it almost appeared to teleport. It’s movements were fluid and graceful almost as if the sky itself was water and it was swimming through a sea of stars.

     Living so close to Beale Air Force Base, my family and I would often attend the annual air shows. I’ve seen all manner of aircraft performing stunts and I’ve never seen anything move like that, let alone split into two pieces. My last experience also has something to do with Beale Air Force Base. It was on January 16th, 2005. It was my 23rd birthday and I usually try to celebrate with a solo driving adventure. I decided to drive from my Grandmother’s home in Gridley, CA to a small gold mining town called Grass Valley. It’s a very cool little town that has many of its historical, Victorian era buildings still in tact. 

There is also an abandoned insane asylum nearby that attracts ghost hunters. I just wanted to browse through the old book stores and shops. I was there for hours. At the time, I had a cell phone, but it wasn’t that dependable and this far up in the hills, the reception was a bit of a gamble anyway. When night fell, I decided to head for home. I had a much better car, a 1995 Oldsmobile. 

This car was a lot more dependable than my previous car, but I didn’t want to get stuck on the side of the road with a so-so cell phone. When I stopped to get gas, there was a beat up red studebaker pickup truck next to me. Its owner was a portly oldman with a long, bushy beard. As I pumped gas, he stared down the freeway and started laughing. I saw headlights coming our way from the highway. The old man turned next to me and asked if I lived around there. 

I told him no and he said that there have been a lot of military vehicles driving down the Nevada City Highway through Grass Valley for the past few days. He noticed that at around 8 or 9, a convoy of camouflaged trucks with government license plates would roll through town. Every single night it would be around the same time. It was 8:30 and a lot of trucks were headed our way. While it was dark, the lights from the gas station lit up the road enough to see the green trucks roll by. Each one had a canvas top over the bead of the truck. The first ten or so trucks were nearly identical military trucks. The kind you see in every episode of M.A.S.H. then there were two black Lincoln Continentals that drove past, followed by an enormous flatbed truck.

 A large black tarp was draped over a large, gun metal grey oval shaped object. There were two more Lincoln’s following the truck. After that, they were gone as fast as they came. I asked the old man where he thought they were going. He turned to me and laughed. I’ll never forget what he told me. “Don’t you know, Beale is the new Area 51.” Once he gassed up, the old man jumped in his truck and drove away. I drove back home with an eerie feeling. If this was a secret government project, this was a terrible way to keep a secret. "

t3_f4yngq,all_ads,Shadow person lucid dream encounter,Thetruthishere,"So, I recently realized after reading all of the ""shadow people"" posts on here that I may have encountered one a few years back.

A few years ago, I was super interested in Lucid Dreaming and trying to successfully lucid dream. During that time, I only had 2 successful Lucid dream experiences. This story is from the one that most stands out and scared the crap out of me. In the dream, I was driving my old junker truck down a dark, winding road near my house. It was night, and I realized that there were no street lights. I found this odd, because I knew that there were normally street lights on this particular road. At the same time, the truck started sputtering and eventually broke down there in the middle of the dark. I immediately realized I was dreaming, but the problem was, I was completely paralyzed. My windows were open and I could see around me because the moon was full and illuminated my surroundings. Then, I saw ""him""(it?) . a few feet away, on the other side of the road, stood a completely black figure. The moon was at its back and I could just tell that it was staring at me despite not having any features. At this point, I began to panic and told the dream ""If this is a dream, then i demand to move my body parts now""... nothing happened. I then tried ""I demand for the sun to come up and for there to be light now!"".... still nothing. I had taken my eyes off the shadow and when I looked back at him, he was noticeably closer. I was surprisingly calm, despite being terrified in this moment and continued trying to change the environment to no avail. I looked away again, and when i looked back, the shadow was crouched at my window. (looking back, this actually cracks me up because I have no idea what it was trying to do)  
At this point, I was trying with all of my mental and physical might to move my body, and i succeeded. My right arm decided to somewhat cooperate with me and I managed to fling it haphazardly across the rest of my body, out the window, and onto the shoulder of the Shadow. This was enough to scare me into waking up. I could be wrong and this could have just been a regular lucid nightmare, but the description fits for a shadow person, so I decided to share!"
t3_f4ihiu,all_ads,The room flashed red and a deafening crashing noise surrounded us...?,Thetruthishere,"My best friend and I are out of college, and this happened to us when we were both in the 5th grade together, around 2007. We are here together writing and recalling this story now.

We were both sitting in my finished basement watching “Salad Fingers”, that viral YouTube video that blew up around that time. There is a big window on the back wall of the basement, taking up almost the entire wall horizontally, which we were near at the time of this incident. Behind my house is a little yard and then woods for a half a mile before a main road. We were sitting next to each other in the middle of the room, with my laptop propped up. My friend was facing the horizontal window, and I was facing towards her.

While we were in the middle of the video, within 1 second, the room went completely black, flashed very brightly, and then pure red. We were still able to make out everything clearly; the room was just illuminated in a red hue. This was followed by the BIGGEST deafening crash coming from the big horizontal window that consumed the entire room. We whipped our heads over and saw the window wavering and shaking. We can best compare it to plexiglass being wiggled around. We both SCREAMED and our instinct in the moment told us it was that a deer jumping into the window. It was so scary.

After that, without any hesitation, we both looked at each other and BOLTED UP THE STAIRS.

My parents were upstairs relaxing in the living room. They looked at us and I asked, “DID YOU SEE THAT?” as my friend asked ""DID YOU HEAR THAT?"" They both looked at each other, confused, and said “What?” We described what had happened just downstairs a minute ago and they did not understand, kind of thinking that we just making things up.

Later on that night, we went downstairs to the horizontal window to see if there was any glass on the ground. There was not, and everything was in it's place. There was no electrical problem in my house at the time or any sort of red light, just regular lamps. We both leaned up against the window and pushed it together, and it would NOT BUDGE. We have no idea what that combination of events was and still think about it more than a decade later. 

Does anyone have any idea of what we could have experienced? We have been looking into the possibility of aliens or a glitch of some sort? Please let us know in the comments."
t3_f4njcq,all_ads,The JUMPING/Teleporting voice,Thetruthishere,"This happened literally minutes ago, and I will best describe what the literal HELL happened.

So, I was walking home after work, at around 11pm. 

Now, I’ve always been afraid of the forest that attaches to my property. It’s dark, scary and there was also a cougar attack in it. I did have a light, and my boxcutter, in case I need to use it, and right when I stepped foot on the gravel path of the park. I hear “huuu (Best I can describe it, if someone wants to help debunk it to be an animal)”. I almost lept out of my pants when I heard it, and it seemed to be coming from the direction of the stream nearby.

I quickly flashed my light in the direction, couldn’t see anything. Confused, I began walking into the forest more, just wanting to get home, when I hear it LITERALLY behind my back “huuuu”. That time I lept out of my pants. I scrambled backwards looking around for the thing making it. I yelled “WHO ARE YOU” “WHAT DO YOU WANT”.

That’s when the freakiest sh*t happened. I heard the noise about 500meters in the direction I was going to go, as my dad didn’t want my shoes muddy. It was like it randomly teleported in that direction, cause it couldn’t have gotten there that quick. 

I BOLTED home, as fast as I could. I quickly pressed the keycode and ran up the really steep hill my property has and all the way home.

I HAVE NEVER, Been SO AFRAID IN MY LIFE. 

I need some Biologists in here to try and help me to find what creature it is

I live in British Columbia CANADA, so, if you know any native creatures to do this, please tell me

EDIT: I just found out, it was a Barred Owl. I listened to calls on Youtube, and the Barred Owl sounded quite distinct and similar. Thanks for everyone’s help!!"
t3_f4mnke,all_ads,Static,Thetruthishere,Since the day i could remember i've had this strange reoccurring dream of pure black and white TV like static. There would be no noise and often it would look as the walls were moving. The feeling of it was claustrophobic and i felt entrapped or even had a feeling of suffocating at times. Almost three times a week i'd wake from these dreams in a puddle of my own sweat and once even had to throw up because i felt motion sick. I told my parents and they thought i was delusional or i had problems. I went to a therapist for a few years to try and ease the stress these dreams put on me. I told him what i was experiencing and he gave me a calendar to track the amount of times the dreams occurred. I know theres a conspiracy about reoccurring dreams and what not but it gets stranger. With my therapist not being of much help i called to the internet. Many people said they'd never had a dream like that and that it was very unnatural for a dream to be be so bland but so terrifying to induce sweat like a nightmare. Over the past few years things have simmered down. I rarely if ever get the dreams of being in a moving static void but if i do it still causes me to sweat bullets. My best guess is it's a phobia i have that's only triggered when i'm asleep as looking at static awake doesn't affect me at all. Whether this is a strange case of a phobia i only have while asleep or a weird phenomenon i'm not aware of yet i need answers because i haven't gotten one for many years.
t3_f4o9yh,all_ads,Unexplained Late Night Noises,Thetruthishere,"Here’s some context before I get to the strange noises: I moved into a new house with my family at the end of December. We moved to a new state and my parents had a house built, because it was the first time they ever were able to do so. I’m a broke college student that’s trying to save money where ever they can. So when my parents said I could stay with them and just pay $300 in rent a month I immediately agreed. I live in the basement with my parents room just above mine. The basement is a more modern day basement. Meaning it has a walk out (doors leading to the back yard) and full size windows. 

About a week after we moved in I got home from work a bit later than expected. Normally I work morning shift, but I got stuck working an evening shift and the night shift was late to replace me. So I ended up getting home around midnight. After I changed out of my work clothes I laid down in bed and was starting to drift off when I heard a loud bang outside my window. 

Now I’m an avid horror fan and a follower of real life unexplained phenomenon. However, because of this I’m very skeptical of things I can’t explain. So naturally I shrugged it off the first time I heard it and went to sleep. Then another week later I was woken up again by a banging. This time I blamed it on auditory hallucination. Like maybe I had imagined hearing it because I was just waking up. It made sense in my half asleep mind, but the more I thought about it the more I realized the noise woke me up so I couldn’t have imagined it. 

Around the same time I started notice a tapping noise on my window. That I later found out was caused from my parents walking above me and my vent not being secured correctly. So I thought the banging was being caused by something similar. However, this banging noise only happens late at night after my parents are already asleep. It happens every day for a number of weeks then goes quite for a week and starts back up again the same way. There’s never any foot prints outside my window in the morning and I’ve never seen someone standing outside when I go to check it out. 

I’m at a complete loss of what could be causing this noise. I’m really freaked out by it and I dread staying up later than 9pm because I know the banging will start around then. I know I’m not crazy because my mom has told me she’s heard it a few times and my dog normally starts to growl right before I hear the banging. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What should I do? My parents are talking about getting a camera installed facing towards the backyard corner my window is in, but that most likely won’t help. I don’t think the noises are human made. I don’t know what it is. I’m just scared and looking for answers. Can anyone give me some advice on how to proceed from here? What could be causing this?"
t3_f48fso,all_ads,My sister’s experience,Thetruthishere,"Hope this is the right place for this. 

Our mother died last month. We knew it was inevitable a couple days before. 

I had to leave for home because it was my youngest’s birthday, so my sister was the only one there when mom died. 

Our dad died over 20 years ago. This is relevant because, as my sister left the hospital that morning, a few hours after mom died, in the middle of a city, she saw a large deer at the top of a hill. 

And a smaller deer climbing the hill to it. And as she watched, the two deer walked off together, side by side. 

And I don’t know if she’s right, but she’s certain it was a sign that mom was with dad again."
t3_f4vurd,all_ads,Nothing but a question about dreams,Thetruthishere,"First I want to say that this isn’t super interesting or conspiracy worthy, I’m also going to post this to /glitch_in_the_matrix because these two subs seem like the best place for a post like this. 

I’ve had re-occurring dreams since I was younger. I remember the first one I had was very imaginative, it was a girl in a hospital gown, very grudge-like, dancing around my front lawn / driveway at the time. It felt very ominous to me and I’m unaware if the feeling began before or after those dreams, but there was a strong presence in that house. Once I heard crying coming from a room when no one was home and I called my grandma panicking and ran outside to wait for her to pick me up. Eventually the TV started turning on in the middle of the night in pure loud static. That never stopped leading to us moving out. My whole body would freeze and I would cover my ears until it ended. 

Fast forward to me, 23 now. My dreams honestly scare me and have been reoccurring since 19 or so. That also happened to be when I picked therapy back up, and I began having dreams of traumatic experiences with family members, most of the time now deceased ones are still alive in the dream and I’m younger. Then there are ones that seem like mumbo jumbo lost inside my subconscious; I’m always lost in the same places and running from someone. But then there are the dreams that leave me scared to go to sleep because they feel more like a memory I cannot recall. 

There’s this one house I’m always going to or running from, there’s something there that I have to hide from, a dark presence. Most of the time I dream of an attic-like hidden bedroom. I can’t help feeling like I know that room.

The other one hasn’t occurred as often as that but it left me with anxiety. I just remember watching a planet blow up, basically, the entire sky went bright and everything. I had my family beside me, and it gave me just a huge sense of apocalyptic dread.


I dream about water, sharks, drowning and tsunamis a lot, apparently water dreams are a sign of intense emotions so those make sense to me and may be why I dream of space sometimes too. I have been in a lot of planes as well. Mostly what gets to me is the eery feelings I cannot shake along with those dreams. I don’t know if it’s possible that I am seeing some other timeline in the past or future but the planet blowing up one especially gives me anxiety. And I keep expecting to one day find that room. 

Anyone experience dreams similar? 
Do you think it’s likely we’re able to dream in other timelines/universes/etc ?"
t3_f4dbee,all_ads,Has anyone else experienced this when knocked unconscious?,Thetruthishere," When i was 25, I was in a head on crash on my dirt bike with another dirt bike rider. We were out in the woods, and we were both going about 40 mph when we met in a blind corner. Of course we both had helmets on but a couple things stood out to me as strange. number 1, I remember avoiding the crash, and obviously I was wrong. I can assume that's probably due to my brain being scrambled and only remembering what i meant to do, and not what I actually did. The second thing is what really has me intrigued. I was unconscious for 20+ minutes. In that time I remember being unconscious. I was in a void. I had no physical body that I could tell. It wasn't light or dark there. There was also no concept of the passage of time, although looking back on it, I feel like I was there for a long time.  It was literal ""nothing"". Has anyone else been in this void?"

After getting out, (and also getting really bad vibes like very creepy shit) find out one of my friends was recording, we all saw the tape, and in one particular part of the tape, we heard like if someone punched a piano (like no joke) no one made a single noise in the shop. We were all scared are first and we were so scared we just went home, getting home I don’t know why, I got this feeling that someone was watching, and my intuition said that I should throw away the objects I robbed, I don’t know why but when I walked away from the shop I felt wayyy better.
But I got a question, was it a good idea to throw away the objects I robbed? Pls help.

My friend also robbed some stuff, a old clock and a lighter that could play music (how in the world?!) he said the clock was fine, but the lighter gave him really bad vibes and made him feel creeped. Can he keep it, or should also throw it? 

I got the tape of the piano noise now

t3_f426vw,promo_adult_nsfw,Seen my dead grandmother watching TV.,Thetruthishere,My grandmother died 3 years ago. She really liked watching TV especially fox television. After she died my dad and my uncles basically maintained her house without anyone really living in it. They claim the property is extremely haunted but they've never seen my grandparents even though they both have been dead for a while. They come clean the place and do maintenance on it because every time they try to sell it it just doesn't work out. Today I was there going through the kitchen throwing out expired food and making me a sandwich when I seen the tv turn on by itself in the living room. As clear as day I seen my grandmother in her rocking chair. I told her that she is dead and she looked at me and said honey that never stopped me from watching TV before.

t3_f4dxhc,all_ads,"UFO sighting, Texas",Thetruthishere,"This event happened in Austin, TX in July early 2000's. My then husband and daughters wanted to watch the fireworks in downtown Austin by the river. We went early so we could find a good spot to sit, so it was still daytime. We found one by the bridge, the one with the bats that fly out during sunset.

  


My youngest, she was 3 at the time, was thirsty so my ex took her to buy some refreshments. My oldest and I sat down kind of facing the bridge hoping we could see the bats before the fireworks started. It was already getting crowded and we could hear the usual stuff, people talking, kids playing etc. Then everything stopped and I notice a large shadow being cast on the ground. My daughter and I looked up and saw a huge triangle shaped black craft silently creeping above us. I remember thinking how on earth something that big would be able to maneuver around the tall buildings, it was downtown Austin. We both stared up at this thing for what seemed like ages, it was only a few minutes, when it just took off faster than I've seen any man made object move. Then at once there was the usual sound and people acting like nothing happened. My daughter and I just looked at each other but didn't say anything and the night went on as usual.

  


The odd thing is I'll forget about it until something sparks my memory, I'll ask my daughter if she remembers and she'll say ""oh yeah, that was weird"". I am posting this to keep it fresh in my memory and I'm hoping someone else might have seen the same craft around Austin in July early 2000's?"
t3_f4epl0,all_ads,Seeing my dad in my sleep,Thetruthishere,"Hello this is my first post on reddit!! I’ve had to re write it about three times because every time I stop my text that I write also deletes its self so not sure if the spirit world wants me to post it but here we go...

One night about three years ago I was asleep with my boyfriend, well he wasn’t asleep otherwise he wouldn’t have experienced what had happened. Basically I sat up and asked my boyfriend why my dad was at the end of my bed... (my dad had been dead at least two years prior to this happening.) my boyfriend said he told me that ‘he wasnt’ 

Anyways apparently after that I just went back to sleep. I do not have any recollection of this happening even when he woke me after it happening I just didn’t believe him and went back to sleep. Which makes me quite guttered in a way because I would have loved to have seen my dad again. 

Anyways has anyone else had experiences like this? I’m 100 percent sure my boyfriend wouldn’t lie about something like this as he was quite shook up by it and said he couldn’t get to sleep. He often brings the story up when we talk about ghosts to other people. In a way it’s quite nice because he never got to meet my boyfriend but they would of got on so well together!"

I'd like to hear from you!",Thetruthishere,"I couldn't figure out how to crosspost [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/f4e87p/anyone_here_experienced_a_skyquake/) discussion to TTIH but it seems like something that you folks are discussing. 

Basically, I've had a series of dreams about what seem to be 'skyquakes' of the sonic boom variety. From browsing Reddit's other paranomal threads I've learned that these sorts of 'quakes' 'booms' or whatever you call em, also tend to happen before sightings of bigfoot, aliens and in so-called thin spaces. So I wonder if there is a link between the booms and the paranormal.

The fact that my experiences are dream-based might sound like they are wishy washy but, believe me, they are anything but. They're realistic to the point where I start questioning whether I might be seeing another person's experience, telepathically. But at the same time, they're also paranormal as in, unearthly. So how would I know they're real? I'm not sure, it just feels that way to me. Weird, I know.

Let me know if you've experienced anything like this in real life - I'm keen to learn more."

There's another picture with some kind of moving mist anomaly in it. Make of it what you will.

So my sister shared these pictures with the ghost tour lady, and this was her reply (verbatim):

The closer I got the bigger it looked. I slowed down, like anyone would when an animal is on the road, and finally I got an idea of it’s REAL size. It was massive. It turned its head and looked at me and that’s when I noticed that it’s eyes were reflecting an orange light. Green and blue glowing eyes is completely normal but I have NEVER seen something with glowing orange eyes. Not yellow, almost red. 

It didn’t have to look up at me, it’s head was on my eye level, and I was in my car. After I saw it turn I hit the breaks in order to not hit it, and then it started across the road faster than anything I’d seen. I’m tired, but I don’t think I’m “seeing things” tired."

The second time was after 3-4 years, it was almost 4 in the afternoon and i was walking with my friends and i again see this very overdressed overjwelled woman. She passes by me and just makes a loud goat noise, i thought she had a goat with her and gave a closer look but nope. I was soo creeped out.

I was getting something out of the back seat and I looked up across the driveway and see two men standing  close together in 1920’s clothing and another  man in a 1950’s suit standing about 20 feet away  from the pair. They didn’t seem to be aware each other. Based on the body language. So I looked down and back up and they were still there maybe 5 seconds total. The two men were talking to one another and the single guy was just staring off.  when I looked away and back they were gone this time.   I never said anything to my friend.  This past summer he had me doing some work for him at the house. He had since moved out.  I was parked in the same lot but the opposite side and this time I was standing near the house. With my back to the house I look up from what I was doing and there are the same men  basically in the same orientation the two together and one standing behind to the left facing away from the two,  at an angle. The same as before but I can see their faces   All three are middle aged, dark hair. This time I see them for the moment I blink and they are gone. I think they just wanted to be noticed and let me know that they were really (still) there"
t3_f3mgj6,all_ads,What could have this been?,Thetruthishere,"So I live across from a old abandoned railroad line. The rail bed has been turned into and bike/hikeing/snowmobile trail and if you walk it you can still find old telegraph poles that have been cut down,concrete bases where the singles were and the such. Well the fall of last year my friend and I were sitting outside just enjoying the late summer early fall wearher. When out of the blue everything stoped. The crickets stoped doing there thing,the farm dog next door stoped barking and it seemed that there was no traffic on the high way that's around 150-200 feet away. Then both of us started to here a clicking nosie. Well at first I did' t think anything of it. Then it hit me the clicking was Morse code and it was the sound of a telegraph(for those who don't know telegraghs were used before radios to give orders to trains). Then as soon as it started it stoped and the whole world started again. So what could this been. Just the wind blowing or could it have been a operator send a order to a ghost train?"
t3_f3msq0,all_ads,"2 Mini ""Encounters"" In One",Thetruthishere,"I have 2 real ""encounters"" (if you can call them that), however they're too short for their own posts so he you go.

""Encounter"" 1.
This must have been around the year 2008 or so, it was a while back. I had just woken up, everything seemed normal but as I was yawning I realized that no noise came out of my mouth. Panicked I ran to the bathroom (Mind you it was about 8am, my parents were still sleeping) closed the door, and proceeded to try and speak. Nothing was coming out of my mouth so I tried to scream...nothing. I quickly ran back to my bed under the covers and proceeded to close my eyes and freak out a bit. After I opened my eyes again I could speak. Parents woke up a bit later, I asked them if I woke them up with my screaming. They seemed confused so I disregarded it. I believe to this day that something otherworldly played with me as I felt very unusually lethargic and short of breath/conciousness even after waking up.

Before you ask, no it wasn't my ears I could hear everything around me.
My parents would have heard me even with the door closed as the bathroom is across the very narrow corridor from their room.


Encounter 2.
(Still in same apartment on the 15th floor like the last encounter. I live in a cheaper/old person downtown region of a small but very populated city.)

This must have been around a year ago or so can't exactly remember. It was a normal night for the most part, It was probably around 3 am. I could not for the life of me fall asleep that night. I kept tossing and turning but could not fall asleep, suddenly with a loud voice I hear: ""GET DOWN ON THE GROUND"" followed almost immediately by 3 gunshots. As soon as I hear this I jump up from my bed and look down though my window, surely enough I see the red and blue lights and 3 cop cars. Curious I start looking around at all the condos and shorter apartments to see if anyone else is watching, but I see absolutely nobody. I must have been looking for a solid minute until out of nowhere everything becomes silent and I see no lights. As soon as this happens I hear 3 loud and fast knocks at my door with an ominous white light around the door frame.
Somehow I manage to fall asleep, but the morning after I was terrified. Weirdest part is, I tried for the best part of a week after to check the news and police reports on a shooting incident, but no matter how hard I looked, I found absolutely nothing.

I swear 100% on my life that these stories are true and factual, even if I cant remember the exact dates."
t3_f2zgqh,all_ads,Wall reflects weird non existing room in pictures.,Thetruthishere,"So, my friend just sent me these pictures (https://imgur.com/a/nIj2G5x) that he took with his phone a few hours ago (about 9:30 P.M.) in complete darkness. One was taken with flash, the other one without. He also didn't have something like night mode or anything similar turned on. I raised the brightness and lowered the contrast a bit on the dark picture, so you can see the room clearer.

As you can see, the wall in the dark picture reflects something that looks like a room, which is totally impossible because there is no room there to reflect. If there actually was a room that could be reflected, then why the fuck would the white wall be reflecting it and not the mirror? What's also weird is that dark and odd little stain on the reflection.

What freaks me out the most is, that the reflection isn't just a spot full of light, but a clearly recognizeable room.

As if this wasn't already scary enough, he claims to have had several sleep paralysis in this room. Does this maybe have anything in common?

What's going on here? I'm almost 100% certain that this is not a weird lighting mistake of the camera or something like that.

Thanks for any help!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he only sees the reflection when he takes a picture with his phone, not when he looks at the wall with his bare eyes. Sorry for any misunderstandings."
t3_f35vcg,all_ads,"Orange/red lights in the sky, when we mention the possibility of life out there watching us",Thetruthishere,"Three different times now, I and in two cases others saw lights in the sky right after mentioning the possibility of something watching over us.

A friend and I were on our way to a mediation group. We were walking down a hill talking about the grandness of life and how there's gotta be life out in the universe too. It got to the point in the conversation where my friend said, if there is life out there and they were able to listen, they would definitely be listening right now because this conversation is lit. I was like yeah man, and kinda sighed as I looked up. Right then, a bright orange/red light appeared and disappeared as it quickly moved from left to right across the sky. My jaw dropped as he said holy fuck did you see that? I was like uh yeah man. After some thought I have tried to explain it in a few different ways. It was a cloudy night so a meteor seemed unlikely. A plane or helicopter travelling through the valley was another thought, but wouldn't explain why it wouldn't have appeared before or after. The similarities in the next two experiences are interesting. 

I'm sitting on the beach with a few friends looking up at the sky, having a similar conversation as before. Life is awesome, the universe is big, who are we to think that we're the only life in existence. A friend said, I bet there are beings out there thinking the exact same thing that we are right now, looking up into the same sky. In the moment after he said that, the same kind of orange/red light appeared and disappeared after moving from left to right horizontally. Again my jaw dropped and was like anyone else see that? No one else did and the conversation continued, as I recalled the last time this happened. It was a clear starry night this time, so the possibility of it being a meteor is more likely.

My girlfriend and I are sitting on the beach during the day, its a clear sky except for this huge ominous looking cloud near the horizon. She joked with me saying, you know some people think UFO's can disguise themselves as clouds. I replied, if that's true, that cloud is definitely one of them because just look at it. In the next moment, a red light slowly appeared in the cloud and shined brightly for a few seconds then faded away, as we said lol holy shit look at that, then it came back for a few seconds again and then disappeared. I figure it could have been some kind of lightening like phenomena, I think I've read of balls of light like that being formed in thunder clouds before, who knows. 

The thought in the back of my mind, maybe there is life out there listening to these different conversations and are flashing their lights or something to fuck with us lol. Or there could be some other explanations like I mention. Who knows. Anyone else get flashed like this by ufo's as well? hah"
t3_f35e45,all_ads,Anyone else see white 'swooshes' that could be our spirits?,Thetruthishere,"There is a small handful of experiences in my life that I'm trying to understand and I want to share to see if anyone else has had similar things happen.

I sat down on the couch after a long day of snowboarding and zoned out for about a minute. In a moment, I realized how deep in thought I was and quickly snapped back to reality. In that moment, I watched a white swoosh in my vision drop down and pop into my forehead. My head kinda bumped back a little and then I was fully conscious in the room again, not lost in my thoughts. I didn't think it at the time, but now I figure that could have been my spirit flying back into my body after being away in thoughts somewhere...

Another time, I was lying in bed with my girlfriend staring into the back of her head. Suddenly, a similar white swoosh (as I describe it) dropped into the center of her head right as she began to readjust her position. She mumbled a little and then settled back down and continued sleeping.

I was dreaming one time when I suddenly realized it and quickly sat up in bed. I immediately did a double look of where my head was because I saw a ball of white light. When I looked back it wasn't there but realized what I had saw and that was an interesting start to the day.

There are a number of other times where I have seen this white light. It's not glowing or bright, but kinda a dull white or grey/silver. These experiences have really tripped me out. They've been on my mind a lot recently so I'd love to know if anyone else has had similar experiences or where I could learn more about this.

Edit: I'll share another one because why not. I was at a friends house and her adorable very wise looking dog came over and hopped on my lap. He looked my in the eyes with a very calm and sentient stare. Her owner, my friend, said to the dog ""oh hey buddy"" in a very high pitched babying kind of voice, as many do talking to their pets. The dog looked over at her and sighed, and I could kinda feel him thinking wow you're really going to talk to me like that, you know I can hear you. As he sighed, a white kinda push of energy kinda expelled from his head moving towards my friend. I thought that was pretty cool, and the dogs reaction was kinda funny, what a wise, chill dude."
t3_f2mwp2,all_ads,Wendigo? Skinwalker? Wtf is it?,Thetruthishere,"This is something my sister experienced about a week ago which was similar to an experience a friend of hers had a month before. 

She was sleeping at her boyfriends house (which backs onto a mountain with a forest starting in his backyard) when she decided to go get herself some food from upstairs. Her boyfriend refused to go with her as he had school in the morning and it was already 1 in the morning. His room is in the basement so she went up the stairs to the kitchen, on the same level as the rest of his family’s bedrooms. Because she didn’t want to wake everyone else up, she just used her phone flashlight while she prepared herself bananas and hummus. While doing so, she heard what sounded like large dog foot steps (they DONT have any pets) going to the bathroom which she recognized as it was squeaky. The door opened and closed about three or four times before finally closing. Then the footsteps progressed down the hall in her direction to a closet door where the same thing happened, only this time the door was left open. She tried to brush it off as a family member and went back to chopping her banana, out of the corner of her eye she saw what appeared to be a very large black figure slowly lean its way around the hallway corner to look into the kitchen. She looked up and it was gone. The same thing happened again, only this time it’s neck (?) Stretched out longer to get a better look at her. She looked up again and caught a glimpse of something with white glowing eyes before it disappeared back around the corner. At this point she was freaked out and grabbed her knife,  she quickly went around that corner to turn on the light before gathering all her stuff and heading back downstairs... when she told her boyfriend in the morning, he told her that that closet door, is not just a closet door it’s an empty room with the attic door in the ceiling. They went in the room the next day and found that paint had been scratched off of the attic door and the floor was scratched beneath it.

A friend of hers had a similar incident a month or so earlier when he was taking a leak in the backyard.. he looked up to see a tall creature with what he described to be white glowing eyes and huge teeth standing amongst the trees. Once it noticed him it ran off but then started coming after him once he starting running back towards the house. 

Not entirely sure what it is but whatever it is I really hope I NEVER meet it."
t3_f2wlch,all_ads,Shadow Person my friend saw,Thetruthishere,"I'll try to keep this story short. My friend (I'll call him Rob) lives in a medium sized two story house that's next to a large forest and an ocean. His bedroom is upstairs and it has two doors leading into it. One that's a bathroom, and the other is the hallway. There's a bedroom on the other side that mirrors this exact layout.

One night, Rob was on his phone getting ready for bed. On the bed he had his cat with him. Rob put his phone down and he looked in the corner of the room  where the door to the bathroom is, and saw a very tall shadow figure standing there looking at the ground. The shadow figure walked past the bed and through the wall that leads outside. His cat also saw the shadow figure, as the cat was looking at it and following its movements.

What's really strange, is that where the shadow figure walked, there's a loft and a TV in its place, so the shadow figure just walked straight through those objects.

Directly after this experience, he left his room and slept on the couch downstairs."
t3_f2byjw,all_ads,Deceased grandmother visits me from the “afterlife”,Thetruthishere,"I should mention I posted this on r/paranormal 

My grandmother passed away last October. I was particularly close to my grandmother growing up so her passing was very hard on me. I myself am a bit of a skeptic when in comes to anything in the paranormal realm. However, the experience I had still baffles me today and I cannot rationally explain what occurred. 

My parents were hosting a small bbq dinner and invited my grandfather over to spend some time with the family. I was the only person manning the grill that day and periodically I’d go outside and check the grill to make sure nothing was burning. After about 20 minutes from the last check I decide to go outside and check again except this time the grill was cold to the touch- I was the only person handling the grill and I made sure there was enough propane and that none of the connections were faulty. None of the gas knobs were moved either. I didn’t think too much of it and went back inside.
Inside, I told my grandfather about what just happened and he made a joke saying it was my grandmother messing with us. In that moment- specifically when he mentioned her name, all of the power went out in the house. Again, strange but we didn’t think too much of it. 
Later on that same night I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise originating from my night stand. I have a moderately heavy (8-10lbs) pink salt lamp that was knocked over on its own! It was out of reach from myself and my girlfriend as well, who I should mention was in the same bed as I and was also awakened by the noise. She rolls over and falls back asleep. It’s at this point I notice a fine silvery- white mist appear at my bed stand. I’m not sure how to explain this but somehow I felt a deep connection to that mist and knew in my heart of hearts that it was my grandmother visiting me. This mist proceeded to non- verbally (telepathically)communicate to me that I was loved immensely by it. It told me that it was my grandmother and to not be afraid, she told me not to mourn her loss so hard and to take care of my grandfather who was struggling to cope with her loss. She told me to spend as much time as I could with him because they would be reunited soon.  I woke up the next morning and tried to block it out mentally for the rest of the day. It wasn’t until later at work I started to cry seemingly out of nowhere and allowed myself to  feel my emotions that I realized what had taken place the day before. I still haven’t told my family in fear that they may not believe me or that it may trigger sadness.

I still get chills writing this because I know what I saw. I’ve had sleep paralysis before and am very familiar with the sensation- this was NOT sleep paralysis. Less than a year later my grandfather passes unexpectedly. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Thank you for taking the time to read this I know it’s long!"
t3_f2phrq,all_ads,Vanishing Man,Thetruthishere,"I've posted here before, and due to being housebound after an operation for the past few months, I've recently been spending a lot of time alone. It's been difficult, but all this time alone has afforded me a lot of thinking time; I've remembered some really wonderful memories and also some totally bizarre ones. After my previous post, i have started remembering so many incidences that occurred in my late teens/ early twenties. This is one of them.   


I used to spend a lot of time with my elder cousin and my friends exploring the countryside surrounding our town, drinking beers and just being young men up for adventures and killing time together. On this one occasion during a summer around 2009-2010, my friend Woody had a girlfriend over from Sweden who brought along a female friend of hers. We all went to the pub on the edge of town, drank many beers and, as it was summer, left while it was still light outside. We decided to head back to my cousin's house, pick up some more beers, smokes and acoustic guitars and head out to the fields to continue hanging out and making the most of the warm summer night. There were 6 of us present; Woody, Billy, my elder cousin Aidan, the two ladies Selene and her friend (can't recall her name) and I. We headed under the rail bridge, climbed the gate to the field and settled about halfway across with a clear view on all sides of us of the surrounding area. Not far off was a small power relay station, and beyond that the field continued towards woodlands.   


We started up a campfire and the beers were flowing. It was a lovely summer night where the sky was a deep, dark blue and the stars and moon shone down on us, illuminating the ground. We amused ourselves making songs with ridiculous lyrics and done the usual thing of trading amusing swear words and sayings with our Swedish friends. After a while, everyone was spread out in a circle around the fire and we were talking at a low volume. Out of nowhere, a man walked right past our group, to which my cousin said ""HOLY FUCK...shit that dude made me jump!"" as he choked on his beer and we all laughed as he had made all of us jump with his reaction. We were laughing at the situation for no more than 10 seconds when Woody cut in with ""Whoa...where the fuck did he go...?!"" as he looked around in the direction the man had walked.   


The man was nowhere to be seen.  


May i add that there really was no way this guy could have left the field so quickly without us hearing him climb the gate at the very least or seeing him. It was too much of a distance from where we were sat around the fire to leave that field in that amount of time. We all stood up and were scanning the area around us, all in total disbelief that the man could have vanished. I asked the others if they saw what he was wearing, as all i could remember was he seemed to be wearing a dark grey hoody with the hood up and i didn't see his face. Everyone confirmed the dark grey hoody, but not one of us saw the man's face, even though he almost walked right over where my cousin was sprawled out, at most a metre or so from him. We also confirmed that none of us heard or saw the man coming toward our group even though we were in the middle of a field with clear visibility for miles, and we would have definitely heard someone walking toward us across the grass at the pace the man was travelling.   


We decided to put the fire out and leave as this spooked all of us because it just made no sense at all. I never saw Selene or her friend again, unfortunately, so i couldn't ask them if they remembered this, but i know my cousin and i would often talk about this, and both Billy and Woody remember it to this day.   


I have never seen anything like it. There one second, and gone. I will link a picture of the area so you can see how this wouldn't be possible. Any ideas are welcome."
t3_f2mnaj,all_ads,Has anyone had an experience with THIS thing?,Thetruthishere,"I’m trying to pinpoint what it is but I cannot find information about it anywhere. I already mentioned a bit about it in my last post.... contacted through the Ouija board, replies with “hahahahaha”, has it out for my sister and threatened to do her physical harm countless times. I received lots of advice but I’m curious if anyone else has dealt with this thing.. it introduced itself as “jixi” (pronounced je-she). when put in google translate (because I couldn’t find anything about it) it is a Chinese word which means “mechanic.” Not sure if that is related to what it is or just what it calls itself.  powerful, literally can force other spirits off the board while in mid conversation with a huge shift in energy. We haven’t contacted it in over a year because every time we tried to use the board the answers we got were jibberish and then taken over by the repeated “hahaha.” But does anyone know what this is? Has anyone else met it?"
t3_f29cyy,all_ads,"Anxiety, gut-instinct, or something else?",Thetruthishere,"One night in 2016, I went to bed after watching some Tv with my mom. She stayed up for a bit longer in the living room downstairs, while I laid in bed. After scrolling through my phone a bit, my mom goes to bed, and falls asleep within 20 minutes (I know she’s asleep at this point due to her loud snoring). While laying in my bed, I am all of a sudden blasted with an overwhelming wave of dread and fear. The specific thought of “My mom is going to burst into my room crying tonight.” raced through my head and I had no idea why. This feeling lasted for about 5 minutes, until I was able to calm myself down and eventually fall asleep.

 At around 2:45 in the morning, my mom sprints into my room, flinging my door against the wall absolutely sobbing and in terror. She proceeds to tell me that she woke up and felt petrified. She said there was this feeling of someone standing outside of her door, and it was getting bigger, and bigger.She explained how she heard static and was too scared to move. Until she couldn’t take it and ran into my room. 

Obviously my first thought was sleep paralysis, but I can’t push the feeling I had and somehow knowing that it was going to happen ahead of time. This is still and probably always will be one of the weirdest things to have ever happened to me. Thoughts?"
t3_f2gunk,all_ads,Unforgettable Static Tv Experience,Thetruthishere,"In college and years after I owned the same tv until I bought my first flat screen. This particular tv had a VHS and DVD player mounted into the tv on the bottom. Never had issues with it. Except one particular night. I never owned cable in college, instead I just put in family guy dvds and set a sleep timer to turn off the tv. Since I only watched dvds when I would turn it on the tv would already be on the DVD home screen. This particular night I had the same bedtime routine. I had the  volume fairly low, the sleep timer on the tv turned it off and I immediately dozed off. Hours later I am woken up in a panic. My tv is not just turned on but is blaring loudly fuzzy static cable channels. In dazed and confused state I sit up immediately in bed trying to pat down for a lost remote praying this doesn’t wake my roommate up. I’m tossing around my bedsheets thinking I’ve hit the remote while sleeping to cause this. I’ve completely woken myself up to realize the remote was on my nightstand beside me the whole time.  I grab it, turned down the volume and turn it off. Quickly laying back down to go back to sleep. Not even a moments passed from the time my eyelids were fully shut and *Click* my tv is back on, just as loud as ever and I’m fully conscious knowing I did not do this. I sit up, grab my remote once again and turn the tv off. I wait for a moment thinking  to myself that maybe my remote has a glitch so I take the batteries out. Immediately the tv turn back on again. I’m staring at my tv in shock and this time I watch the tv start to flip itself through the static channels. I lean forward freaked out and hit the power button on the tv. The tv powers off and immediately powers back on again and without hesitation starts flipping through static channels again. Not taking anymore chances and being that I was exhausted and had school in the morning I unplugged it from the wall. I told myself if it came on again I was leaving. It never did.  Has anyone else had experiences like this?   

Updated info- 
       **My roommate was passed out in her room so I know it wasn’t her pranking me.
*** We rented a house in the country on roughly 5 acres of land with nearest neighbors being 2-3 miles away, so I don’t believe it would have had anything to do with someone else’s tv interference causing this."

t3_f236fr,all_ads,Someone ran across our rooftop..,Thetruthishere,"I was born in Clovis, New Mexico. I lived there for about 4 years, and there is one specific event that still puzzles me. One night, my mother grabs me from my bed in a silent panic and pulls me into my sisters room. She closes the blinds and huddles us into a corner, sister and I both shaken. As we sit still we all distinctly hear a set of foot steps running on our roof at a rapid pace going in multiple directions. She calls the bases SP (Security Police, we lived in base housing due to my fathers service in the Air Force at the time.) After that, the only other part I can remember is being outside with my sister, mother and I along with the SPs. Here’s the thing that scares me: 

1. We had a 6.5ft privacy fence that surrounded the entirety of the house. 

2. Our roof was peaked. There was no flat surface to be able to run across the whole roof, or any of it for that matter. 

3. There were no signs of ladders, stools, or footprints on the property. 

and 4. There were multiple other calls that they had received that night of the same thing happening to other homes. 

I have no idea what this could have been, and I guess I’ll never know. Any theories?"

They are everywhere, in everything, as if not only everything was made of them but as if they were some kind of primordial material that everything is made of. And they are not static, actually its exactly the opposite: they move really fast. The darker it is, the better I see them. And I also see them with my eyes closed.

I decided to post this here because I have no idea where to look for answers. Everyone to whom I spoke about this didn't know what I was talking about, until some days ago it happened that I stumbled upon a sub where this was slightly mentioned (in an unrelated post), and so I came to know that I am not the only one seeing them :)

But what are they? What is this? Is it some kind of eye malfunction? Or something else?

I've seen them for my whole life (I'm a full ass grown up, btw). I have no memory of, even for a single moment, not seeing them. They are as natural to my eyes to see as the oxygen that I breathe.

If I focus on them, I am able to form shapes made of them. Whatever shape I want them to.

Does anyone relate to this? Can anyone provide a reasonable and logic explanation to this?

If this is not the right sub to post this, please feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate one!

EDIT: I've been followed by several ophtalmologists since I was 5 because I have myopia. None of them detected anything wrong with my eyes except myopia.

My parents bought us gold pans and off we went down to a little river where people could go give panning for gold a try. We had little glass vials to put our collections in. I remember pulling in the parking lot and how dead it was. Not another car in sight. 
We got down to the river and got to work. Not knowing at all what we were doing. 
I had an old man come up to me. With grey hair and a long grey beard. Old style clothing. He taught me how to pan for gold. He told me it was a dying art and that he was glad to share his know how.

First time poster here and figured I could share one of the many experiences I have had with things I couldnt explain.

We moved a lot when I was growing up, all over the country and in places which ranged from young to old and lots of history.  Lived in homes with multiple floors, condemned trailer houses with no electricity or running water, everything in between.  I tell you that to tell you this: I am not unaccustomed with the unfamiliar.  My childhood was split between so many homes of of such a wide variety that I never had the chance to develop a fear of the unknown, the sounds and feels of a new place have never scared me until one time.

We had moved to this brick and Adobe house in eastern New Mexico, I was about 11 or 12, and lived there for about a week when I noticed a peculiar trend.  The pantry door would rattle at the same time every night like clockwork.  Honestly it sounded like someone trying, but failing, to open the door.

My bedroom shared a wall with the kitchen so I was essentially the only one in the house that heard it, but it drove me nuts once I noticed it.  I asked my dad about it and he said how it was probably the air con and pressure differentials. That sort of thing.  I dodnt think anything of it but that night I shut the air con off, set a timer, and waited.  The door rattled again, like clockwork.  It carried on for about half an hour or so then stopped and I went to sleep knowing it wasnt the air conditioning. 

The next day I brought this to my dad who was understandably upset that I had shut off the AC and stayed up so late, but he was understanding of my need to know.  His next theory was vibration from nearby traffic or a nearby railroad could be reaching some kind of resonance in that door frame.  He was satisfied and sent me on my way.  I was not satisfied.

I couldnt isolate traffic and the railroad because I cant control those things.  But I figured I would do another test.  That night rolled around and I shut the AC off, then opened my bedroom window and listened for the train.  I knew it couldnt be traffic, too regular, but the train tracks were relatively close and I knew from past experience I would be able to hear the train.

The door....rattled.


I listened for it to stop, reset the AC, and closed my window.  This time I did not tell my dad.


Thw next night I decided a more...aggressive approach was called for.  Before I continue I should point out something about this house.  Like so many older homes, it had an ever so slight lean.  The sort of lean where if a door is not latched, it will slowly move further open or closed depending on its position relative to this unfortunate axis.  The pantry door, notably, was positioned such that if it werent latched fully, it would slowly open, rather than close. 

So I set an alarm and waited till it was nearly time for the rattle to start.  I went into the kitchen, turned on all the lights, opened the pantry door, and sat cross legged on the floor to wait.  Sure enough, the moment came.

The pantry door opened wider than it normally would have in a sharp jerking motion, then it slammed hard enough to rattle the shelves and it rattled harder than it had ever done before.  It was like someone trying to get out of a locked room!  I sat there in awe, watching the spectacle as my parents came up to see what the ruckus was, seeing the door and everything. 

I dont quite remember my parents reactions, it was a whole lot of me being swept up and firmly guided to my parents bedroom where I was shortly joined by my sister and both parents.  Over the next couple of days dad tried replacing the hinges, adding a lock, and eventually just taking the door off altogether.  


Never did learn what caused it.  All I can say is that we had no other strange incidents like that at that house."
t3_f21ceb,all_ads,"Power of song, and how it helped my brother at Church Camp",Thetruthishere,"So, during the week, we have a little ceremony, where we gather all the chairs at the stage and make a little circle. We would sing Christian Music, and pray, and stick notes onto the crosses nearby, which was awesome.

Anyway, Here is some backstory:
My brother’s Counsler were having a little toss around, playing rough, when my brother bonked his head on the side of a Music Tower (which plays music to wake us up). My brother’s friends said that he was foaming out of the mouth for a little bit, as though he was having a seizure. He went to the nurses office, where he was in a bed. (Even though me and brother are usually fighting, we have peaceful times). I told him to get well and I walked away. 

It was at night and the time for some music. I sat near a couple of friends. We were listening to music, and I don’t know what it was, but the energy was POWERFUL, to the point where people were crying, cuddling, it felt like the world stopped, and God was watching us.
It came down to walking to the cross and sticking notes to the side. I walk up, right up to the cross, and wrote my brother’s name down and pinned it. I sat down with one of my friends who was crying. I sat down next to her, helping her out, when I notice my brother walking into the building. 
That’s when I bursted into tears and hugged my friend real nice. I said “God is good... God is good”. Keep in mind, my brother was in the bed for at least 4-5 hours since he came back. 

Anyway, it’s a quickie but a good one at best. Hope y’all have a great day"
t3_f21tyf,all_ads,Possibly experienced a past life in a dream.,Thetruthishere,"(Not sure I got the flair right, but the others didn't quite fit.)

Every night, I usually dream. Some are more vivid and lucid than others. Some I can remember certain details for days afterward. However, my dreams are mostly fantastical and wild. I know that they're dreams when I'm in them and dream logic applies to everything - except for one I had last night. 

I've never had a dream that was exceptionally realistic - where dream logic didn't apply at all, and that I could be watching real people having real conversations in a true to life world without any of those classic LSD-like effects. But last night I dreamt about a little girl in the late 1700s/early 1800s America. She was kidnapped by her father who then ran off with her and was both sexually and physically abusive toward her. He had kept her hidden in an abandoned house, but one day a band of Native Americans spotted him abusing her and they killed him and ended up taking her with them. I woke up after the rescue. 

Now, I've left out a lot of detail - but the odd thing about this dream was that it felt *so real*. Incredibly so - as though I was watching a full scene captured in time. I also don't know anything about 17/1800s clothing or houses. I haven't seen a western in a very long time, or any movies related to the time period. I don't really know much about Native culture - but all these things were crystal clear in my dream. I'm also usually in all my dreams, or at least participating in some way (however small), but I wasn't in this one at all. I was just watching everything happen, like an audience member. 

The oddest thing about this was when I woke up, I had felt - and when I say ""felt"" I mean a deep feeling inside of my heart and my bones - that I had just witnessed my own memories. I know that sounds nuts, but I really felt deeply that these were my memories coming back to me, that I was the little girl, and that I had experienced all of that. I *just knew* that this dream was me. I can't really explain it, but I woke up just knowing. 

But, it's not. None of those things had ever happened to me in a similar vein, and my dad has never and would never lay a hand on me or any of my siblings. I even racked my brain thinking that maybe I was suppressing something - but I don't think that's it. 

I've never experienced anything like that dream before. After I woke up from it, I lay in bed contemplating for about half an hour before falling back to sleep and proceeding to have my regular crazy dreams that make no sense (other than in dream world). Anyone else ever experience anything like this? I've never had a strong belief in past lives, but I also don't not believe in them either."
t3_f215ww,all_ads,Has this or anything remotely similar happen to you when you were little?,Thetruthishere,"ok, so I was around five when this happened:

I used to get up and silently walked around my house at night when my parents were asleep, usually carrying around something related to Thomas the tank engine. one night I was wandering and when I stepped into the small ""foyer"" that linked the living room and the dining room I heard a elephant trumpet and what sounded like drums, this scared the ever-loving daylights out of me and I remember running back into my room and hiding under the blankets until the drumming stopped. now I know that it wasn't a TV or any toy I owned at the time and to this day I still have zero Idea what just happened, anybody have any similar experiences? I would like to hear your responses!"
t3_f1oe9i,all_ads,My cat senses a ghost I sense as well,Thetruthishere,"So, I definitely believe in ghosts.
When I walk into a room I can sense the energy and hear stuff etc but  I hate it so I try to ignore it... it scares me..
My house is pretty big and my mom always tells me it has great energy and that there’s no need to be scared, but lately something weird is going on, I feel that when I’m alone something is watching me in my house, I see stuff in the corner of my eye like people walking by or orbs now I have a big imagination so I convince myself it’s all paranoia and imagination, but one part of my house proves me otherwise.
The entrance door is like in a small hall next to the kitchen and in front is the living room where I chill, for a long time I notice weird stuff in front of the door like I said orbs and movements and light, but I try to ignore , until my cat that lives out side started to look through the window in the kitchen every damn day and just stares at the door for hours  through the window and creeps me out, he seems as he is looking at someone/something and is fascinated by it,
I always get chills because I know cats sense stuff we don’t, so sorry this was so long but does someone have any advice or ideas on what’s going on? /:

Edit: 1. thank you for all the nice and calming comments! They really help(: 
2. I appreciate the concern and definitely sometimes you should get tested but I’m totally healthy and have been tested out and checked at the doctors (-: !

t3_f22via,all_ads,Bad Ouija Board Experience (Ongoing),Thetruthishere,"Here's what's been going on the last few days:

I'd been playing the Ouija board alone. Not smart, I know, but I only have one friend and he's impossible to catch at home. I'd convinced my mom to play at one point, and we contacted my grandpa, but she was spooked out over the planchette moving, so I didn't ask again.

Once when I messed with the board alone, I encountered a spirit that refused to give me a name. Every time I asked its name, it told me to go away. And I was repeatedly told to turn back during different sessions, and the spirits kept mentioning ""him"" but refused to elaborate on who him was. Heck, even my grandpa mentioned ""him"".

Looking back, I think they were trying to warn me. 

Now, I wasn't sure if the planchette was moving because of spirits or if I was subconsciously moving it, so I decided instead of just putting my fingers on the planchette I would make a point out of barely touching it. I even tried to purposely move it while I was so lightly touching it, and I couldn't unless I applied more pressure. So I figured it would be safe to say if anything happened it wouldn't be me moving it.

So I started asking my questions, mostly just different variations of ""is anybody here?"" For a few minutes nothing happened. Then the planchette started to move.

I have felt it move before, but this time was different, maybe because of the precautions I'd taken to make sure I wouldn't be doing it subconsciously. I just watched it move, muttering, ""I know I'm not doing this, I'm barely even touching it."" I was genuinely spooked out.

This is the entire conversation I had with the spirit, from the moment the planchette started to move:

""Is there anyone here?"" I asked.

The planchette started moving slowly, and I was spooked because I knew I couldn't be doing it with how lightly I'm touching it. Also, something just felt different this time. I don't know how to explain it. It felt like something was controlling the planchette, and I was just along for the ride.

Looking back on it, I think even the air in the room felt heavier.

The planchette started spelling out: f-u-c-k-y-o

At this point one of my fingers accidentally fell off the planchette and I quickly put it back.

""Are you still here?"" I asked.

The planchette moved to yes.

""What's your name?""

The planchette moved to Z, and I started thinking, oh no, don't tell me what I think you're about to tell me.

Z-O

At this point something touched my leg. I was alone in the room, there aren't even animals in there, but in my peripheral vision I saw a flash of something black and then felt something touch my leg.

I jumped and looked to my side, but there was nothing there that could've touched me.

""What the fuck was that?"" I muttered to myself. ""What just touched me?""

I was officially freaked out. I'd never had something touch me during a ouija session before. Not only that, I saw something. 

You ever see a shadow move out of the corner of your eye, and when you look, there's nothing there? That's kind of like what I saw. Except it was accompanied by something touching me in an empty room.

Yeah, so I was officially freaked out now.

I looked back at the board, and saw the planchette moving back towards Z.

At this point, I quickly forced the planchette to goodbye, put the board up in ten seconds flat, and ran out of the room. I did have enough presence of mind to store the planchette separately from the board, so that's a plus.

I ran outside and video called my friend Kylie, who's a very spiritual person, and told her what happened. She advised me to put some quartz crystal on the board while it wasn't being used, and to put quartz on the corners of the board next time I use it, to cleanse the negative energy. So that's what I did. I left her on video chat while I put the crystal on the board, and she said she could sense some residue in the room.

Super.

Later that night, I asked for a clairvoyant reading in a Facebook group I'm in for free psychic readings. This is what the psychic said:

""You have death around you, sudden death, but the possibility is always there.
There is also a warning to you. Curiosity has led you to some dark energy, this energy is harmful. I feel like you've discovered this, like events are happening because you initiated them. I don't think you're dark inside, you're still emitting light, but the darkness could engulf you if you keep going. It's all about intentions.""

Real cheerful, right?

I have to admit, it's eerie how spot on she was. I've gotten readings before, but that one was the most accurate yet.

I am obviously freaked out over this whole thing. I hadn't even been thinking about Zozo. I'd never encountered him before, and most of the stories I have read about him seem elaborated, so I figured he wasn't as scary as everyone said. But nothing could've prepared me for the very real fear I felt when the board started to spell out Zozo, or when I felt something touch me. How do you explain that? I was alone in that room.

I've been keeping a record of any other signs that Zozo might still be around. I smudged the room and the board with white sage, and when I did I felt cold and the whole time I had a bad feeling. Some other things I've noticed: my dog has been whining and keeps looking in the direction of the board, and my phone has been acting up. At one point, it randomly started playing music and I can't figure out why. It wasn't even music I had on my phone, it was just random guitar strumming. 

I plan to use the board when I get home today to see if Zozo is still hanging around. I haven't even been back in that room since I cleansed it, but eventually I'm going to have to check. I'm hoping that I closed the board fast enough to prevent him from getting attached. Not much has happened yet, and I'm hoping it will stay that way.

Update 1: Clothes I have gotten rid of have somehow ended up under the bed. At first I thought my puppy dragged them under there (she likes stealing clothes), but then I found a pink dress under the bed that I know for a fact I put in a box to be sold.

I had to shine a flashlight under the bed so I could see the clothes under there. At one point I set the light on the floor while I put something up, and when I turned around the light was gone. I got down to look, and it was halfway under the bed. How did that happen? I only had my back turned for five seconds. 

I guess I should explain why I was looking under the bed in the first place. Me and my mom are in a bad situation right now. We have no electricity or running water, and we're basically living in what used to be a storage shack. Our old house, which is on the same property, is being torn down, but there's one room that's still intact, and that's where I'm keeping the board.

The reason I was looking under the bed is because one of my dogs is on a tether, and we keep her inside when we're not there. We never take her off the tether because if we took her off outside she'd run onto the road, and if we took her off inside she'd probably try to kill the cat. Anyway, she likes to go under the bed, and sometimes she manages to get her tether tangled up around the bed frame. I have no idea how she does it, but she did that today, so I had to untangle her, which is how I discovered the clothes.

The thing is, we had had to untangle her just a couple days ago, and there were no clothes under the bed then.

I can't say for certainty if this is connected to Zozo, but it certainly is weird, and I'm trying to write down anything weird that happens in case it's connected. 

Update 2: 
I had to rewrite this because it somehow got deleted. I'm not sure how that happened, but anyway here's what happened next. 

So I knew I had to check the board and see if Zozo was still hanging around, but I didn't want to do it alone. I tried to see if Kylie or another one of my online friends could be on video chat with me while I did it, but they were both busy. So I had to do it alone.

I placed quartz crystals on each corner of the board, lit a candle, and sat down on the floor. Nervously I placed my fingers on the planchette and asked, ""Is anybody here?""

Nothing happened at first, so I kept asking if there were any spirits with me. Finally the planchette started moving towards M.
I was confused at first. Then it went to A, then back over to M, then A again.

For those of you who don't know, Mama is another name Zozo likes to use.

I was freaked out, but I asked, ""What do you want with me?""

The planchette swooped over to No, which confused me. Then it went over to Yes, then down to the corner below, then over to the next corner.

I looked it up, and apparently when the planchette moves to all four corners it means you have contacted an evil spirit. 

Joy.

I was starting to panic at this point, so I tried to say Goodbye. The planchette moved to No. At this point, it was going very fast.

""What do you want with me?"" I asked again. 

The planchette spelled out, ""AZAZAZAZAZAZ.""

Yay. Another one of Zozo's names.

I couldn't take it anymore, and I forced the planchette to goodbye. When I did, the planchette flipped over. I'm not sure what to think of that. I've heard that if the planchette falls off the board it means the spirit escaped, but the planchette was still on the board. It was just upside down. I suppose I could've accidentally done it with the force I used to move the planchette to Goodbye, but I can't be sure.

Another thing: when the planchette moved to the bottom corners, one of the plastic glide feet fell off the board, though the rest of the planchette was still on the board. I am not sure if this is a bad thing or not, but I'm going to find out.

I'm seriously freaked out and scared. I was hoping he'd be gone. The crystals and the sage didn't do a thing. I'm not sure what I should do now, and I'm scared of what might happen next.

Update 3: The following is a transcript of a text conversation between me and my friend, John, who is kind of an expert on these things. After telling him about the second ouija session with Zozo, this is what he had to say.

John: Holy fuck!

Me: Yeah...

Me: I would've called you but I knew your phone wasn't charged.

John: Hugs

John: And i was with family

Me: I really would've preferred having someone on video chat while I was dealing with that

John: No shit.

John: Wish you could have waited.

Me: I had wanted Kylie because she would've been able to sense anything off.

John: Nods

John: Lol thanks 😉 feel like im chopped liver now lol

Me: I have nothing going on tomorrow, and I really need to know if he's still attached to the board or not. Would tomorrow be good to video chat?

Me: I could do it when I get home tonight, but I really don't want to go near the board at night alone.

John: No dont and its around but not attached

John: The door IS closed

Me: How can you tell?

Me: It's still around but it isn't attached? To me or the board?

John: Either. But it isnt on our side of tte veil. You trapped it

John: But it’s around not happy

Me: I trapped it? How the hell did I do that?

John: When you said goodbye. It was trying to break free and you slammed the door on its foot. Metaphorically speaking

Me: The AZAZ thing

Me: So that's why he likes to constantly spell out his name?

Me: So he can break out?

John: Nope

John: It will attempt to have you not shut the portal when you use the board next. So it could be free, but right now its stewing

Me: How would it do that?

John: Scare you into distraction so you wont say goodbye. Or muck up saying goodbye

Me: Muck up saying Goodbye? How can you do that?

John: As long as you close/say goodbye and focus seeing any portals

Me: Anything else I should look out for?

John: It will try to scare you and try to have you, let it in. Like a vampire

Me: Come again?

John: Where did I lose you at?

Me: Letting it in like a vampire? Vampires need invitation to go in a house.

John: Yep and demons are known to trick people into letting them into a person/persons life

Me: Trick how? I want to know what I should watch out for.

John: Basically dont invite anything into you.

Me: Okay

John: And they love to impersonate

Me: I've read Zozo is a fan of impersonation

John: All demons are with the ouija board 

Me: So the question is, did me and mom actually contact my grandpa the other night? Is there a way to tell the difference?

John: Yea but its hard to explain. You would know, gut feeling and everything tells me this time you did

Me: Did contact my grandpa?

Me: After me and my mom finished, I contacted my grandpa again alone, and he gave me a warning. I can't remember exactly what he said, but I know he mentioned a ""him"".

John: Yea you did

Me: The spirits I talked to Saturday also mentioned a ""him"" and told me to go away, stop, turn back.

Me: Is there any way to banish him?

John: Let me work on that.

Me: Okay

Update 4: I sent pictures of the Ouija board and the room it's in to Kylie. She said the picture of the board made her want to throw up.

Joy.

Also, I did a tarot reading for myself. In the past position, I drew the five of Swords reversed. For present, I drew nine of Pentacles reversed. When I went to draw the future card, two cards jumped out of the deck. I took that as a sign and put them both down for future: the ten of wands reversed and The Moon.

I'm still a beginner tarot reader, so I often have to look up the meanings of the cards. It isn't exactly easy to memorize the meanings of seventy something cards. Anyway, here's the meanings of the cards in my reading.

Five of Swords reversed: though sometimes a good omen, it can also signify an escalation in violence, conflict, and power struggles. 

Nine of Pentacles reversed: lack of independence, confidence, freedom, security, or stability.

Ten of Wands reversed: having too much responsibility, stress, a cross that is too heavy to bear

The Moon: illusion, fear, anxiety, a difficult period or time when things are not as they seem.

I asked someone who's more experienced than I am, and they drew this meaning from the cards:

All is not what it seems. Keep your wits about you and do not divulge anything to those you deem a threat. An unknown event is happening which involves trickery and you are subconciously trying to find your way out of it. You also have lost a little of your independence but feeling less burdened as of late.

I'm currently trying to decide what my next move should be. Ideally, I would like to find a way to banish Zozo from the board. There's a couple spells I might be able to try. I'm also wondering if he will show up if I don't play alone, but I'm not sure who I can play with. Most of my friends live in different states, so there's only about three people I can ask: my mom, my friend Will, and my cousin Chris.

The last time I played the ouija board with Will, he tried to scare me by moving the planchette. Even if I don't tell him about Zozo, he will still probably move the planchette himself to scare me. Also, Will is damn near impossible to catch at home.

Chris...I'm not sure if Chris would even believe me, and I'm not sure if I can trust him not to move the planchette. I've never played with Chris before, so I don't know what he will do.

As for my mom, I really do not want her anywhere near a demon. My mom is a Christian, and she told me when she agreed to play to try to contact my grandpa she did not want to talk to any demons. And I don't want her talking to any demons either. 

So right now I'm not sure how I should proceed. Most of the spells I know for dealing with an evil spirits are for trapping it in an inanimate object or are exorcism spells. No one is possessed, so I don't need an exorcism, and it's already trapped in the ouija board. What I need is something to banish it from the board.

I'm going to continue to think about this and try to decide my next move. I don't want this thing around, and I'm going to find some way to get rid of it.


Update 5: Right now I am mostly just trying to protect myself. I made a protection charm bag earlier and have put it on a chain so I can wear it as a necklace. I've prayed to my patron deity and other gods I honor for protection, and I cleansed the room and the board again with white sage. I should note that I had difficulties getting the sage to burn, and when I went to smudge the board I actually had to relight it. The air in that room feels very heavy and oppressive.

I'm scared to touch the board again, at least alone. Until either I can find someone to play with or one of my friends is able to video chat, I'm going to leave it alone. I still want to know if he will only show up if I'm alone, and I'm still looking for a way to banish him from the board completely. 

I did write down one of the exorcism spells I found, which will allow me to imprison him in an inanimate object. But as I said, it's an exorcism spell; it's meant to be used to repel a demon from its victim's body and then trap it in an object. It's more of a worse case scenario spell right now. 

I'm also going to look through all my protection spells I've written down to see what would be the best one for me to use in this situation. 

If anyone has any advice, I'd be happy to hear it.

Update 6: I had a dream last night about the ouija board. I can't remember exactly what it was though.

I remembered something one of the spirits I talked to Saturday had said. It was the spirit who wouldn't tell me its name. It repeatedly told me to turn back, and then it spelled out, ""Get him.""

Very cryptic and foreboding. 

Also, in a twist of irony, I've found two posts on Facebook today ranting about ouija boards.

I commented on one of the posts about the irony of it, and told her I had contacted something malicious that was still hanging around. She told me to message her, so that's what I'm doing right now. With any luck, she can help me with this.

The first thing she asked was if it had windows. I said yes. She asked if they could be opened. I didn't know. I'd never tried. So I went to the room and tried. I was able to open them.

She told me to sage everything right now, and to put a salt circle around the board so it can't use it as a tether anymore. She said the windows open should make the energies disperse with the sage.

The first thing I did was nearly empty the sea salt pouring a circle around the board. I was very careful to make sure there weren't any breaks in the salt. I've seen Supernatural enough times to know how bad that would be.

Once that was done, I lit the sage and cleansed the room, repeating, ""You are not welcome here. Get out. In the name of the gods, begone. I don't want you here. Get out.""

Nothing seemed to go wrong. The only way I'll know for sure is if I use the board. When I do, it's staying in the salt circle. 

Update 7: I finally found someone I could video call to test the board again. I called my friend Rene and asked her if she could please stay on while I tested the board to see if Zozo was still hanging around and if he would show up if I wasn't alone. She agreed, and even got her own ouija board out so that technically I wouldn't be playing alone.

So I took the board out of the box, left the board in the salt circle, put the quartz crystals on the corners, and started asking questions.

It wasn't as scary talking to it with someone else there, even if it was over the phone. So here's what happened:

I asked if anyone was there several times before it started moving. It moved to Goodbye. Basically, it tried to blow us off.

Rene said something, and I asked if it didn't want to talk to me with Rene there. The planchette moved to No. Then it started spelling out its name.

Rene asked if it could hear her, and it said yes.

Then it started moving to the four corners. Rene told me not to let it move to the last corner, and I quickly stopped it, nearly flipping the planchette over when I did.

Then it started moving between the letters H and A repeatedly. Basically, it was laughing at us. I told it to stop, and it said no. Then it moved to the Z, then the O, then back and forth between the two. ZOZOZOZOZOZO.

""We know what your freaking name is!"" I said. I felt a lot braver with Rene watching everything. 

The planchette spelled out, ""b-i-t-c-h.""

""It called me a bitch,"" I told Rene, offended.

""Rude,"" she said.

The planchette was moving again. It moved to N, then all the way past the M to a blank area, then the A. I have no idea what it was doing and I am still confused about that. Then it moved downwards to the number zero, then moved over to nine.

At that point, I said goodbye and put the board up.

So the thing's still hanging around. It didn't seem to want to talk to me originally with Rene there, since it tried to say goodbye, but since we didn't let it it talked to us. It wasn't as scary since I wasn't alone, and Rene has a way of making everything seem hilarious. Still, I feel anxious.

A few more things of note, that might have nothing to do with Zozo but I'm still going to mention in case they do: After I said goodbye, I went back to my house and as soon as I walked in my puppy started barking. She's never done that before, so it seems very weird.

Also, I started shaking uncontrollably, and Mom complained about making her bed shake because I was leaning against it. I'm not sure what that's about either.

If anything else happens, I'll let you know.

Update 8: So I decided to try automatic writing. I'd heard some people contacted Zozo through automatic writing, and I wanted to see what happened. 

Well...I didn't get Zozo. I think I got Loki, my patron god.

It's not even in my handwriting. But I was just concentrating, having never done this before, and then the next thing I knew I was staring at words written in handwriting that isn't my own. This is what was on the paper. 

""Don't. Do not give it more power over you."" This was followed by three Nordic runes, Ansuz, Ehwaz, and Hagalaz, and then the words, ""Let me take care of this.""

I looked it up. Ansuz means ""communication,"" Ehwaz means ""horse,"" and Hagalaz means ""wrath."" So basically Loki told me to watch out and he's threatening his wrath.

In Asatru there's this thing called horsing, where a god temporarily takes you over, and I think Loki just did that to warn me not to use automatic writing to contact Zozo.

One thing's for sure: I wouldn't want to be Zozo if Loki unleashes his wrath.

Update 9: So there is water all around the ouija board and the salt circle, and there isn't water anywhere else in the room. It didn't rain last night. I have no idea how it got there. Anyone got an explanation?

Update 10: The water is still there. Also, the window in my house keeps getting cracked open. My dog has somehow gotten off her tether twice in the last two days, and I just noticed a box of herbs is on the floor, and I'm pretty sure I left it on the table.

Update 11: I have had a fucking terrible day. Came home from the laundromat and my dog got tangled up under the bed again, and we literally had to tear the bed apart to free her. Then my cat got out, went under the house, and is still refusing to come out.

On the Zozo side of things, I lit a white sage scented candle, put it on the board, and told it it needed to get out. The candle flame danced erratically the whole time it was lit.

Also, I received my emf detector today. I have gotten absolutely nothing in the room the ouija board is in, but I did get one random bleep in my house.

I finally talked to Will about what was going on. Unless his plans change, he's probably going to take me to the Catholic church Sunday to see about getting holy water to dispose of the board.

Any tips on how to blend in in a Catholic church?

Update 12: I sent a picture of the board with the water around it to the same person who told me to put salt around the board. She immediately told me to burn the board. She said it was trying to dissolve the salt, and if that happened worse things would come.

I can't destroy the board until I have holy water, so I have at least three more days of this, assuming Will's plans don't change.

Joy.

Also, I was trying to text something, and I accidentally typed out Zaza, even though I wasn't going anywhere near the Z when I was typing.

I have a very bad feeling about these next few days.

Update 13:
There is still water around the board today, but the salt circle is still intact. However, when I went in that room I immediately noticed a temperature drop. That room is colder than anywhere else on my property. It's a pretty warm day for February. Also, that room seems darker than usual. I mean, there's no electricity, so it's always pretty dark, but there are windows so the sun always shines through and lights it up pretty well. The air also very very heavy and oppressive. 

I took the emf detector in there. At first, I didn't get any signal. So I said, ""If you're here, can you make the emf beep?""

Silence. Then, one single beep from the emf.

I looked at it in surprise, not really expecting anything to happen. ""Can you do it again?"" I asked.

Nothing happened. I asked several more times for it to make the emf beep again, but nothing happened again. I eventually gave up, put down some more salt, and left.

Update 14: I'm not entirely sure that this is Zozo related, but I feel like it is because ever since I first contacted the damn thing my animals have been acting crazy and keep almost getting themselves killed.

My dog Butterball's somehow got off her tether twice. My other dog, Lucy, not only got off her tether but out of her collar. They have trashed the house multiple times while we were gone. Butterball nearly killed herself getting tangled up under the bed. A hole in the floor allowed the cat to get out and under the house (but we did get her back in last night), and before she got out the window somehow got cracked open twice.

Then today, Butterball got stuck under the house. She crawled into a hole we had dug when we were trying to get the cat out, got stuck, and here's the weird part-time hole was filled up when we found her under the house, and there were bits of trash blocking her way too, trash that wasn't anywhere near the house.

While we were digging her out, both me and my mom smelled the most awful smell. It was like a sewage.

I can't say for certain that this has anything to do with Zozo, but the fact all this is happening while this demon thing is going on makes me suspicious. And then there was that smell...

Thoughts?

Update 15: I looked up a list of signs of demonic attachment. I think I'm still in the infestation stage, judging from what I found.

I talked to John about the weird things that have been happening with the animals. He thinks it may be possible I'm dealing with more than one entity. Maybe Zozo called for backup because he's still trapped. When he said this, I immediately thought of the spirit I talked to that wouldn't tell me its name and said to ""get him.""

Things are getting worse. I need help. If there's more than one spirit, getting rid of the board probably won't help. If getting rid of the board doesn't work, I'm not sure what to do next.

Update 16: I went in there this morning to test the spirit box and nothing happened. Not only that, but the room felt normal. It wasn't any colder than normal, it didn't seem darker, and the air wasn't oppressive. I didn't sense anything off.

What the hell? Is it gone? Why would it just leave?

Update 17: I talked to John. He and Loki are apparently responsible for this. Here's a transcript of our conversation. 

Me: Did Loki do something? It is suspiciously normal in that room. It's not cold, not dark, the air isn't oppressive, the water seems to have dried up...

John: He did

Me: What did he do?

John: I dont feel Zozo around and your puppers should be back to normal

John: Considering the dreams I had...

Me: What happened?

John: We astrally fought the demons

Me: Oh...

John: He definitely tapped into my anger though

John: Holy hells im sooo angry still

Me: ...

John: Well more i am very aware now how angry i am

John: I will be fine later

John: But yea im seeing how treuly angry i am and he used it to power boost us

Me: So it's over now?

John: It's done.

So it looks like it's over. I've put the ouija board in the garage and am going to sell it as soon as I can. It can be someone else's problem.

Loki has been given the rest of my Valentine candy as a thank you offering. I am so relieved and my heart feels lighter.

If activity ever starts up again, and I think it's related to all of this, I will post here. But I think it's over now. I can relax now."
t3_f20ku2,all_ads,The night I realized something was at the end of my bed and holding my feet,Thetruthishere,"I recall this memory from when I was living in my old house at the time, and stayed in that house all the way to when I had a incident, or needed help, and me and my mom moved out and I live now in a different area.  I rather keep some of the info on this to myself because it will not go into the story.  Anyway, I was sleeping in my bed, sharing the room with a family member, and it was when I was about 14 or 16. I was sleeping in my bed, and it had to 12 when I woke up. But the real question in my head is ""what is this warm pressure on my feet, and why does it feel like fingers and a thumb?"" I remember trying to pull my feet away but it only dragged my feet much closer to it. So I started thinking in my mind of what to do, until I realized it was communication to me through gently tapping my feet with the fingers, as grabbed around my hand. I don't know how to describe that. It was gently tapping my feet just like that. So the conversation went for a time, and then when morning came, it left. I wondered about it, but I wondered who was that?"
t3_f1e4oa,all_ads,A random encounter,Thetruthishere,"When I was about 13 or so I was home alone for a few hours. I was up in my room playing with Legos with the door closed. I eventually got board and got up to grab the door handle and before I could grab it, for 3 seconds the door knob turned back and forth very violently. After the state of shock faded. I went all through the house and prove to myself that I was still alone. I couldn't explain it."
t3_f1g3wu,all_ads,Why is dad in the corner staring at me?,Thetruthishere,"The house I grew up in always gave me a strange feeling. I absolutely hated being alone there, the best way I could describe it is feeling watched in the worst way possible. Like someone was always staring daggers through me. Throughout the years my family and even some guests experienced some strange things there, but being skeptics we weren’t sure what to believe. The logical part of me wants to explain away what I felt there but I truly don’t have answers. A family member passed in that house shortly before we moved in and I remember ripping out the blood stained carpets in the room he had died in. That became the guest room, and then my room in my teenage years. 

There’s a couple odd stories about this house I could tell you, but this is the one that always gets me. I don’t remember experiencing it since I was only 4 yrs old, so the story has been told back to me by my mother who was with me.

One night my parents had gotten into a nasty fight, mom was pissed and told me to come sleep with her in the guest bedroom. It was sometime early in the am, 2am-4am maybe, when I woke my mom up. She said she awoke to me nudging her asking her to wake up, wondering why dad was in the corner staring at me. She told me nothing was there, but I was adamant that he was there looking at me. We went back and forth, her telling me there was nothing, me insistent dad was there. She was freaked out, decided to leave, and tried getting me to come with her but I was stubborn and wouldn’t leave the bed. I told her to come back and just look, she didn’t lol. So she just left me there, and for whatever reason I refused to leave. 

Talk about creepy fucked up shit your kids say huh? Mom thinks maybe it was the old family member that died in there, being that he had the same build, hair, and similar facial structure to my father. I still haven’t decided what to think about this story, but it creeps me the hell out."
t3_f1mnpl,all_ads,This is starting to weird me out.,Thetruthishere,"So ive experienced this many times in the past but not in the same volume as I did yesterday and today. Let me elaborate.

1. In the morning I was thinking of taking the dog out and I had a thought that there was a 90% chance/feeling  when I took the dog out for a walk it would go out the door storming and bark at someone or something.When it normally it dosent do that.Well turns out thats what happened the momment I opened the door.
2. Later on the day I was cleaning my yard from some leaves and they didnt seem to have any bugs attached to them so I threw them at the rubish thinking what was the chance there would be a bug there crawling out of the trash can when I would use it again later?Seemed like a funny idea at first but it wasnt when I checked the can later.
3. Next day (like 4 hours ago today,yes I woke up to post this) early in the morning I had trouble sleeping and I was thinking of my days when I was in an emergency department in my country on how when we were sleeping we would wake up in the middle of the night when the emergency signals and trumpets would play and how quickly we would wear and grab our gear and weapons and head to the emergency point.Yeah guess what....my house's security signals popped of warning my about potential intruders just when I was thinking about all the chaos.

What in the fuck?

Like I had previous experiences with potential ""synchronicity"",like thinking about stuff and then very shortly after they happened or checking the clock and knowing already what time it was but never in such quick succession."
t3_f1l1ge,all_ads,The Man in the Forest,Thetruthishere,"It was a snowy day and I was in 6th grade at the time. My friends and I had wondered back to our normal hang out spot behind the lake which was close to our houses. We went there all the time so we never expected anything different. As we walked down the path into the woods a man in a chair sat there and smiled. The only odd part was he had no face, you could just feel the smile coming from him. All three of us saw it and quickly turned and ran. We went back to the spot an hour later and no trace of any person was found. I went back here countless times since and no encounter, but I always feel something in the woods since then. 

Roughly 6 months ago (I’m now 17) some friends and I were investigating an abandoned house off the beaten path of a golf course. As we entered the woods I felt the same exact way as I had years before and quickly asked them to turn back to which they denied. I haven’t seen the man since, but whatever it was wasn’t a person"
t3_f1gh47,all_ads,Haunted House,Thetruthishere,"I grew up in haunted houses, or more likely, a haunted family. 
One of the scariest points of poltergeist activity happened when we were living in a townhouse. We moved in when the other side of the home was empty, a family lived there for a few months and it was empty again. The last people to live there at the same time as is, were straight up Gypsies. They gave and off vibe and were questionable. During their very short stay (apparently wanted to fraud and such, literally just up and left, we checked the home because the backdoor was unlocked and they literally left everything) and after, activity in our house definitely went up.
The story I’m telling is after they left.

There were three bedrooms on the second floor, two next to each other, one with my older sister and me and my little sister share the other, and the third one, for my mom and my little brother, on the other side of the bathroom in the hall.
It was passed midnight and I was in my older sisters room cause my little sister was asleep and I was bored. We were watching a show, just some late night tv. I was on the floor next to the bed while my sister was on top with our little poodle on the foot of the bed. I was just chilling and she was on the phone with her boyfriend. Just minutes after she was done talking to him, we were startled by her closed bedroom door shaking violently, including the doorknob, as if someone wanted badly to get in. It was shaking so hard it seemed like the walls were shaking with it. 
And then it just stopped. Me, my sister, and my dog looked at each other scared and wide eyed. She called her boyfriend while we decided to probably check the house to make sure no one is inside and the rest of our family is okay. She grabbed a bat by her bed as we gathered the courage the leave the room. We slowly opened the door and used the flashlights on our phone to scan the area. We checked my room next door and my little sister was sound asleep, both of us surprised as she is a light sleeper. 
So we checked my moms room, her and my little brother sound asleep as well. We double checked my brother cause he likes to play games, but he’s not good at faking to be asleep and he didn’t budge.
We checked downstairs in the living room, dinning room and kitchen. No sign of anyone else being inside. No sign of anything to cause the door to move as it did. 
We stayed up till the morning that night together, when we told our family what happened, they didn’t believe us. But it’s something that still unnerves us."
t3_f1gcya,all_ads,I feel like I predicted my cats death,Thetruthishere,"So I guess idk if this counts but I kinda just need to get it outta my head

My cat died a few years ago. She got an infection after being spayed. 

Now, I got her when I was 12-13 so not spaying her was not my decision at first. That was up to my parents and for whatever reason they decided not to do it. There was no way for her to get pregnant so I guess that’s why. 

When I was old enough, her going into heat was annoying so I decided to get her spayed. 

I scheduled her appointment once. For some reason right before that surgery I had a feeling she would die. I actually even asked my boss if taking off work for her death (which had not happened) was a valid reasoning. That first time, I canceled the appointment. 

I was so anxious about her dying that I didn’t reschedule it until few months later. This time I had the same feeling of dread but I didn’t listen to it. This time she did get the surgery and 2 days later she was gone. She had gotten an infection and because the vet was an idiot she died (he didn’t prescribe her antibiotics and continued to assure me that her not eating and not really moving was normal and “just post surgery pain.” When I took her to another vet it was too late)
I still had that bad feeling after her surgery but who am I gonna trust, a “professional” who has done his job for 10 years or my anxiety, which had always been irrational. 

I still don’t understand why I had this thought that she would die from this. Complications with spay surgeries are rare. She was seemingly heathy (I even got her bloodwork done before surgery to make sure her kidneys and liver were okay which could be affected by anesthesia due to her age) There was no reason for me to think she wouldn’t be okay. But I had this horrible feeling anyway and it was right"
t3_f1m9n8,all_ads,Um there’s was just a bright light outside my window what do I do???,Thetruthishere,"So Um, literally I woke up to a sound like a car motor or something at like 11:40-something and It sounds like it’s coming from my window or something so I get closer and all of a sudden I see a dark figure pass by my window and I’m like oh maybe somebody’s just walking outside, but I glance back at my window and I see what looks like two figures walking with what looks like a tree? Weird I know. And a couple minutes after that, a white bright light shines into my window and it leaves with the sound of the motor (which was actually pretty loud a that point.) the thing is, i live in an apartment complex so basically there’s a sidewalk outside of my house, then some grass, then another apartment buildings driveway. There’s has never been a car in this apartment complex that has been so loud I can hear it through my window (which has plastic in it bc it’s cold outside) Also, I don’t know how the light could have been a car because it was so bright and almost looked like it was shining directly into my window. After that I heard some sort of shuffling sound inside my house and there were a few more shadows outside. I don’t know if the noises were in my head or my cats, but it made me so scared that I got my defense rock. Anyways, just thought somebody might have any possible answers of what this could have been? Also sorry for poor punctuation and grammar and spelling. It’s 12 am on a school night and I’m in a rush.

Update: everything turned out fine, nothing really happened other than the shadows outside my window and stuff. Not much evidence of anything happening the next morning. So yeah, everything turned out fine. (^: ooh no I think I lost defense rock ),:"
t3_f0w2au,all_ads,Brother visited my fiancée (continuation of story from yesterday).,Thetruthishere,"Since people asked on my last post, I got permission from my fiancée to share this. Some thing to note before getting into what happened. My brother died when I was 13 and we were both in a car accident. My fiancée never met my brother. Never seen photos of him before this.  My fiancée is bipolar, extreme highs and extreme lows. We had been dating for 4 months at the time and just moved in together. I didn’t know at the time but she had gone off her meds. This all happened while I was at work and she told me about it later.

She went out for a walk to get some air because she was feeling really claustrophobic, the start of a manic/depressive episode. It got to the point she thought dying would be the best option and standing at corner she thought the best idea would be to just walk into traffic. As she took a step off the curb, someone grabbed her and pulled her back and turned her around into a hug. Arms wrapped around her telling her she doesn’t truly want to do this, that everything will be okay, that she is stronger than she realizes and it isn’t her time. Told her to just breathe nice slow deep breathes. She looked up at him and said thanks. Turned around to wiped her eyes and when she turned back the person was gone.

She told me about this when I got off work and she wanted to put up a post online to see if she could find the guy to say a proper thank you for his help and saving her. It was when she started saying what he told her and describing him that my heart started beating fast. I knew who helped her. She described him as being 17-18, athletic, slightly taller than her, dark brown shaggy hair, big freckle/birth mark under his eye with a blue shirt that said J.S. Jenks in yellow letters. It brought be back to the visits I got in the hospital. The shirt my brother wore on the day of the accident and when I saw him by my hospital bed. 

I told her I know who helped her and I can’t explain it. I told her it was my brother and she said it was impossible. It was a real person. She got mad at me for suggesting it because she never believed in ghosts or spirits or anything like that. Very sceptic. I asked her to please trust me and that night we drove to my parents house and I went into the basement and found a picture of my brother and asked if that was who helped her and her face went pale and kept asking how it was possible. I had no idea what to say because I didn’t know either but told her how he came to me in my time of need and looks like he came to her in her time of need.

Still crazy to think about and definitely can’t explain it."

t3_f0m8vp,all_ads,I had conversations with my brother before I found out he died week before,Thetruthishere," UPDATED

This is the first time I’m actually writing about this. So when I was 13, my older brother (18) and I were on our way to a movie when we were hit by a drunk driver. I woke up in hospital 4 days later, having lost my right leg and other leg in cast along with other injuries. That night I woke up to my my brother sitting by my bed telling me everything will be okay and to go back to sleep. 

   Next day parents came to visit and see how I was doing. I asked why my brother wasn’t with them and they looked at each other but didn’t say anything.  That night I again woke up to brother sitting by my bed again telling me he knows I can get through this and I need to be strong and overcome this and not let my injuries stop me from living life. We talked a bit, him not answering specific questions but answering more general questions. Remember asking him why he was still wearing clothes from yesterday because that was very unlike him to wear anything similar to what he wore the day before.  He didn’t answer that but when asked how he was he said better than he thought he would be given the circumstances. He reminded me to be strong and keep living and not let anything stop me and how much he love me before telling me I should get some more sleep.

  That next day parents again came to visit me in hospital and I again asked why brother wasn’t with them and they again looked at each other and it was only after I said that I would like family visit together and not at different times and would like brother to visit during day when we can talk more, instead of at night that my dad asked what I meant and I told him Andy had been coming at night to visit. My mom broke down and left the room. My dad then told me that was impossible because Andy died in the accident instantly. I didn’t believe it and argued it and ended up having to be sedated. That night I had no visit and next day parents brought newspaper article about the accident. 

 Years later my fiancée had an experience and having never seen a photo of my brother, she described him to a t and what he was wearing. That is a story for another time, but it was nice knowing brother is still around and looking out for me and those I love.

t3_f0uiit,all_ads,Can I sense death,Thetruthishere,"On Feb, 5, 2020, I was in class 8th period and and the whole time I was in class I was getting a feeling of dread, worried, and sad. It was so strong I was tearing up in class. I had a thought, is my dad dead. It was all I could think about. So class ended 2hrs later and I'm on the bus home. I immediately called my dad and said I was worried about him. He said he was fine. Well what do you Know. 2 days later on Friday I see my dad  and he tells me at 1:30, 2 hours after I called him, he found out his cousin died in a horrible traffic accident on a highway in Belize. The truck in front of him which was carrying lumber had a loading rope fail and it made him crash. This is the 3rd time we have lost family like this in less than a year. 

So my question is, can humans ""sense"" tragic events or death especially of a family member or loved one."
t3_f0yaa9,all_ads,Dimitri,Thetruthishere,"I didn’t think I’d have another post to add here since the last was dealing with something I experienced as a child, but this past week I’ve had a couple weird experiences. 

I live scary movies, video games, and stories. I live for them, like I’m sure most of us here do too. I am very easily scared though, and typically will be a wuss when it comes time to crawl in bed. I’ll play a happy song on my phone before bed, sleep with my back to the wall, the usual “I am a scaredy cat” things. Well, I went to bed Tuesday night, not really that scared despite having watched a couple videos of people reading scary stories about home invasions. I crawled into bed on my left side, turned out the light, and closed my eyes. That’s when I heard something that truly scared me to the bone. “Steven.” A name I haven’t gone by in over a year, whispered in my right ear. The voice was that of a man, but not one I recognized. My eyes shot open and I looked up and behind me to find nothing was there. I was shaking, unsure if I should try to turn on the light or not. After a few moments, I reached for my light and turned it on, confirming the voice was not of anything I could see. 

Two days later, I had a long day at work and hadn’t been sleeping well. I decided I would take a nap on the couch while I waited for my dinner to be delivered. I laid down on my left side and shut my eyes when I heard a familiar voice, this time in my left ear (the one on the couch pillow). “What was that?” It whispered like before sounding like it was only an inch from my ear. It wasn’t as scary as before, mainly because I had heard it once already and this time it wasn’t coming from a direction that made sense. I was still a little shaken, looked around, and decided to go back to trying to nap. 

I haven’t heard it in a couple days. I don’t know what it is though and it is kind of scary. Part of me thinks it is an auditory hypnagogic hallucination, though I have only ever had full hypnagogic hallucinations (audio and visual) and only when really sleep deprived (was up for over 36 hours) on a couple occasions in my life. Whether it is a real voice of something speaking to me or not, I don’t know. My friend told me to keep him informed and that I should name the voice to make it feel less scary. I was hesitant since I know they say names have power, but I decided to give it a name anyways. The first name that came to mind was “Dimitri”, so that is what I’ve been calling him. Hopefully it’s just my imagination, but I’m not letting my guard down too much."
t3_f0o2bm,all_ads,Our resident ghost finally let me hear her speak,Thetruthishere,"In my house, we have a little girl spirit that likes to hang around. My mom is rather sensitive to paranormal things, and with our little girl, she’s heard her (one time saying “I love you mommy” in the middle of the night while I was dead asleep, one time her voice saying “Let me be your teddy bear” in my mom’s ear along with the Elvis song of the same name that was playing) and has had recurring dreams with her standing by her bedside. Both of the speaking instances happened either a decade or more ago, and my mom doesn’t like to “scare” me with her experiences, so I don’t really think about our little girl 24/7. 

About a month ago, I was home from college for winter break. On our second floor, my bedroom is at one end of a hallway, and my parents’ bedroom is at the other. That morning, my dog had been running back and forth between bedrooms and begging to get onto someone’s bed (she’s a shitzu mix, so she can’t exactly do it herself) only to jump off again, so my mom and I were yelling back and forth to each other about who was going to take her. Finally, we settled to just let the dog sit by herself at the top of the stairs, right outside of my bedroom door. All’s fine and dandy, so I got relaxed and prepared to get back to sleeping in. 

But just around the corner from the entrance to my bedroom, I heard a girl’s voice clearly say, “It’s okay to sleep.” I didn’t know if she was talking to my mom and I or if she was talking to my dog, but it still woke me up completely.

Her voice almost sounded like it was coming from a loud TV, but my mom and I were the only people home—and my dog can’t talk. I’m an only child, so it wasn’t a sibling playing a joke. We live in a neighborhood where everyone knows everyone, and I know for sure no random girl had broken in. 

My theory for a few years has been that our little girl is a leftover, if you will, of whatever happened on our property before it was developed and we built our house on it. The entire town used to be totally covered in farmland, so I don’t think it’s out of the way to believe that our property is a section of a bigger one that was split into pieces for profit. 

Putting explanation aside, I was way more excited about the whole thing than I was scared. It felt like our little girl finally trusted me—maybe because I’m an “adult” now? Even if I’m only 19. Maybe because she really likes our dog? The dog IS pretty dang cute. Either way, that night I told her (or, the room at large?) she could play with whatever she wanted to in my bedroom as long as she didn’t wake me up. I’m back at school now, but I haven’t had any updates from home about anything like this... yet!"
t3_f0nfsf,all_ads,“The dogs”,Thetruthishere,"About four years ago when I was 16, my younger sister and I decided it would be cool to see if we could contact our recently deceased grandma using a oujia board. For quite some time everything was fine, we managed to contact my grandma one time and she told us that she loved us and our mother. We contacted a young boy through the board called Ryan Mcmillen many times. He said that he was 10 years old and had a really strong energy to him when we first started talking to him, when asked questions he would answer in seconds. We were sitting in my sisters room when we asked him “do you know Dorian?” (Our grandma). He replied yes. When we asked him how, he simply replied with “the dogs.” At first we were really confused but it hit me when I looked behind my sister and saw the two dog statues my sister had taken from my grandma’s house after she passed. I still feel weird whenever I see them."
t3_f0iow2,all_ads,The dolls are changing their positions on their own,Thetruthishere,"Backround info:

There is a small room upstairs in our house where my mum has a small collection of the dolls (she no longer collects them) with porcelain heads and hands and legs which are almost immovable - they are manufactured to remain in a stand position (this is important). They have been standing on a shelf with  their heads  straightened (when you are standing directly across from them they are looking directly to your face) for more than 20 years without any moves or falling (some of them even in our previous house which I don't remember, because I was very young when we moved away). Note: The room is full of needless things and apart from me no one goes there and I go there about three times a year usually.

All the incidents meanwhile:

The first weird thing happened last year on 11th August when I went there looking for an old german dictionary. I was searching in the library at the opposite part of the room and suddenly a doll almost fell on my head. It confused me, because there should not be a doll standing on the library, all of them were always on the shelf. I turned around and saw an empty place in a row of the standing dolls on the shelf. But who would did it? My mum has a trouble with walking and wasn't upstairs couple of years and my dad goes only to a room with a solar inverter. I put the doll on the table under the window and went away (I had to do something).

I returned there on 19th August with the idea to put the doll back on the shelf. But immediately after I came there I saw that five dolls were sitting on the shelf with their heads turned to the window (but the one from 11 August remained in an unchanged position). The four of them were the closest ones to the door, the fifth one was a doll dressed as a countess in red.  I quickly found out that put them back to the standing position was very difficult (you have to do this very slowly and must be careful). I did it, but still didn't understand how would be possible they had been able to change the position of their bodies and heads on their own and even looked like if somebody had arranged them. I decided to keep an eye on them.

I went to check them out once more that day and found that my effort to make them standing was useless. That time SIX of them were sitting on the shelf (five were the same, the new one a doll dressed as a countess in blue). The new doll had head turned to the door, the five other faced to the window again. I didn't try to put them back to the right position, because I was already afraid of them. I ran away from the room.

I took courage to go there at the end of the August. The six were sitting in the same position, but the doll which I had placed on the table under the window wasn't there. She was standing on the shelf with family albums which was under the shelf with other dolls. I put the doll back on the table and went away.

For couple of months the dolls didn't move (I was going there to check them), but when I went there at 21. 30 PM CET tonight, only four nearest to the door were sitting. Two countesses are standing again, but how can doll change a position from sitting to standing on her own?! I even didn't check the one which should be on the table under the window.

No other signs of anything paranormal in the house right now. The dolls are completely covered in dust, if somebody living was moving with them, they wouldn't be.

My question is: What to do with them?

UPDATE 1:

[https://imgur.com/a/dqDryeF](https://imgur.com/a/dqDryeF)

Yesterday I scattered salt at the doorway and put the crucifix on the left side of the table (very much on the left, can't be seen in pictures with the doll) in order to face directly to the dolls.

Today I have read comment sugesting to take a picture at least. I took the doll which has been moving around a room from the shelf with albums and put her on the table to make a picture of her (sorry for  bad quality, it was done in a hurry). I took it at 13. 29 CET PM and left.

I came back an hour later and saw the scene didn't look like I left it and I am 100 % sure nobody was upstairs since I left, because I was in a living room whole time and from a place where I sat I would see if somebody went upstairs. The first thing which I noticed immediately was the crucifix stood next to the doll on the right side and was facing me (east) not the dolls. I checked the picture I took with a position of the doll and saw the doll moved too (but a little one in comparison with her previous moves). I took another picture of the doll at 14. 33 CET PM.

The third one shows a mark in the dust where was the crucifix placed at first. Another bigger update will be after I got the camera. I probably won't be here tomorrow and after tomorrow, because of Sabine storm.

UPDATE 2:

The other dolls: [https://imgur.com/a/x0h48y6](https://imgur.com/a/x0h48y6)

UPDATE 3:

If anyone read this, the situation is normal, I removed the doll which was moving around the room and the other dolls remained still since. I will check the other dolls regularly at least to the August, because between the original incident and the last one was a six months gap."
t3_f0nv9e,all_ads,Vaccination hallucination fun,Thetruthishere,"I was 4 and about to start school. I had the triple antigen vaccine and we went to my aunty’s farm, as she and mum were going to knit me a school cardigan on her knitting machine (remember those?). Mum and I were sleeping on the fold out lounge, where the knitting machine was set up. 

I hallucinated all night and lay there telling mum all about the little people made of bubbles who were on top of the knitting machine (for some reason, I called them Martians).  They were very busy doing something. 

I still believe they were real. I also think the hallucinations I’ve had on mushrooms and morphine were real too. 

Have you read “the Doors of Perception”, by Aldous Huxley?  He also thought many hallucinations were glimpses of another reality."
t3_f0nr7b,all_ads,There is an entity attached to my sister,Thetruthishere,"So I know I just posted about another experience but I’ve got to know if other people have had weird experiences with this specific thing or similar occurrences. 
4 years ago, my sister and I became ADDICTED to using the board, to the point where we were using the thing every single day for probably two months. We could not put it down without feeling a sense of longing for it and I honestly don’t know why. We ran into some creepy things but we could usually shut it down by disconnecting. That was until we ran into a certain entity by the name of “Jixi or Jixie” I haven’t contacted it in a long time so I do not know the correct spelling. It originally pretended to be someone else who we contacted a lot as we were CONFIDENT that that person was safe, however there was a sudden shift in energy one day which threw us off and caused it’s true identity to be revealed when asked. The entity told us that it was constantly able to watch us through the paintings we had in our house and was anchored to the Phoenix painting we have on the wall of our stairs. It also threatened my sister at the time (2016) saying that it would kill her on New Year’s Eve. It’s been 4 years since the threat but each year we still worry. After contacting that entity our house became plagued with what I can only assume to be a poltergeist for over a year. My sister and I sleep on the top floor while our parents are on the bottom floor. Footsteps could be heard going from my room to my sisters room pretty much every night as well as banging from the attic. One time the door to the guest room swung wide open while my sister and her friends were in the room and my mother and I were in the basement with no one else in the house. (The kind of doors that you have to put a decent amount of force into to push open, a slight breeze would not open this door). Whispers have been heard on the stairs where the painting is located, overall it was creepy af. After that incident on the board, each time we tried to contact another spirit (cause we were addicted and brushed it off and also wanted answers) jixi would take over, we would know it was her because of the dramatic energy change and the repeated “hahahahahahaha” or insults to my sister. After a year or so the weirdness died down, but there’s always the occasional whispers or sighting of figures. 

Has anyone else had experiences similar to this or with THIS entity?? I haven’t been able to find anything on it anywhere. I don’t know if she is a demon or a poltergeist of what, but she has latched on to my sister and goes everywhere she goes."

I really have been avoiding talking about this or searching for answers because I am terrified of the possible explanations. I am a 20yr old female in college and I am seriously at my wits end with this. 
Since I was a child I have had many “paranormal” experiences. I used to spend summers at my friends house (built in 1640), I would often hear footsteps and voices even when we were alone in the home. I was 9 years old when this started. 
Ever since, I often find myself hearing voices/sounds, seeing shadows, feeling things, or seeing things move. It is not frequent and has only happened in particular places, until now. 
I am living in a pretty modern apartment (last 10 years). I have begun to see shadows or see/hear things move VERY frequently since about October 2019. 
It is starting to feel like maybe I am being followed by a spirit or am more in tune to spirits? 
OR, should I consider seeing a psychologist for something mental? There is 0 history of schizophrenia or anything similar in any of my family members. Is it me? Is it the buildings I’m going to? Am I being followed?
This has been tormenting me for years of my life. People often ask me if I can communicate with spirits or if I am more in tune to the spirit world. Could it be this? 
I am desperate for any advice or answers! Please help me and thank you!"

Since I was 9 years old.,Thetruthishere,"I am almost 27 years old now, and I have had the same dream since I was a child and I need some help. It has taken me a really long time to figure out where to ask these questions and I do have a lot of questions about a lot of other stuff to but for now, my dream starts the same every time I am in a meadow I am normal very comfortable being in while I’m awake, everything around me has a purple Hugh and I start walking to my house across the farm and everything is going from purple to a rusty orange color like I am dreaming in color, sound, and feel, but everything is like an old picture. When I get to my room that is completely empty I look out my window and there is a thing coming to the house through the field, and it’s a man made completely out of sticks and twine and his car is like an old model T  made out of sticks and twine like a bird nest, he is dressed like a well dressed scarecrow in a suit nice hat pipe and all, and i gets worse feeling and I hear the downstairs door open and see my parents walking up to him so I run outside to stop them but I can’t say anything or touch them and when I try to get near him to pull on him his face is so terrifying, where I can normal do what I want in my dreams he makes me go into sleep paralysis instantly and I wake up and can’t move for a few minutes sometimes I even forget how to breath like literally forget how to do the one most important thing I was born knowing how to do. But the worst part for me now That I am older is, every time I manage to get up and look out into my woods which is always my first instinct and it never occurs to me until after it happens but every time I look I swear I see a shadow at the wood line staring at me and a weird warm feeling and I have always brushed it off as shadows from the trees in the morning but that makes no since anymore because it disappears each time and I’m done denying it and just need opinions at this point. I am a studying witch and I have been since I was 8 but I have never messed with anything even slightly demonic my mother and my grandmother made sure I knew to stay away, but helping people can drag in bad things to and I am a little worried."
t3_f0753f,all_ads,Weird encounters ive had over the yeaars,Thetruthishere,"Aliens:

1) saw a man in public once who was almost fully clothes with the only exception being his hands and face (but was wearing sunglasses. It was a hot day so him having such amount and thick clothing on was weird, however, the clothing wasn't baggy. What was strange to me was his arms were extremely long, compared to the reast of his body and looked like his elbows bent the other way. like if he was to get his arm naturally his hand could easily touch his shoulder blade.A way to describe this man's proportions is; open and editing program and get an image of a 6 footman. then squish the image in on it'self slightly from the sides. doesnt grow in hight but becomes unnaturally thin, tic-tac looking head etc. but edit his arms to look unnaturally long. thing how sonic characters arms look, almost touching the floor from the tips of their fingers.he was interacting somewhat with his surroundings and people did notice him there (swerved around to get past him) but nobody noticed how oddly dressed or how oddly long his arms were? looked about 30.  


2)Another time was ufo i saw out of my bedroom window. Saw a weird looking shape in the sky one time. about dusk. think the triforce from the legend of Zelda. 3 triangular shapes where each point had a blue-white glowing orb on it. 9 glowing orbs in total as the triangles didn't meet, leaving way for all 9 glowing orbs. the triangles were faintly outlined with lines. tried getting a photo of it on my ds as i had no mobile at the time but the quality was too poor to even bother with it. it hovered around the place for about 10 ish minuted before vanishing into thin air after i looked away for a second or so.  


Unexplainable  


1) encountered a weird woman.  She was telling me about demons and the sort. that night, i fell asleep alright but woke up to hearing howling in the distance. wasnt one of our/neerby dog, and didnt sound like an animal eoither, somewhat human. fell asleep as i didnt think much of it and woke up to a black room yet the lights were still on? like if someone but a sheet of black plastic over my eyes but you could still barely see through it. my eyes were fully opened and i could sit up and move about alright as i needed the reastroom. went back asleep and woke up at about twilight. most heaviset thing felt like it was pressing down on my chest, like an elephant calf was sat on it. i closed my eyes and heard that howling noise again but felt like it was coming from ontop of me, it was loud and send me into a panick. i saw the woman again a week later and the first thing she said was 'did you hear the howling too?' and told me she went though something similar. she was in her 40's and i was 16/17 at the time.  


2) Saw some goat-man humanoid figure when iw as in a forrest on a trip with primary school. it wasn't Halloween either and his body proportions looked to good to me cosplay.  
His legs bent in tht natural deer/goat looking way and i know this illusion can be pulled off decently well if you look at fursuits but this was bent SO much that it couldn't have been a cosplay suit. His arms looked overly-hairy and he had little Stubbs as horns. he was in the forrest, sat on a rock with a cloak on. i started looking at him then i noticed him standing up to take his cloak off. He wasn't wearing anything and his body was human liked but 'cut off' to goat legs at his belly button section. his feet looked aprt human, part hoof also. his face looked more diamond-shaped, akin to a goat but still had human esque features like normal eyes, mouth, nose, by what i could tell.  
This was not appart of the 'experience' of the trip as we went to do bird wathcing and to collect leaves and acorns for a school project. Nobody else as far as i'm aware saw it and i'm not in contact with anybody from primary school to even ask.  


  
3) Recently on the bus home from college, i saw a flying figure in the sky, it wasnt a bird or any kind of flying machine like helicopter or drone etc. It looked similar to the grim reaper without his scythe. torn up clacked-ghostly looking thing. i'd say about 200 feet up in the air. just flying there, not fast, just havering about pretty much. not doing anything, just like it wat he does as a hoppy/to relax yourself in his past time. I saw him for about 10 minutes as there was a road blockage due to a car-van crash. I overheard people speaking to eachother about tthe crash a few days later and one of them said 'yep, both drivers died aswell as a passenger in the van'.  


4) I once saw a white, blonde woman on their laptop minding their own busness in a caffee. I was outside waiting for someone and looked around and then looked back into the caffe and where that woman was sitting, a black man was sat there now. Shaved head, bearded, with glasses on. same laptop, cup of drink was in the same place. I thought nothing of it as 'she could have left and he took the spot?'  
3 minutes later the person changed again. this time He looked like an indian, shaved man with long hair, and an ear piercing. I never saw the white woman or black man walk out of the caffee and there was only one exist."
t3_eznryu,all_ads,"When I was young, I would try to remember what was before the physical “me”",Thetruthishere,"I’d say I was around 5 or 6 years old when I remember doing this almost daily. I became almost obsessed with trying to figure out what I was before I was created. I know it sounds odd for a kid that young to think those things -but I did, I don’t know why,  I just did. I vividly remember spacing out sometimes and trying to picture who I was or what I was before “me” was a thing, or more so what was before life itself. I actually accomplished this on many occasions as I recall.

All I can remember is I would deeply think on it on certain occasions and all of the sudden I would feel an “awakening” per se, a faint memory would be played out in my mind and in my vision as well other senses. I can vividly recall these memories. “Me” wasn’t really a thing at all I was kind of just an observer kind of like when your looking around on google earth - a 360 view all around but I wasn’t a thing I was sort of just a conscious floating around. No matter where I looked or moved it was the same thing, a very dark and endless space. It wasn’t a room or place it was sort of like outer space but with no stars or planets. Just a dark nothingness all around. 

It was very cold I remember it would make me physically cold when I would “remember” those memories, as if I was back there and living in the memory. Now that I think of this nowadays all I can think is this was something similar to purgatory I was remembering. I was conscious but I wasn’t a person or thing, and it was nothingness all around me for what I could see was forever and ever. There was no thought process in myself there I was only witnessing where I was. 

Is this just the result of an active child’s imagination or something more serious? I haven’t experienced anything like this in probably over a decade or so and I’ve always heard young children are more likely to understand the other-worldly or paranormal so it makes me curious."

Hi! First time poster here, long-time lurker. I’m not sure if this is the right flare to add to my post so please let me know if it isn’t.

A bit of background before we get into the story. For as long as I can remember I’ve experienced strange things. Usually it’s just hearing voices calling me or seeing various entities, etc. This particular story is more of a series of events that led to a conclusion.

As a kid, there was one incident where I was walking home from the neighborhood pool with my brother and a couple cousins. I reached the crossing a minute or two before them and decided not to wait for them. I looked both ways multiple times and not seeing any cars I started crossing the road to the next crossing and my brother started yelling at me to stop. I turned to look back at him and he asked why I didn’t stop at the intersection. When I told him that I did and looked several times before walking, he told me that there was no way that I could’ve stopped because they weren’t that far behind me and if I did stop I would’ve seen that it wasn’t safe to cross. I argued back that it was safe to cross when I started crossing and he looked me dead in the eyes and said “if that car hadn’t stopped, you’d be dead” and that’s when it dawned on me to look around again. There was a black sedan with tinted windows sitting just inches away from me. I hadn’t seen or heard it drive up.

So between the ages of eight and seventeen, I almost drowned several times. The last time was probably the scariest. I was at a youth camp with a friend’s youth group and we had gone for a swim in the lake during free time. So a group of us decided to swim out to a boat to go jet skiing. It wasn’t a very far swim, maybe about a couple hundred feet or so, and I wanted to ride a jet ski in an environment where it wasn’t storming. 

Halfway there for whatever reason, I decided to turn back. I swam back and once I reached a spot where I know I could stand, I stopped but as my right foot touched the bottom of the lake a hand grabbed my right ankle and pulled me under. It was gripping me so tightly I could feel the claws digging into my skin. I struggled and called for help until I heard a voice say “stop struggling. No one’s coming” and I felt myself go  limp and be pulled further under the water. Right as I was beginning to lose consciousness, I was pulled out by a girl I had just met. She helped me back to the dock where I coughed up a lot of water and cried for a bit. It’ll be five years this summer and to this day I can still feel the hand gripping onto my ankle with the force to crush it.

After I got my license, I spent a lot of time with friends when I could. The first time anything weird happened while I was driving, I was out with a friend and we’d run a few errands for her mom before going to pick up her cousin. We stopped at an intersection and the light had just turned red. As we sat there, I watched the light change from red to green and so I accelerated thinking that it was a standard green light, but it almost felt heavy if that makes sense. I describe it as feeling kinda like I was in a trance. My friend started yelling “op, op, what are you doing? Op, stop!” and I snapped out of whatever state I was in and realized that we were seconds away from being t-boned and possibly killed by this massive white van. I moved back into my original spot and I kept trying to tell my friend that the light had been green but she didn’t believe me 

After that, I started getting into accidents, mostly just minor things like accidental bumper taps. The second of the three I was in (which was the most major), I was driving to a job interview and my vision went white. It was almost like someone put a white cloth over my head and by the time I could see again, I was plowing into the back of another SUV.

About six months to a year after that, my parents took me to see a therapist because they  were worried that I might’ve been suicidal. The therapist asked general questions about my behavior leading up to not only seeing her but also to some of the events. I was honest with her and then she asked me if I’d ever heard of a death wish. I admitted that I hadn’t and she told me that she figured I had one.

I’m still not sure what to think. I haven’t had anymore accidents but it can be argued that I’ve simply just found a car more suited to me instead of a death wish. However, I haven’t been able to find a lot about it but if you guys have any ideas on what could’ve been happening, let me know."
t3_f03qrr,all_ads,Can magic healing/spells work for a debilitating neurological illness?,Thetruthishere,"I'm 26, f. 

since 2010 I've had onset of a progressive neurological condition. The first symptom was tinnitus that is orthostatic meaning it is both triggered by and made worse by me being upright. The other symptoms were episodes of vertigo, and severe headaches.

I have previously posted to

 https://www.inspire.com/groups/spinal-csf-leak/discussion/does-anyone-else-here-have-orthostatic-upright-position-tinnitus/?origin=freshen

and

https://www.inspire.com/groups/spinal-csf-leak/discussion/been-disabled-with-orthostatic-symptoms-for-10-years-seeking-input/?origin=freshen

I'm now experiencing cognitive decline including memory loss and dementia like episodes. I'm often sleeping for days on end without getting out of bed and my entire family is very worried about me. I also get very irritable and sensitive to sound and light at night. For the past year, my symptoms have accelerated exponentially and the orthostatic part is becoming blurred ie it now takes 8-10 hours of lying down to reduce my symptoms to 10% of what they are right before I sleep. 

I am also experiencing a build up of ''fluid'' behind my eardrum, 7/10 times I see a doctor, there is ''bubbly fluid'' behind my eardrum. 

I've been seeing ENT's and other doctors but some doctors have been very arrogant and not compassionate. The headaches and other symptoms are very negatively affecting both my physical and mental health and I am on strong medication to avoid outbursts due to my symptoms. I've previously been sent to the ER because my symptoms are making me feel mentally unstable. 

I am losing faith in doctors and feel like they do not care about me. I feel like I am stuck in a purgatory of suffering. I've been considering acupuncture therapy or magic healing (potions, spells, occult healing, etc). I have seen many stories here on Reddit that have convinced me that magic is real.

According to a few people my symptoms are consistent with a ***spinal CSF leak*** and this does get progressively worse over time as the leak sites ''open up'' more and more. If it is indeed a CSF leak, I am in the late stages and the next stage listed after ''dementia like symptoms'' is ''stupor'' and ''coma''.

I am currently disabled due to my symptoms, don't work or go out due to fatigue and lack of sleep, every day is suffering for me, I have nothing to look forward to and everything to dread, every day gets worse, and I am getting desperate."

t3_eztqet,all_ads,The floral wallpaper in my old home,Thetruthishere,"I grew up living in a small seaside neighbourhood and I lived there for about 11 years. 

What I remember about my childhood home was that it was really haunted but the room I found the most creepy was my parent’s bedroom. My dad was always away for business when I was younger so it was always my mom and I at home. 

The bedroom had a floral patterned wallpaper with weird swirls that looks like a man’s face grinning at you. I always thought maybe i was just a child with a wild imagination but I mentioned this to my mom recently and she said she always thought the wallpaper looked like faces as well. 

I’m not sensitive to anything paranormal anymore but I had a heart disease as a child and made me really weak so I was pretty sensitive to paranormal stuff. I remember I would lie on my mom’s bed for an afternoon nap and wake up slightly paralysed. The floral wallpaper faces would morph in this weird way and I would hear echoey voices of a group of people chattering away. 

My mom used to always stay in bed from severe depression. She later on told me that she felt like she couldn’t breathe when she was alone in that bedroom. She found the floral wallpaper faces really disturbing and had a similar but more severe experience like mine. 

Thank god we moved after that, my current home has really nice energy and no paranormal experiences at all."
t3_ezvh0h,all_ads,Our family ghost,Thetruthishere,"Hello all. I would like to say a few things before I get into the actual list of encounters that my family has had in my childhood home. First of all, I feel as though I should say that everything that occurred is TRUE and unexaggerated (as best I could, although feelings are involved, and when feelings are involved, it sometimes becomes difficult). Secondly, I am asking for opinions but please do your best to be respectful if you choose to comment - for better or for worse, I am a sensitive person and will probably take snippy comments to heart. 

I will try to keep this as succinct as possible, but it's not going to be a short post. Please bear with me.

My parents, me, and my two younger sisters have lived in my great-grandmother's old house since I was born. The house was built in the 1890s, and though I have done research in the town's archives, it's history, before my great-grandfather bought it in 1955, is vague. I couldn't even find information on the previous owners. My Gram is now passed away and she didn't have any information in her personal documents either. I only found one article about the house's history - in the late 1800s, just after the house was erected, a water pipe was under construction across the street. In a freak accident, the pipe apparently burst, injuring a young man. The man, who was named George, was brought to what is now my parents' house, where he unfortunately passed away before the doctor could arrive. 

This story is why my sister and I began to refer to the entity in our house as ""George"". Me, the oldest, and Rose, the youngest, are the only ones in our family who accept that the odd things that happen in our house are most likely supernatural. Our family is deeply religious, you see, and my father insists that ghosts and God are diametrically opposed. ""If there is something in the house,"" he says, ""then it's a demon masquerading as a ghost."" He'll sit us down every time we're trying to do some sleuthing or discussing a strange event, and in a very serious tone, sputter, ""You'd better not try to communicate with it, now. The Bible says that's forbidden."" So we don't try to communicate with George. But George tries to communicate with us. 

I think, even for all of his sputtering and insisting, that my father was the first to have a documented encounter with George. Years ago, before he'd met my mother and when his grandmother and grandfather still ran the house and barn as a working farm, he had stayed over to tend to the cows while his grandparents were off on an overnight trip somewhere. He had done this several times, but, as he tells it, this time, he was lying in his bed and he kept hearing a voice talking. He got up and looked around, but he couldn't figure out where it was coming from. He went back to bed when the voice seemed to shut up, but before long, it started up again, and he still had no idea if someone was in the house or not. Finally, it was quiet enough for him to fall asleep. The next day, he was out in the barn milking the cows when he heard the voice again! This time, he followed it to an old radio in the part of the barn used for storage, laughed at himself for being so worked up the previous night, and turned it off. However, the radio was broken, had not been used in a long time, and Dad doesn't remember if it was plugged in or not. 

For years my family took this story as a funny anecdote of something that happened when my father was a teenager, and laughed it off - until my now-fiancé came to have dinner with the family. My Dad told this story because my sister and I were talking about how the house was haunted, and my Dad was trying to use it to change our minds. But Aaron, my fiancé who is by no means a believer in anything, said, ""Well, if you were the only one in the house, how would the radio have turned on?"" 

Interesting. 

Every one of my family members has a story about George, even the ones who don't believe he is a ghost. My middle sister Rachael thought that I was home because she heard footsteps in the upstairs gallery, when in fact she was alone. There is a door that never closes, no matter how many times we try to shut it or fix the hinges. I have heard a distinct, short cough/clearing of the throat sound several times, at night or when I've been alone. Mom, Rachael, Rose and I have all seen a person in the corner of our eye, who then isn't there when we turn to address them. It is somewhat cliche, but at the top of the stairs to the end of the upstairs gallery there is a cold spot that comes and goes with seeming no natural reason. In what I will call the ""West Wing"" (for dramatic effect, although it's really just the westernmost side of the house), everyone has felt disturbed or uncomfortable at one point or another, just a general uneasiness. 

There is a bedroom there that we keep as a guest room, with the original furnishings of the house intact. Once I was babysitting my little cousins, one of whom is a baby of 13 months, and I was attempting to put her down for a nap in that room. The entire time, she would point at the old mirror in there and wail her head off. When I took her out of the room, she went right to sleep on the living room couch, like the perfect angel she is. 

We feel that the West Wing, which consists of the guest bedroom, the main hall staircase, the upper gallery and Rachael's bedroom, is the most haunted area of the house. We have more stories, but I will close with this one: I have a photograph of the ghost in our house. In the so-called West Wing, under the main staircase, I keep a stationary bike so that when I don't feel like going to the gym, I can still work out. One such night, I was home alone and felt like I needed a little workout, so I hopped on the bike, although I was uneasy in there from the start. As my workout progressed, I felt like someone was watching me, but I knew from past experience that if I turned around, that someone would not be there. So instead, I pulled my phone from my pocket, aimed it at the reflection of the door in an old photo that my dad had hung there, and snapped. I would have attached the photo if I could for your review - in it, as I believe one can clearly see, is a face, and that face is strangely feminine. 

Since this photo was taken, my sisters and I have begun calling the ghost ""Georgette"", instead of ""George"", but we have no idea who she is or if she is the only entity in the house. We don't feel like she is a danger, and she has never harmed us. So please let me know what you think about this. Can a house that is full of Christians be haunted? Is religion and the supernatural completely unrelated, as I tend to believe? Why is our house ghost a female when the only tragic death documented has been a male? Why the West Wing? And don't get me started on the basement, I won't even go down there because there is such a dark feeling emanating from it."
t3_ezevzp,all_ads,My little cousins strange encounter,Thetruthishere,When I was in middle school I used to spend Friday nights with my cousin. one night I jumped out of bed when I heard my little cousin crying (maybe 5 at the time) when I went to see what was wrong he told me they won't stop taking her at night. I was confused but I got him to stop crying and calm down a bit. He told me that every night the little scary looking grey people would come take his mom. I was confused but shrugged it off and got him back to sleep and did the same. The next day I told his mom what happened and apparently he did that quite often. It can probably be explained but that always scared the shit out of me.
t3_ezrcg9,all_ads,My grandparents’ weird neighbors,Thetruthishere,"Ever since we were small my cousin sister and i (we’re the same age) used to have sleepovers in my grandparents house and we had ample freedom given to us by our grandparents . Our room was pretty close to the adjacent house, so close that we could see inside their room but mostly we couldn’t because the window was closed and it was black mirror so we used to see our own reflections. We never really payed attention to it, we used to dance around, change clothes, sleep and other things. So one day we were up really late at night when we noticed someone was standing behind the window, extremely panicked yet unable to move i tried to focus, the guy who lived in the house was starting at us, ill never forget that look. Even though he saw me looking at him he didn’t bother to move.we came to realise that this wasn’t the first time he was looking at us, I don’t even want to think what else he might have seen. We didn’t tell anyone yet but stranger things started to happen in that house like their two daughters would runaround madly at 3am. His wife would stand expressionless for hours in the window. And loads of unknown people used to come and go all the time. We did tell our grandparents and parents about it but nobody seemed bothered arguing that they lived their entire life next to them and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. Its only the two of us who know that something’s very off in that family"

t3_ezgr9c,all_ads,"Hello, Reddit. I firmly believe that I am the reincarnation of Leo M Frank (d. 1915).",Thetruthishere,"I am a new member of the community, so my apologies if I have not posted this thread in the correct forum. Perhaps I am paranoid, but I like to found a good impression.

A 'fringe' subject I have been very interested in is the subject of reincarnation. I have studied it rather extensively as well as relating some traits of cases to my experiences.

I am a little skittish about directly stating who I was, given that there appears to be a cultish group who like to twist my case and use it for a preconceived agenda, but I was the second man on this list; http://www.ranker.co...ching/reference

Unfortunately, the only reason I was famous was because of how I died. I was lynched. I'm also a Jew in this life, as well. Unsurprisingly, I've been very interested in the past life experiences of others as well as how they relate to mine. I come from a fairly irreligious family who believe that we only live once, and this is one of the only places I have came across where I feel confident to discuss the subject of past lives, so do excuse me. It appears that people are still interested in this case as I came across a film about it the other night.

I'm also interested in finding any living relatives.

I am also open to any polite debates on the subject of reincarnation in itself and aforementioned related topics, such as past life regression and the findings of Dr. Ian Stevenson. It is approximately 3 'o clock in the morning at the time of writing, so excuse me for the vagueness of my post. I'll answer questions in the morning.


Ever since I was little, I looked physically different to that of my parents. I had large, prominent eyes, and an oval face. My family all have round faces by comparison. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Right so since I was real young I'd had memories of a former life. Here's the details; I'd had a wife named Lucy, and she'd usually wear a white dress. She also had black hair. I died from being hanged from a tree and during this my neck went up and I have a birthmark on the back of my neck there too. I worked at some kind of factory. It was dark bricked, was four stories tall and long. I don't get a good vibe about it I told my parents when I was 3 or 4 I didn't want to be in jail again. I didn't know what 'jail' meant. I always felt guilty for some reason, and ashamed of myself, yet, I couldn't pinpoint why.

&amp;#x200B;

 I also have this fear of going into a rage suddenly and hurting people. I looked up details since morbid curiosity got the better of me again and when I did I got an article about a murderer. What freaked me the fuck out was the eyes, since people always said my eyes look different to everyone else's in the family. Sparing the details this guy was a 30 year old serial child rapist and murderer. The child he raped was an employee of his. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just hoping to god there's another person who fits those details and wasn't the guy I just mentioned. If there is, then I'd like to know because every time I google those details, it always leads me to this monster. 

&amp;#x200B;

I vividly remember killing a girl who was either 13 or 14 and she said no but I attacked her. I remember desperately trying to pin the case on a black man. I remember being hung by a lynch mob. As a child I had memories of being hung some time in the early 20th century, for killing a girl called 'Mary'. I did PL regression and my PL name was Frank. I googled the details to see if there was a case like this and there was the Leo Frank case. My handwriting is also the same as his. I feel ashamed."
t3_ezl07v,all_ads,Witnessed a door being knocked in by nothing?,Thetruthishere,"My boyfriend at the time rented a house with two other roommates. His room was an attic converted into a nice large bedroom. A small staircase in the living room, maybe 5 steps, led up to a folding closet door where the stairs continued up to the attic. The staircase creaked loudly when walking up it and the folding door had wooden slats that let light shine through; it was also squeaky when opening and closing. Since this was the only door to his room, there was little privacy and I found it difficult to sleep when his roommates had friends over to party. So he built a door at the top of the staircase. It was a wooden door that was cut specifically to fit the space because the top needed to be cut at an angle to fully enclose the space opening to the staircase. It had a hinge and a latch to lock it on the attic side. One night we were sleeping and I was awakened by a loud knock, as if someone punched the latched door—but then it persisted about 8 more times with a second or so between each knock until the door was knocked off its hinge and fell forward into the attic. While this was happening, I patted my boyfriend’s arm to wake him up but couldn’t wake him up and then I was so scared that I hid under the blankets—which is hilarious because I’m a horror movie fan and am always like ‘c’mon do people even do that?’ A minute or so after I heard the door collapse onto the bedroom floor, I looked to see if anything was there and could now see the bedroom was slightly illuminated by the living room light coming through the folding door’s slats. Nothing was there. Nothing was in the stairway and even if there was, the stairs and folding door squeaked so loudly I would’ve surely heard it. I texted my dad to come get me, I was THAT freaked. I finally was able to wake up my boyfriend and explained what happened and wanted him to walk me downstairs to check out the house. One of the roommates’ friends was fast asleep on the couch right across from the staircase. We woke him up and he didn’t see or hear anything. This heavy wooden door was knocked down off its hinge in the middle of the night and I was the only one who witnessed it. I left and went home because I lived in the same town and came back the next morning. Everyone tried to rationalize it—maybe it was the cat? A draft of wind? They all thought it was funny especially when I asked “did anyone hear any banging last night?” -.-  Everyone was like well gee whiz, not sure what to tell ya. To this day, it’s one of the clearest examples of WTF just happened that I’ve ever experienced. I never wish that fear or isolation from others not believing/understanding you on anyone...except maybe Trump. Anyone else have a similar experience?!"
t3_ezefbq,all_ads,An Angel? Hallucination? Not sure.,Thetruthishere,"So at the age of 6 I was taken out of my mothers home and had trauma. Moved in with grandparents and the day I moved in I was walking up the stairs and saw something. It was a tall figure, glowing with a spectacular aura of gleaming gold, wearing a long draping robe with a sash and harmonizing to one pitch.  I told my grandfather what happened and he said it was an angel. However I didn’t see an ‘angel’ I don’t believe.  As i mentioned before I saw a figure with light surrounding it, draped in white clothes and a cuirass / sash going from top left shoulder to the waist and wrapping back around. Since then I’ve had multiple dreams of this exact figure. It’s appeared in different forms but the sash and the glow stay the same. Sometimes, and I say this at the risk of sounding like a loon, but often times when seeing this figure in my dreams it would be cause of deja vu later in the day / week (acting as a premonition of sorts). For example one night, at 8 years old, i saw the figure as if i was five inches away from a staticky television and then the channel changed to me at the playground talking about betting what our scores would be on the test. In the dream vision, i saw the figure again and saw our test scores and me guessing it right - following up with “i cant believe i knew it!”. I then woke up and went about doing exactly what happened in the dream and it went exactly as pictured with the same scores. it’s happened a multitude of times but less and less as i age. any ideas of what this could have been and if it has any significant meaning to my subconscious / on a different level?"
t3_ez6bgs,all_ads,Physical encounter with an entity.,Thetruthishere,"So I was 8 years old, living in the middle of a cornfield in Shelbyville, Indiana. Our closest neighbors were more than a mile away, and the closest store was a good 15 minutes drive.

 Backstory on the house: My mom was told by the landlord that her mom hung herself there in the barn outside and that she haunts the place. My mom obviously didn't believe her but she still told us to freak us out. 

Anyways I was getting ready for school one morning and sitting on my couch tying my shoes. I had the living room light on, and the kitchen light on aswell because I was scared of the dark so everything was well lit. If I look directly to my left there's a hallway that goes straight to the kitchen, and directly in line with the hallway is my kitchen sink. 

I heard some clanking to my left and look over and a fucking kitchen knife was floating towards me. In that moment it felt like my heart stopped, and I went into panic mode for a second. I screamed for my sister upstairs and as soon as her foot hit the stairs, I watched this knife do a quick 180 and shot back at the sink, stuck in the wall, and then fell in. 

I was hysterical and couldn't stop balling my eyes out. I tried to cry-explain to my sister and she never believed me, I took her over to the sink and sure enough there was a cut in the wall that lined up perfectly with that knife.

This whole experience was so vivid I can see it happening in my head as I'm writing. This was my 1st, but not last experience with paranormal entities. This is something I will never forget."
t3_eyy052,all_ads,Complete silence in the mountains,Thetruthishere,"About three years ago, I went hiking in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Since I didn't speak Arabic and my phone didn't receive data in Morocco, I decided to hire a guide. He suggested that we hike Jebel Yagour. It was a smaller mountain but I was told that it had an excellent view. About a quarter of the journey up the mountain, I suddenly couldn't hear anything. I thought I was about to pass out and I sat down quickly. 

As I sat there, I realized I wasn't lightheaded. My vision was perfectly fine and I began to stand back up. I took a step forward, but I couldn't hear my foot hit the rocky ground beneath it. I took another step forward and then I once again could hear everything. I could hear my guide call out to me and ask if I was okay. I could hear the wind again and I could hear the voices of other people further up the mountain. I turned around and stepped back where I was standing a moment prior and again I heard nothing. I slammed my foot into the ground trying to make a sound but I still heard nothing. I picked up a small rock and threw it downward but still nothing. I eventually stepped forward again and called for my guide to come to me. 

I asked him to stand where I was a moment ago. He looked at me weird but he stood there and I saw his eyes get wide. He took two steps forward very quickly and asked what just happened. I told him I hoped he'd know but he had no idea. He seemed really spooked, even more so than me, and suggested we keep hiking. On the way up the mountain, we talked about how weird our experience was and I decided to try to find the same spot on the way down. Once we reached the top and hiked back down, I tried standing in the same spot as earlier. The problem was that the spot looked like every other part of the mountain surrounding it. I spent about 30 minutes looking for the spot but I couldn't find it. I know it's a long shot but has anyone ever experienced something similar? Even better, has anyone experienced this on Jebel Yagour?"
t3_ezh3s3,all_ads,The woman with the flowers,Thetruthishere,"The woman with the flowers

I was driving with 3 friends of mine late at night. The highway was closed for construction, so we had to take small side streets that were basically dirt roads without streetlights to guide us. As we drove using the headlights from the car, I saw a woman up on the right kneeling down in the grass. She had long black hair, a white dress, and held blue and red flowers in her hand. As we got closer, it turned out to be a white cross with flowers sitting at the bottom. We continued to drive and I thought nothing of it. I thought perhaps I was tired and my eyes didn’t see it right. 30 seconds pass and one of my friends speaks up “Did anyone see that woman?” My heart skips a beat and I reply, “With the black hair?” My other friend chimes in, “And the white dress?” And my last friend finishes it with, “She was holding flowers, right?!” We all were silent for a few moments and then changed the subject. To this day I can’t logically explain that away.

t3_eyzoto,all_ads,Non-sleep paralysis experience,Thetruthishere,"I'd like to share this experience and read some of your thoughts and opinions on this.

Since I was a kid, I occasionally had feeling that something is in the room with me, that something is watching me and wants to hurt me. I'm sure everyone who had sleep paralysis or seen shadow people knows the feeling. The only problem is, it wasn't when I was sleeping or just woke up. It was always when fully awake, usually at night and when laying on the bed but occasionally even during the day when walking around.

I always had a theory that these things feed on your fear, if you don't fear them they aren't attracted to you. Yes, I know that many people believe that science fully explains sleep paralysis and this is just hallucinations etc. I'm not one of those people. Ok I'll get to the point.

When I was around 18 (Im in 20s now), I tried a thing called Gates of hades - I-doser (binaural beat program - different songs are supposed to induce specific state of mind). It was supposed to scare you. A tutorial somewhere said to lie down and put a cloth or something over your eyes to make it work. It's 30 min long, after about 25 minutes I realized my body is paralyzed and I felt the evil presence in my room with me again, this time it was really powerful and I had a strong feeling that it was going to kill me and I thought I was going to die. 

I did not fall asleep, I was fully conscious and I managed to turn off the song after few minutes. I did not actually see anything because of the cloth over my eyes, yeah, probably disappointing to you guys. 

I thought it was the song (gates of hades) at the time but I tried it few times later (I'm too curious not to) and it never worked again. The ""official"" opinion is that it is a placebo. Maybe, maybe not. 

Since then, I've had sleep paralysis often but I never saw anything, never felt even a little scared and had no hallucinations or fear at all. It's been probably like 7+ years.

My question is, how could I have sleep paralysis-like experiences while being totally awake. The science fails to explain this. Other times I mentioned there was no way I could have fallen asleep without knowing as I was walking, even running and doing things.

About 15 years ago I snapped a picture on a cell phone i think it was a Razor flip phone pretty low quality pic, and there was what appeared to be a frog like creature sitting on my friends shoulder. It looked like a frog same body position legs out to the side like a frog. Similar to a gargoyle.

We were A bunch of young girls of course were all screaming shrieking my friend who was in the pic started crying horrified she went and locked her self in the bathroom wouldn't come out till we stopped “making fun of her”. She insisted I delete the pic and so I did. Needless to say we weren’t exactly making fun of her we were just absolutely shocked at what we were seeing! 

I thought of every possible explanation but there was nothing behind her she was against a plain wall and it wasn’t her hair her hair was completely pulled to the other side just this ugly random thing just chilling on her shoulder. The things mouth was wide open too.

Maybe was a phone glitch that imposed it on there, it wasn’t a shadow it was way too detailed it wasn’t abstract it was like a proper looking creature. Like you didn’t have to squint to see it I literally screamed when I first saw the picture each girl I passed it to screamed without me even saying what I had seen. 
It wasn’t one of those see what I see in that cloud... ummm kinda... type moments. 
 

Anyone have any cool stories? I would love to hear them. Even if you don’t have the picture that’s OK."
t3_eysgvb,all_ads,Spiritual entity visiting / healing during meditation,Thetruthishere,"This is a throwaway account because this is weird af, but hopefully someone can give their insight, or perhaps it will help someone in some way.

Background info:

Im male, 27. In May 2019 I had what I call a spiritual awakening through meditation alone. I saw the synchronicity in everything, became very spiritual and philosophical, had 'the knowing', and thought I was from the christ soul group. Kept running into people who I thought had 'the knowing', and we would disagree on nothing. I thought we were some sort of 'gods', but at the same time felt like they were all better people than myself. I felt like I finally understood that we are beings of light, and everything is made up of light.

The only downside was that I wasn't sleeping at all! This worried my family the most, which lead to them taking me to the hospital who sent me to the psych ward. I spent 2 weeks in one psych ward, spent 3 days on the outside, then another 2 weeks in another psych ward. I was given all sorts of antipsychotics until I was finally a vegetable. The psychiatrist saw my silence as great improvement!

Taking antipsychotics was the worst mistake of my life. I stopped in august, and it took me a long time to start feeling normal again. And I promised myself I would never take them again. I would rather be dead or crazy. Silent, emotionless, existing but not living. 

Fast forward to last thursday. 

I started meditating again because I thought it may help speed up the healing process. About 20 minutes into it and I can feel this presence hovering around my head. With my eyes closed I could see an orbital form, and this entity has some sort of gravitational push or pull.

This was my first contact ever with a spiritual entity. I started trying to ask it questions like what's their name, where are they from, why are you here, etc. But I wasn't really getting any responses mentally. I suppose my visual and auditory psych centers aren't very strong. I could just feel them. I asked if they were male or female, and then I felt this very powerful female energy. I made me chuckle a bit for some reason. Later on a thought came through that said ""60% chance you will die"". I opened my eyes wide a grasped the couch behind me with my hands. Heart was racing. Then another thought came ""calm down"". So another hour goes by and I guess they were trying to gain my trust in this tine by sending me love vibrations and peaceful energy. It felt amazing, but then she tried to enter my stomach and it was pinching a little. I told her to stop and she wouldn't. Fear took over and I jumped out my seat and ran upstairs to my bedroom. 

I was hoping she would stay put, but she followed me all the way to my room! She kept trying to stop me from moving by throwing her energy to my feet. It didn't hurt, it just felt strange like there was extra gravity pulling me down. So I make it to my room and my son is sleeping in my bed. I grab the covers and put them over my head and cover my son too. The entity didn't care about any of that. It kept zapping my body and making it shake, and even made my son's legs and arms shake. Then it starts touching me sexually for a little while. After I calm down it starts trying to enter my stomach again. So I roll over on top of my stomach and went to sleep. 

The next morning I sent my son off to school and went to go meditate again. Sure enough the entity returns, gains my trust through feelings again, and then tries to enter my stomach. This time I let it. It crawls around my stomach for 15 minutes or so before it comes around. My stomach is making weird noises.

I think it cleared some sort of blockage because I was shitting like crazy for the next 3 days. Perhaps this had to do with the ""60% chance you die"" thing?

Meditated later that day, nothing. Meditated Saturday and Sunday, nothing. On Monday night (yesterday) I meditate and a entity shows up again. Can't say if it's the same one or not since I can't really talk to it. It starts poking around in my head for 6 hours. From 10pm to 4am. Prodding and zapping, making my arms or legs move randomly, and giving me all sorts of strange sensations inside my head. It didn't hurt or feel good. It allowed me to have a bathroom, water, and even a vape break during this time. If I started feeling fear, it would send love energy to me to calm me down. Halfway through it had me lay down. 

This has been the strangest phenomena I've ever encountered. I think a spiritual entity performed brain surgery on me last night. LOL. I'll update if more happens. 
If someone has any tips on how to communicate effectively with them, then please let me know!"
t3_eyjmqg,all_ads,My experience on the other side pt.2,Thetruthishere,"Link to pt. 1  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/equcii/my\_experience\_on\_the\_other\_side/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/equcii/my_experience_on_the_other_side/) 

&amp;#x200B;

After my experience in December I had found that my mental state no longer aligned with the ethics of my profession. I was an Infantryman, closing within and destroying the enemy in close combat was something we all strove for. To understand this story a little background on myself is necessary. 

When I first joined the Army, my motivation for combat came from a place of anger, confusion, and personal turmoil. My father raised me with violence, but I allowed his actions to affect and define my character. From 13 I begun to self-medicate, with anything I could find. From weed and alcohol to pills, mdma, and psychedelics. My junior year of high-school I voluntarily withdrew to attend rehab for an extended Xanax habit.  I spent my 17th birthday in a rehab facility in east Texas.  At 19 I graduated and joined the Airborne Infantry, I believed I had found my true calling and an outlet for my aggression. 

Unfortunately for me at the time, going to war is not a decision made by young privates. After a year of a training my brigade was placed on GRF (global response force), which was at the time, a yearlong sentence to garrison life. I had found no glory or bloodshed, Instead boredom and bureaucracy. 

I expected war, and I received weekend staff duties and tactical laser tag. So, I turned to an old enjoyment of mine, drugs. Due to persistent drug tests in the military I stayed away from most narcotics. LSD and mushrooms became my drugs of choice, considering psychedelics are not tested for with normal drug tests. I began to push the limits of reality further and further. I loved raving, taking high doses of acid and dancing my ass off to EDM became a consistent hobby of mine. Eventually we were slotted for a deployment, we were going to Kandahar. Finally, my goal was in sight. Although our deployment was still about 9 months away. Fuck that, no reason to stop taking psychedelics, it was enjoyable and an excellent way to pass the time. Even with the extensive use of psychedelics I still retained my jaded mentality. My psychedelic usage culminated in December of 2016, when my consciousness disconnected from my physical form and was pulled back into a transcendental state in which I was given a glimpse into the world beyond.    

After returning from the other side, I found my headspace to be completely different.  The newly found empathy and love gave me a positive purpose and direction. I was amazed at the information I had been blessed with. I witnessed firsthand that there was something beyond this life, although more than seeing it, I had FELT it. It was the deepest self-reflection I had ever experienced, and after, I found I no longer had the gall to take human life. And here laid my moral dilemma. 

Our deployment to Kandahar was slotted for the summer of 2017. I was a team leader, an assistant gunner to be exact. I oversaw a machine gun team, which is a crucial part of the infantry platoon. The responsibility of my position weighed on me. 

Although I knew everything about the war was wrong. It used to have never bothered me, for I didn’t care about the military industrial complex profiting off the war. In my old mindset I only cared about satisfying my desires for violence. After my experience, I couldn’t even fathom killing another human. For I knew it is inherently wrong. 

Honestly though it was embarrassment that made me decide to revert to my old ways. I killed the good that was fostered inside of me, out of the fear of embarrassment. As Tim O’Brian said in *The Things They Carry*, “I would go to the war—I would kill and maybe die— because I was embarrassed not to.” 

I now empathize with Mr. O’Brian. For I too was a coward; I knew it was wrong and I decided to go to war. (O’Brian, TTTC, pg. 57,58) 

Changing my mindset wasn’t difficult. If you understand that the universe is mental, and that thoughts control our world, nothing is impossible. Not using psychedelics anymore was also useful in reverting my ways of thought. 

Now, this is where the story really begins. It was early June 2017, I was on pre-deployment leave in my hometown of Santa Monica, CA. My parents were living in Italy at the time, so I had decided to spend my leave in California with my aunt and my friends. 

My aunt owned a successful escrow business in Santa Monica, she lived in a beautiful condo at the corner of Ocean and California, overlooking the pacific. She spoiled the fuck out of me while I was there considering I was about to deploy. 

I had been on leave for at least a week when the incident occurred. I was watching T.V. with my aunt while having a glass of Dom Perignon (she bought that shit like water). I had exactly one glass, and that was it. My aunt was tired, and she went to bed. Even thought I was tired, and I had a bedroom to sleep in, I remained on the couch. I felt incredibly comfortable on the couch, so I decided to just lie on my back and slip into slumber. I fell asleep almost instantaneously. 

What woke me was unexpected. My arm had fallen off the open side of the couch. And I felt something licking it. Like a small dog. My aunt had a cat, but the licking was incessant and didn’t feel like the rough tongue of a feline. I rose from the couch to view it. 

It was a small dog, it looked akin to a miniature schnauzer. Except for one defining feature.

It had no skin. 

The creature hurried away as I rose from the couch. After standing up I had noticed, that my blanket was still on the couch and had not fallen off when I stood up. But the blanket looked larger than I remembered, more puffed up like there was a mass of something under it. 

It finally registered, the mass was me, I was under the blanket. 

That moment I realized I was separated from my body; although my attention was drawn by something across the room. It was the skinned dog hurrying into the dining room. I followed it. 

When I reached the dining room, I immediately noticed her. 

At first, she was standing. she stood at about 5’7 was lanky, with long white hair, and endless wrinkles going down her grey skin. She crouched down behind the table when she saw me. She looked like a Hagraven from Skyrim. 

As creepy as this all might sound, fear was not my first instinct. After my experience in December, I was more interested than afraid. I had done research about spirits and entities since then, and I was fully aware that I was responsible for letting them affect me. My thoughts and energy kept me safe and as approached the woman. I walked to the same side of the table as her. She scuttled away into the corner of the room as I approached. 

I chuckled and was pretentiously impressed at the strength of my astral form. I was ready to test my limits. Remembering my research on lucid dreaming, I wanted to attempt to create things in my astral form. I could have tried a million different things. I could have tried flying around Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.

But no, I was still fucked in the head. I decided to create two humans. And a pistol, so I could kill them. I was psyched up for deployment. All I wanted to do was get my first kill. So why not do a test run? All it took was the thought. I thought it and it transpired. I created two men dressed in suits. And a Glock 19 in my hand. I fired two rounds into each man, center mass. 

Immediately my vision went white. Blindingly so. Like a flashbang in Call of Duty. I heard a voice, a loud but calm and familiar voice. All it said was “You can’t kill people in lucid dreams!” “You’re not supposed to do it!”

Instantly I snapped back into my body. It was 7:30 am, the sun was up, and my aunt was cooking breakfast. I walked into the kitchen and saw her cooking something. I was famished, and happy to finally be awake from my lucid dream. She asked me if Id like breakfast. I attempted to respond. 

I couldn’t speak. 

She asked again. 

I tried again, no change. 

I put my hand to my mouth only to realize that I HAD NO MOUTH. I started to violently shake and vibrate my vocal cords in an intense muffled scream. 

And then I awoke, for real this time. I was back on the couch, it was dark. I sat up and looked at the clock on the DVR. 

It was 3:33 AM. The hour of the devil.

I understood the significance of the time and returned to sleep hastily. I left Los Angeles a week later. 

I went to Afghanistan in late June. I saw combat, but I never killed anyone. (but not for the lack of trying) I returned in 2018, and with a year left on my contract I began to prepare for my new life. I resumed using psychedelics, but in a more responsible manner. My introspective trips re kindled my positive mindset. More importantly though I found love. I met her in the summer of 2018, now we are married. I am now pursing a degree in philosophy, with the goal of spreading the truth of my message; We are more than corporal mass, we are eternal beings. This reality is medium for our spirit to learn and grow."
t3_eyrkzh,all_ads,A flash I could feel,Thetruthishere,"My brother and I were driving home from a friends house at around 11:00pm. We’re driving in my Jeep when we both felt and saw a white flash that surrounded everything and made it so we couldn’t see for about 3 seconds. I didn’t think of it really. I knew it was odd, neither of us said anything for near a minute after. My brother turned to me and said, “you felt that right”.  We both explained what we felt and saw. The part besides a flash that was all around and seemingly out of nowhere that was weird is, that you could feel a weight and warmth on every part of your body. We both felt it and explained similar feelings as to what occurred. I woulda brushed it off as nothing. Maybe just being tired but my brother waiting a minute in silence then turning to explain the same feeling is what made me think it was something different or unnatural. My brother as someone who is straight forward and not to believe in UFOs or things of that nature. it was something out of body or out of world has made me ponder those three seconds for years."

t3_eyjlwg,all_ads,"Pre-2008, unmarked, dark colored blimp with red lights over NJ",Thetruthishere,"I'm not sure of the exact time frame, because it's been so long that I can't remember whether it happened during my childhood in NJ or during the year I lived there after college. At any rate, it was definitely before 2008. I posted this and then deleted it because I wanted to make sure this sub was for real life encounters and that I was abiding by sub rules.

My parents and I were driving home through a suburban NJ town late one night when we happened to look up and notice a large, unmarked, dark colored (possibly black or dark grey) blimp like object crossing low and slow overhead. I don't recall it having any other color lights but red, though I do remember thinking that it seemed like the other cars in the area noticed it as well because it seemed like traffic slowed down as it passed.

My memories of that sighting are so vague now- neither of my parents remember it happening at all- so I can't craft a particularly thrilling retelling of it at this point. I did look up UFO sightings in the news the next morning, but I think because it was before the days of the 24 hr internet news cycle, there really wasn't anything to find. Every few years I'll google a description of the blimp and the area I think we saw it in, but absolutely nothing comes up.

ETA: When I met my husband and we started dating, I found out that he knew about aircraft and the like, so I specifically asked him about anything matching what I saw that night and he said it didn't sound familiar. He thought it was probably a Goodyear blimp but it was definitely not that"

t3_eycy7k,all_ads,Strange lights in the sky,Thetruthishere,"This will sound like a classic UFO story, with the only exception that it is not set in the US lol. But it happened to me and my family and I wanted to share it with you guys.

So we were in holiday in the south of our country (Italy) and we had rented a holiday house in the middle of a field of olive trees. Just towards the horizon, right after the foliage, you could see the sea. Pretty suggestive sight not gonna lie.

We were just chilling on the balcony right before dusk when my sister said something like ""yo there are some magic ass lights floating in the sky"" (couldn't really translate the italian in a more similar way, I'm sorry), so I was like no shit and went to see, thinking ""maybe she confused those lights with some stars or something"", but when I checked I spotted these fucking lights going in a straight line from about the sea line to the middle sky and stopped for a few moments. I called my parents and they arrived as well. The magic lights were set in a pentagonish formation. After a few seconds these damn things just take off going a million km/h to the right and disappear. I was like well now I got a story to tell. 

Except I didn't do it and remembered about it just now. In that moment we just looked at ourselves with mouth and eyes wide open and then laughed, trying to think about some rational explanation, but then I guess we just kinda dropped it and went on with our holiday and life. Today my mum just came with this episode out of the blue during a family dinner and I was blown away by my own memory.

So there's that. Nothing special, but I guess I just wanted to tell this story to anyone who was not part of my family."
t3_exs8fa,all_ads,Floating experience?,Thetruthishere,"Ok so i just remembered something from my early childhood where i was 5-7 years old
I would lay down onto the floor and get into this super relaxed state of mind etc, until i felt like I was floating over the floor (literally floating!) 
I would float until i moved/ opened my eyes or just get distracted by something
I did that pretty often, but now I can‘t anymore since i don‘t know how to do that or what that even was.

Does anyone know what this experience is called?"
t3_exlcwd,all_ads,A child that I saw on the bridge,Thetruthishere,"I live in the Philippines so walking great distances isn't really a big surprise especially with all the traffic that this country has to offer.

It was around 11:30pm and I decided to go to the nearest 7-11 in my town because my cousin wouldn't shut up about wanting to get a tub of ice cream before watching Netflix together.

It wasn't that far, but I need to walk over a bridge to get there and that particular bridge had over a dozen of haunting paranormal stories.

The bridge was just old wooden planks nailed together and it's slightly dangerous because it's old, moldy and just over a meter in width.

Of course, there was no one outside anymore because the people here believed that there was a ghost who pushes anyone who tries to cross the bridge after 10pm towards the lake at the bottom.

But I wasn't that much superstitious so I just walked over to that bridge.

The creepy thing is, the bridge had this sharp turning corner to give way to a house and the hauntings are said to usually occur in that spot.

I was chatting with my cousin on my phone but I stopped when I was about to step on the bridge.

I looked up and I swear I almost screamed loudly.

I saw this small child not far away from me, standing on the exact turning corner of the bridge.

She was wearing a white dress, had long black hair and pitch black eyes.

I had my glasses on and it was a full moon, so I was more than sure that the white part in her eyes were missing. There were just two black voids.

The child started to walk towards me, so I ran back towards the direction that I came from.

When I looked behind me, she was gone.

I just returned home that night and told my cousin what happened.

She too was scared because three of our childhood friends experienced being pushed over that bridge long ago. She thinks that that child is the one at fault.

What do you guys think? Have you guys ever experienced anything like this?

t3_exqyv7,all_ads,A Strange Experience in an Abandoned Metro Tunnel,Thetruthishere," This may be the strangest and most terrifying thing I have experienced while doing urban exploration. 

We (There were two of us) were in the abandoned metro of Rochester, New York, filming a documentary on it. At one point, we heard a voice echoing through the concrete corridor. At first it sounded like a woman calling for a friend, but what she was saying was unintelligible. We assumed she was calling out for a friend, so we kept walking. Heard nothing for a few seconds but then it started up again. This time it sounded closer and stranger. Still nonsense, but no longer like she was calling for a friend- more like she was yelling at someone. Us, maybe. Then a light appeared from one of the pillars. As soon as we turned off ours, the light was gone. There was no voice after that, and no light, or sound at all. No sound of someone running or walking away or anything. We didn't think much of it at the time, but things get stranger while I was editing the video. 

So the light appeared relatively close to us, maybe 100 or 150 meters away. This was close to an open manhole cover that led into an old brick sewer that we found. It looked like it was recently open, and although we didn't entertain the notion at the time, this woman may have gone down their after we spooked her. 

It is also possible that she hid and waited for us to leave, or was following us. I had a feeling we were being watched and kept checking behind me the whole time we were down there. That doesn't prove that she was following us, but it is certainly odd. I have been to abandoned hospitals and high schools and rarely have I had this feeling. 

After the documentary was uploaded a few people I know tried to decipher what she was saying but it sounded like nonsense. I don't think this was anything paranormal, but the whole thing was just weird. Like, if it was just a squatter or homeless person we would know. We would have heard them running or hiding or they would have tried to scare us away or something. 

A very odd experience. Does anyone have any idea what this could have been?"
t3_exilmp,all_ads,My Dead Dog accepted us getting a new one (+more stories),Thetruthishere,"Backstory: My Dog, Baxter, recently passed away from stomach cancer. The vet told my family he was going to live another 3 months, but passed away a few days later (November 3rd to be exact). He was a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, and was 13.

I remember laying in bed crying. He used to lay beside me and protect me. I trusted him to keep watch, which he did, and I would hug him if I heard a noise. When I was laying on the left side of the bed, I had a vision of him laying on the bed. He was black and white, and glowing. He looked peaceful as he lay.

After his death, I’ve had a couple dreams of him, which I thought was significant.

Story 1: It was a beautiful day outside, and I was with my mom, who was washing the dishes and looking outside. That’s when I peer through the window and noticed a brown figure dash across the grass “BAXTER!” I thought. I ran downstairs and opened the door. Low and behold, he dashes right through the door. He scurries up the steps and started running around, as if he was glad to see my mom (Who he was very attached too, before he passed away). I looked at my mom “Mom! Look! He’s back!” She didn’t notice him or acknowledged his presence. She just looked out the window. I realized that he was a ghost, as though, he hijacked my dream. He played around for a second, played some quick fetch and then, he disappeared.

Context for Story 2: 
Me and my family are expecting a puppy this may, and so I was worried that if baxter were alive today, would he approve of my family getting a dog?

Story 2:

It was one of those dreams at the end, where it was celebratory, like ending and nightmare or story of a dream. The party was on, and I look at a rock, and notice Baxter sitting upon it, looking down, his mouth in the smiling position, and he was panting a little bit. I walk up to him, and then look down at my side, and I see the specific dog breed my family was going to buy. I look up at Baxter, and he is still smiling. I thought he would be upset that we were replacing him, but he looked happy. I knew, he was trying to say that he accepts my family of getting a new dog. I put my hand on his fur, and strangely, It had the same fluffy texture he had before he died. It looked like it was glowing, I rubbed his fur, remembering what it felt like, before I put my hand on his face, and waking up from my dream. 

Keep in mind, these were dreams, so I might have just made it up in my mind in my dream, but all felt real.

Anyway, thanks y’all, love this subreddit, hope to write soon!"
t3_exlu3x,all_ads,Odd voices on a hike,Thetruthishere,"This happened a few years ago, but I was reminded of it today after watching a hiking vlog.
I was on the return leg of an overnight hike, on a rough track cut through thick scrubby forest. It was a warm, sunny afternoon with no wind, and I was almost drowsy.
There was the sound of children's voices ahead, a bit too far away to be distinct. I thought this was odd, as it was a couple hours walk from the road-end and they sounded fairly young.
It was the usual sort of fitful kid's conversation, and although it got louder as I got closer, I still couldn't quite distinguish the words. The talking died down and ended completely when I was almost on top of them.
There I got a shock. Where I thought the children were was not the track. It was a steep, thickly wooded gully, with a trickle of water at the bottom just visible through the scrub. This was terrain I would go well out of my way to avoid. I was confused because the children hadn't sounded panic stricken and surely they'd never go down there intentionally. 
I called out and pushed in a way, but there was no response. I lost a bit of skin looking around, and eventually guiltily gave up the search. 
Monitored the news sites for any mention of lost children when I got home, but there was nothing. Not much more to tell. Did an internet search for kids lost there in the past, but it was in the backblocks and there wasn't much information about the area at all."
t3_exjguy,all_ads,I was stalked,Thetruthishere,"Hey all, I have quite a story to tell. Believe or don’t, this is my story.

Some backstory, Me and a friend were involved in the occult. I was just interested in learning of it, he was interested in acting in it, we’ll call him Matt. 

I’ve left a comment about Matt here before, but I’ll repeat it, summarized... Mainly because only about three people actually read that. Matt and I played a game about making bets with an entity, if you win you win whatever you made a bet for, if you lose, the entity wins the exact opposite, I.E. If you bet for love, and you lose, you’ll find yourself alone. If you win the the entity will help you find love.

You played this game with a two cups and two die, one on either side of any board game board, we used a life board. You put a die with the cup sitting straight up, you make your “bet” or “deal” or “negotiation” I don’t know what to call it, you basically make a wish, and call upon the entity to play you. Then you flip your cup and walk out of the pitch dark room. Once you call upon the entity if everything is set up correctly, you’ll know it’s there. You’ll feel it’s presence. A kind of feeling that fills you with awe and dread, makes you want to not turn your back but on it but run in the opposite direction. You’ll wait a few minutes and it’ll play it’s turn. You WILL hear the die in the cup flip, no matter where you are in the house. That’s how you know it’s played. You go back in the room and if your roll is higher than the entities roll, you win and vise versa. If you are done playing, and no one else wants to play, you salt and destroy the die or ensure no one will ever find it again. You cannot play this game twice in a row, only once a week, but multiple people can play, making their own wishes. (One by one of course). This entity is Game Master of sorts, and it doesn’t back down from a good game of chance. Just be respectful and it’ll be fair.

Matt had lost some fairly expensive jewelry and wanted to bet those, he lost his bet, meaning the entity would ensure he would never find them again. Who knows, maybe he’s all pimped out with those rings right now. Matt was pretty upset and asked me to play and ask for the same thing. I read over the rules and didn’t see anything that said not to that and went ahead and reset the board. As soon as I called upon the entity to play, after making the bet, I could feel it. It was there and it was mad. I knew it was angry and I fled the room room, it wanted to hurt me.

Not even a minute later I heard it play. We went back in and the entities die was missing. The rules we found online even said “Warning: if you cannot find the entities die after play, God help you.”

I was scared shitless, not to mention so more spooky stuff happened but that besides the point. Either way we pissed this thing off by double dipping a bet.

So fast forward two weeks, back at Matt’s house. There’s more of us this time, Me, Matt, John, and Chris. (Names changed for obvious reasons) and Matt had been telling us something is in his woods, he told us he doesn’t like to sit outside on his patio past dark because it whispers stuff to him. 

He told us this at one in the morning. All of us being dumb teenagers decided to go off into the woods with only two flashlights, me and John carrying them. I went in last and Matt was leading because he knew of a clearing. The first thing I noticed was how dark it was around us. Trees blotted out the moon and the stars leaving only our flashlights as light.

So we walked about a quarter mile in and found the clearing, all while, every now and then we would hear voices. Little unintelligible voices.

As soon as we reached the clearing, mind you it was still surrounded by forest and not big enough for there to be any light seepage, we heard rustling to our left, somewhere where our light was not. Me and John beamed these big ass semi-spotlights to that area, there was nothing. We heard fast movement behind us, running to us. It sounded like a dog but it was much too heavy. Me and John shined our lights there... There was nothing. At this point we realized, Matt was right. The voices intensified, we all heard them. The things they told me to do was sickening. It was like my own voice but it was an intrusion. I didn’t think it on my own will. It was like hearing a whisper in my own head from my own voice. 

They said stuff like “Bash Matt over the head with the flashlight” and “Go back, check Matt’s closet. Shoot everyone in the house.” Demented stuff like that. The one that still scares me to this day is when I heard “Pour gasoline all over yourself and set yourself on fire” for reasons I’ll get to. That is the first time I’ve ever written down some of the things the voices told me to do. I’m not crazy, I’ve never had a history of schizophrenia, I went into those woods sober as the day I was born. 

I looked at Matt, then John, then Chris. I knew we all heard the evil demands. We had all backed into a circle, me and John covering 180 degrees, however wherever the light was not, the sounds would come from. Grunting, footsteps, scream, but every time we shined our lights from the source, there would be nothing.

Needless to say we ran. We ran so fast. Back the way we came, we didn’t even stay on the make shift trail we ripped through brambles and dodged trees. I exited first, then Chris did, then John. We all caught our breathes at the end of the woods before we noticed Matt was standing still, in the woods. I remember distinctly yelling at Matt to hurry up and get the fuck out of the woods. He looked at me, tears pouring from his eyes and just said no. Me and John weren’t having that so we grabbed him, mind you he tried to run further in. 

We pulled him out and down he went, like a bag of rocks onto the earth. He was out cold. He begun seizing. After he finished his seizure we picked him up and carried him back to his room, terrified. He started walking around again around 4am, we were all still up and scared shitless. Matt had not ever had a seizure before this.

We all went home and agreed not to tell anyone of this. About three to four weeks after this Matt was sent to a psych ward. didn’t get out until a few months had passed. He wasn’t ever the same.

Matt killed himself in those woods, the same way the thing told me to kill myself. Lighting myself on fire. He was only recognized because he wore his class ring when he did the act. 

Without a doubt in my mind, I know we fucked up playing that game. I regret it daily but at the same time I’m somewhat thankful the entity knew I wasn’t to blame. I had a few weird experiences after that game, but nothing that tormented me like the things Matt had told me about. Maybe I’ll write about those sometime. 

As for John and Chris, I still talk to Chris, he’s a good guy. John turned out to be a snake, who did his best to ruin my reputation in one year, we don’t talk. 

Anyway this is my story. Believe it or not, idrc just wanted to share with you guys.

EDIT: I forgot to mention the god-forsaken smell that loomed over us choking our breathes in our lungs. I’ve smelled a squirrel that had died in my shed and had been decaying for weeks, I know what that is but it was worse than that. A combination of putrid smells that made me gag. As if 100 pigs had died in pile of their own shit in a especially hot summer day and were bloated beyond recognition as a pig, there was a touch as if someone pelted the pigs with egg and left that there to cook in the summer’s son. But beyond the absolute putridness of that there was the smell of a campfire. You know when you’ve sat next to a fire for a while and your very skin begins to smell of that flames? Well add that to the mix and yet *still* it’s missing a special ingredient that made it all the much more worse. There was a smell of blood, an iron smell and that I often smell after a nose bleed, and wait there’s more, sweat. There was a part that smelled like body oder of a man who ran 10 miles and didn’t shower for a week added to the mix. That is what I can best describe this foul smell as."
t3_ex6xwb,all_ads,A friendly spirit visited me tonight,Thetruthishere,"So every Saturday night, I visit my aunt and uncle for dinner and a movie. One of my favourite things about visiting is seeing their dogs. They have three dogs: a pug named Silas, a groodle named Layla and a golden retriever named Doug. They’ve had Silas for 17 years, whereas Layla is 7 and Doug is 4, so obviously they’re a lot more energetic. Layla and Doug tend to jump on me as soon as I enter the house, whereas Silas just kind of paces the room. In the last year or so, he’s developed a degenerative nerve disorder. You can no longer pet him because if you touch his spine, he’ll collapse. He’s not in a good way. He’s incontinent and almost blind. Sometimes he falls over and can’t get up. Other times he walks into things and gets his head stuck in them. He looks like a little old man and behaves like one too.

So tonight I arrive and I say hello to all the dogs. Silas, Layla and Doug are all standing in the doorway. Silas is just wandering around, minding his own business, while Layla and Doug are running around because they’re excited to see the lady who comes around once a week to give them cuddles and pats and treats. I don’t hear Silas’s paws click-clacking against the hardwood floors when he walks around the room like I usually do but I don’t think much of it. It’s only around dinner time that I make an offhand comment about not having seen him since I arrived.

It’s then that my uncle tells me they had him put down last week.

I know I’m not crazy. I know what I saw. That dog was there to greet me. I think he just wanted to say hello one more time before he went to heaven."
t3_exlbbk,all_ads,350mph in a car,Thetruthishere,"Hello, first time poster here. 
I wanted to share a short story from maybe 4 years ago. Me and Friend A drove about 300km (~186 miles) to visit Friend B, which took us roughly 2-3 hours. It was a  spontaneous visit and we left Friend B‘s house at 11:40 pm. By 12:20 am we could see the skyline of our city. We encountered not one single normal car on the Autobahn/Highway, but hundreds of heavy trucks with cargo. I watched the speedometer for like 20 minutes and we never broke 200kmh (124mph) We essentially drove the 300km back to our city in roughly 40 min which puts us at what i believe to be around 350mph. In an old Ford Family Car with a 20kg Buddha statue on the backseat. Friend A also recalls this story and has no explanation for it. I still dont know what happened that night. What do you think happend? Any logical explanations out there?"
t3_exv72a,all_ads,According to Wikipedia there are dinosaurs still alive somewhere,Thetruthishere,"I came across a wiki article on dinosaurs because a friend wanted me to paint a velociraptor and i looked at the temporal range tab and to my surprise it said ''233 mya - 0 mya''!

so they're apparently alive out there somewhere, I have yet to see one in person though, and dinosaurs appeared to have vanished from the fossil record after the infamous asteroid impact so I'm kind of conflicted on what to believe."
t3_ex0l32,all_ads,One of many unexplained experiences in my childhood home,Thetruthishere,"This is an experience that seems unbelievable even years later. I was probably 13, so like 7 years ago, in the home I grew up in, which always had a feel that something was there. My parents and siblings all had weird experiences. Electronic toys would often go off in the middle of the night, and I even snapped a selfie with an unmistakeable and completely unexplainable face in the background. 

This happened one morning when I woke up to go to school. My alarm went off at 7:00, and I went to the bathroom like usual. I sat down to pee, and I suddenly heard an alarm. It was similar to the National Weather Alert system alarm in that it was loud and jarring, a frequency made to be heard from far away. This alarm went off 3 times, and a female voice said “Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there?” It was almost automated, but too lively human. I FROZE. It’s important to note than 3 other people and a dog lived there too, who surely would’ve freaked out and barked if she heard any sort of noise before anybody was up. My sister’s room was adjacent to the bathroom, she’s a light sleeper, and the alarm and voice were LOUD. I didn’t move a muscle as minutes passed. Then, again. Alarm, alarm, alarm, “Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there?” I was going through what could possible be happening in my mind and couldn’t find anything. An alien abduction? Did humans go extinct and they’re looking for survivors? I was just staring blankly ahead and did not lift a finger. At around 7:20, my sister got up. She knocked on the door and asked if everything was alright. I told her what happened, and she said she didn’t hear a thing. My mom was asleep for a while longer after this too. So like... wtf? Most bizarre experience of my life... any thoughts? Or maybe even a similar experience? Xx"
t3_ex9h88,all_ads,Little Brother Used To See Ghosts,Thetruthishere,"I always found it weird but there’d be times when I’d be with my little brother when he was like 4 and he’d be like “[BRO], tell the girl to go away!”. He’d get extremely mad and tell something that wasn’t there to go away. This would happen somewhat often and he’d suddenly wine for me to tell the girl to go away. I was really dumbfounded so one day I went up and spun around in the area he pointed to so I could maybe feel if something was there or if I could hopefully scare her away. I never asked him what she looked like. She would pop up here and there until about 5 months later and my little brother didn’t complain again. I’m kinda jealous because my sister and I never saw ghosts."

t3_ewqm7n,all_ads,Repeat What I Say,Thetruthishere,"Have you ever experienced taking care of a child who keeps repeating what everyone says? Have you had any creepy or scary experience while doing it?

I've been babysitting this lovely child for two months now since her parents' business started to grow out. It was just a part-time job since our houses aren't really that far and I was just a Sophomore. She was so adorable and is such a good girl who doesn't really need any special care or attention.

Since she's just two and a half years old, she's just starting to talk. She would babble, gurgle and even giggle by herself whenever she would play with her toys and it was honestly so cute.

One thing that her parents and I immediately noticed was that she started to imitate the words that the people around her were saying.

So whenever I would babysit her, I would also teach her about letters and basic words that she would quickly learn and repeat. It was obvious that she was kind of a smart child.

But her speech slightly got worse as she even imitates curse words that she would accidentally hear. It was hard to get it off of her, but her parents and I somehow did it.

The creepy stuff happened when her parents went out of town for a week and I was in charge of her for a whole day until her grandmother arrived in the night. 

I just finished cooking lunch when she pulled the hem of my shirt. I turned to her and she said:

""Die!""

And then she just ran upstairs.

I was stunned and went to her room to ask her where she learned that word, but then when I opened her door she threw a teddy bear at me, which she never does until now.

""Die, die, die!"" She keeps chanting as it was obvious that she doesn't know what she was talking about or what the word even meant.

I picked her up from the bed and I asked her where she learned that word from. But she just kept chanting ""die!"" for reasons still unknown to me.

I was confused as to how she learned that word and from whom or where.

She was in the living room while I was cooking and there's a large window behind their sofa where she was playing with her toys. It was possible that she could've heard it from outside, but I would've heard it too since their house is fairly small.

The TV was off since she doesn't like to watch anything and the neighbors rarely even fight.

I remember that day being quiet, just like any other day. So it was really confusing where she would pick up that word.

When her grandmother arrived, it was a mystery as to how she stopped saying the annoying word as I tried the whole dang day for her to stop saying it to no avail.

I never told anyone what happened because her parents might get the wrong idea. I would never say anything bad in front of a child, especially this one who keeps repeating one specific word.

How about you guys? Have you had any similar experiences?"

t3_ewragu,all_ads,Dreadful sensation/spiritual battle,Thetruthishere,"I've always wanted to share this experience with people in order to get feedback, but due to the nature of private and intimate moments that lead to it, it has always stopped me from sharing it with friends and family. Well I cut out the obvious parts when it came to telling my family about it. 

One night around Fall of 2018, my girlfriend and I felt a dark presence in her room that I denied feeling but ended up battling from 2am till sunrise. 

My girlfriend lives at home with her parents in a , recently built well off neighborhood. We are both college students who attend different schools in town but somehow manage to spend everyday and night together. Around november of 2018 both her parents were out of town, at least one of them wouldnt be back for 2 weeks more. So of course I stayed over and we enjoyed ourselves. One night we get home late, I had picked her up from school after a long day and we were ready to shower and head to bed. For whatever reason starting from the drive from her school, my mind could not concentrate on anythiny, and I was getting annoyed. We get the idea of using her parents walk in shower because it was nicer than her restroom. 

We're in the walkin shower, glass panels/door covered in fog as we use the hottest water setting   because women like boiling water. But for whatever reason the restroom still felt cold even as the hot water steamed off our skin. From the corner of my eye, in my peripheral vision I see a shadow move across the floor just outside the shower, I ignore it because it was just the corner of my eye I said. Things get intimate between my girlfriend and I, and suddenly she breaks down crying in the middle of it. I ask her whats wrong and she says she just got overwhelmed with dread. Again I see a shadow in the floor through my peripheral vision, but my focus went back to my girlfriend and my lack of focus. Suddenly within a second of looking away from the glass panel as I tried to figure out the shadow situation I take a look again and all the fog in the glass panels and mirrors is gone, all within a second. .. my girlfriend also noticed it and was intrigued by it but we made no mention  of it till the next day. 

Later that night, for whatever reason we both went to bed upset without saying goodnight to each other. Within an hour I have a nightmare that people(in my dream they were tall gray shadows) had broken in to the house via the garage, and in my dream my girlfriend wouldnt wake up so I ran outside with her on my arms and start yelling for help. My girlfriend then wakes me up because I'm actually sleep talking saying ""help me, help"". 

We both get up and go to her restroom just down the hall, I remove my contacts because I'm an optometrist biggest nuisance, and as we walk back to her room I tell her about my nightmare. She gets spooked after she closes her bedroom and wonders if we closed the garage door after coming home late. I offered to go check it out but she seems frightens and tells me to stay inside, I didnt think much of it and I say fine, I'll check the window and look at the garage. To no surprised everything looks fine. My girlfriend suddenly rushes to bed and ask me to lay down, I do and open my phone. She immediately yanks it away and tells me to fall asleep. 

As soon as I laid to my side to cuddle her, something hits me. A feeling like no other.  I felt something extremely heavy in the atmosphere, specially from outside her room, a feeling of fear and uncertainty. It's completely hard to describe it, if paranormal yet evil was a feeling it was definitely it. To my biggest fear my girlfriend asks me "" do you feel that?"" My heart starts to feel like its about to explode, but I dont want to admit it or make her feel scared and I say, "" I dont feel anything, why dont you pray to help fall asleep."" I had never before told her to pray, and in my head I began to pray "" Our father"" followed by the words ""God bless this house"" in my head. As soon as those words were said that feeling intensified with anger, and again the worst and last thing I wanted to hear from my girlfriend were said, ""I think it just got angry... after praying"" I tell her its nothing but this time I know for a fact that this was not a Godly thing, and we may be in danger, my girlfriend then says ""its going to get worse before it gets better"" and again I insist that I don't feel anything and for her to fall asleep. 

I begin to pray endlessly, reciting "" Our Father "" over and over again, the angry feeling faded but we both felt it was still there, as my girlfriend later described it ""like someone pointing a gun at us only to lower it but not holster it away"", I faintly hear a small whisper saying ""zooh"" or maybe ""azul"" from behind me. My girlfriend again not helping asks ""did you hear that? Sounds like a distant cry"" as I still cuddled well big spooned ky girlfriend as we both faced her door, too frighten to give it our back. She finally dozes off, but I continue praying "" Our Father"" over and over and over again. But at a certain point it felt like what I would start to describe as a demon, began messing with me, mentally, and spiritually. While I prayed, words would get stuck in my mind, the our father which I knew by heart would be warbled in my head but I knew I couldn't stop. I kept praying either finishing it off or starting from the beginning. Behind me again I heard a whisper, but this time mocking me ""help me. Help  me."" I looked over my shoulder and towards the window as I continued praying waiting for sunrise as a feeling inside me reassured me it would be over then. 

Just around 6am before sunrise, even in a half sleep state, I prayed. Till finally I dreamnt and the feeling slightly diminished. I was dreaming I was in the bedroom as if everything was as it were while I slept, I got up from bed and opened the door. Infront of me was a young girl, roughly 4 years old, but in my dream I knew this was a disguise, I knew this was a mischief incarnate, as best as I could describe it. I assertively commanded it to move away and let me and my girlfriend pass. It laughed, I know had my girlfriend behind me for in my dream I wanted to get her to safety. This time when I looked at it again it was no longer a little girl but a mischievous looking demon maybe even shorter than the little girl roughly  3 ft tall. Again I assertively demanded it move away, it was weaker than when we first encountered it that night and in my dream I manage to carry my girlfriend pass the demon and fled the house. 

Finally I awoke in the morning, all feeling was gone. Again we stupidly showered in her moms shower, I rushed us even got upset that we were taking long, my girlfriend said I could leave the shower before her and get dressed but I refused and we finished. I really wanted to talk about that night, but I was scared and was even more reluctant to make her scared. But I knew it was unsafe so as soon as we drove away from her street I brought it up. I told her I felt it, she was surprised and asked what I was talking about. I said I felt what you felt last night, but I didnt want to frighten her. She got very upset that I denied it and we discussed what happened. 

The aftermath of this is just as interesting but its alot to type and I'm at a cafe typing on my phone.  Needless to say we still feel it in her house when her parents are away. 2 or maybe 3 of our mutual friends we've had over have felt it as well just differently. Even before we told them about it, a friend of ours broke down crying over a feeling of dread and feeling unwelcomed."

t3_ewqvoi,all_ads,Something I haven't talked about but may happen again - the radio,Thetruthishere,"If you don't know, I'm somewhat of a goof, and I don't know how many years ago this was, but I know it was around Christmastime (I think) because I was making a spoof of Alvin and the chipmunks when I was in my teen years and I was just in my room one day and the radio randomly came on and a chipmunks song came on and I was like ""what the?"" And I didn't touch it. There is a slider on the radio that can change it from off to alarm to radio and it was on the off position.

It was odd because only a few people knew I was doing the chipmunks spoof and it was weird because it was in the off position. Could have been faulty or coincidental, but also seems sorta specific that it came on exactly to a chipmunks song.

I know that paranormal entities and beings can interact with the physical world, but this looks very specific to be considered a faulty radio."

I remember seeing a recent-ish documentary on this and a British chemist (Dr Emsley) said that the cause was a build up of a pyrophoric liquid called diphosphane which has been recently found to be present in the gut. In extremely rare occurrences, the gut malfunctions and produces too much of this and once it reaches a certain concentration it ignites, which also ignites all the gasses in the intestines, producing an explosion that tears through the abdomen causing a person to burn from the inside out and burst into flames.

Would that be a painful death? If so would you die from burning or suffocation from the smoke? Or would you just instantly go into shock and pass out?"

t3_evjex9,all_ads,Disturbing Phone Call,Thetruthishere,"So I was hesitant to post this because I'm generally a skeptic, and I'm sure the real explanation is quite mundane; however, it's been bugging me for the last few weeks, and I'm curious to know what other people think about this.

First, some background. A few weeks ago, I was on vacation alone in North Carolina, and was staying at this AirBnB in the middle of nowhere. It was night time, and the area was very dark and remote. Add in the fact that I was, for some reason, watching some creepy ass Nexpo videos on Youtube at the time, and I ended up in a very skittish mood. That being said, even if I wasn't, this experience would have freaked me out. While lying in bed and relaxing I was texting this girl I'm seeing when, suddenly, my phone rang. Now, I generally answer phone calls, even from unknown numbers, if I'm not particularly busy. So, without looking too close at the number I answered the phone and said, ""Hello?"" In response, all I got was crying. By crying, what I really mean is a hysterical bawling. Really all I could pull from the voice was that it was female, and she was clearly troubled. I tried repeating my hello, and asking if she's alright, but all I got was more crying. It lasted about 5 seconds more, then the phone hung up suddenly. 

This absolutely chilled my blood and left me paralyzed with fear. The crying was haunting. I just sat there for awhile, then tried sending a text to the number, but I got an error message which is characteristic of trying to text a land line. It was at that point that I noticed the phone number had the wrong number of digits for a US phone number; however, the number was in my call history in no particular format. Just a sequence of 12 numbers with no dashes anywhere. 

The experience really stuck with me, messing up my groove for the last few days of my vacation. Partly because it was just plain disturbing, but also because I didn't have the courage to call the number back. Honestly, it still leaves me a little uncomfortable at night, even though I am now home and surrounded by people I trust. I'm open to any suggestions about what the hell this was, or any comments at all. Like I said, I'm sure the actual explanation is quite mundane, but maybe someone will enjoy digging into this a bit."
t3_evggqo,all_ads,I found something I shouldn’t have.,Thetruthishere,"tl;dr —me and a friend found strange mounds in the middle of the forest and then got chased by a man with dogs—

I went hiking with one of my old friends. He used to be homeless and in a bad situation with his parents so I let him stay with me until he got on his feet. 

One evening before he officially started staying, we went to go get his stuff from the woods he was posted up at that night. It’s probably 11pm or midnight when we met up (I had work and got off late), we go to the woods to pick up his stuff and we kind of got lost in the dark. It was abnormally dark considering the full moon was fixing to come around for its phase. Neither of us had flashlights and my phone had died so I couldn’t use that. Bad planning, I’ll admit. 

We stumble across a bunch of decently large mounds of dirt in this offshoot of the woods. Each mound had a small tree growing from the middle and a crude blank sign at the tops. 
At this point it is eerily quiet considering on our way over the woods were insanely loud with cicadas and whatnot. We hear a branch snap nearby while trying to look at these mounds and decide to get back to finding his stuff. 

We eventually found his “campsite” and hurried out. Outside of the woods now, we’re walking down a one way street leading to the main road. A large moving truck comes our way and slowly passes us by. We pay it no mind and just nod and keep going. The truck turns around and pulls around into a little offshoot on our right, stopping parallel to us with the engine on. The driver gets out and just watches us. We weren’t being conspicuous or anything by looking back, just glances over the shoulder here and there. Nothing you could make out in the darkness from the distance he was anyhow. 

We’re almost at the top of the street and to my car when he goes to the back of his truck and I guess opens the back door. The next thing we hear is at least three dogs barking their heads off and a flashlight pointed our way. 

We started running and had to do some evading through nearby neighbourhood streets before we could get back to my car.

Nothing ever came of that afterwards. No cops, no local town chatter, nothing. Well, more did but that’s a different story altogether."
t3_ew05im,all_ads,I saw a ghost,Thetruthishere,"So, when I was 3, I distinctively remember this. I was in bed, and from where my bed was, I could stare directly at the bathroom. And one night, I saw two, glowing red eyes at least 7 feet off the ground. No figure, just eyes."
t3_ev9z6d,all_ads,"My grandma wishing me a good journey, and other stories and tidbits (X-post from /r/paranormal)",Thetruthishere,"I need to set the scene a little. First things first, I’m not sure if I really believe in ghosts and the paranormal in general, but I’m certainly fascinated by it and always have been. That being said, I only ever had this one experience (knock on wood).

In 2014, I travelled abroad alone for the first time in my life. I was 20 then and was going to spend a week on a Scottish island. Those were also the very first flights I ever took. Now, my grandma was an extremely anxious woman, and a religious woman, so the day before I was to leave for my holiday, she hugged me and gave me a little gold chain with a cross on it. It was to keep me safe, a talisman of sorts. It’s perhaps worth noting that I’m not religious myself, but you best believe I carried that little chain in my wallet all the time.

The following year, 2015, my grandma passed in June. While it was obviously very sad, it was not unexpected, as she was 86 years old and had been badly cancer sick for years. To be honest, I was mostly just relieved that she was finally no longer in pain when she passed away. I do still miss her terribly though.

Now we finally get to the good part. In August 2015, so two months after my grandma died, I travelled to Scotland again, this time with my best friend. Now, my grandma had lived with my aunt in the coziest little house for around 35 years. I LOVE that place and I feel completely at home and at peace when I’m there. It’s an old and kind of dark house, but not creepy at all. When I was 8 or so, my parents built a house right next to it, so my aunt and grandma and us in the other house became neighbors. The day before I would leave for my 2015 holiday, I went over to my aunt to say bye to her. The layout of her house is like this: you walk through the entrance door and you’re in the living room. To the right side is what used to be my grandma’s bedroom, or you can walk straight ahead through a narrow, short corridor, which has doors on the left side to the bathroom and to a little pantry. When you walk through the corridor, you reach a sort of dining room. Between the corridor and the dining room, there’s an old wooden door. It’s painted white, and it has a thick panel of opaque glass in it (am I making sense? English is my second language).

On that evening, the moment I set foot in the dining room, I heard three knocks on that glass panel, in rapid succession. It sounded exactly like someone tapping the glass with their fingernail.

Now, I’m aware that there’s probably a rational explanation for this. It’s an old wooden door, it creaks and such, or maybe me planting my foot in the dining room sent vibrations through the floor which caused the old door to make that sound. But please, bear in mind that over the course of 20 years, I walked through that door almost every. Single. Day. Thousands of times, and it never ONCE made a sound anything close to this, and it hasn’t since. Nor did I ever hear it make that sound when someone else walked through, which, again, I witnessed thousands of times. So, the door made a sound that somehow sounded exactly like a fingernail tapping the glass panel rapidly three times, which had never happened before and has never happened since, on the eve of my departing for a holiday abroad? You be the judge of how likely that sounds, but those are some coincidences.

After the incident, I was a little spooked, but not scared. It was immediately evident to me that it was just my grandma wishing me a good journey and asking me to be careful. Note that I’m usually a skeptic, albeit interested in the paranormal, and I do not believe in life after death.

(Un)fortunately, that’s the only experience I ever had. However, my aunt has more stories. Now, my aunt is not one to make up stories. She’s not the creative type, but she’s a very direct, no-bullshit kind of person, very independent and tough as nails. I have never ever seen her shed a tear, not even when grandma died. She’s just not a very outwardly emotional person. I love her very much and I have no reason to disbelieve her. She told me that she would often catch a whiff of my grandma’s perfume coming from what used to be her bedroom. She said the scent was particularly strong in the evening, when my grandma used to sit in the living room and watch TV. One night, my aunt was in her bedroom, when she heard knocking on the wall from my grandma’s room (their rooms are adjacent to one another), just like grandma used to do towards the end when she had already become bed-ridden and needed something from my aunt. The most incredibly experience (told to me by my aunt completely casually, as if it isn’t the coolest and creepiest thing ever) was one night when my aunt was again sitting in her room, when she started hearing knocking sounds coming from the direction of the bathroom. The sound moved from the bathroom to the pantry, then to the dining room, and finally to the kitchen which is right next to my aunt‘s room. So there’s this knocking that sounds like it’s coming from inside the cupboards, some banging from the pans in there or whatever, and it’s moving ever closer to her, so what does my aunt do? She yells „Goddamnit mom, I know you’re here! Stop being creepy!“ — silence. The sound is gone and does not start up again. This part always makes me laugh because who yells at their dead mom‘s ghost? My aunt, that’s who.

Over the years, my aunt has had a few more minor experiences, mostly the scent of perfume. It stopped when she got rid of the TV in the living room. Then, in December of 2018, an aneurysm burst in my aunt’s head. She came very, very close to dying. If my dad had not miraculously found her after just a few minutes, she would have died on the spot. She was in a coma for weeks, developed pneumonia, the works. She’s also in her 50’s, a heavy smoker and just not in great shape. So basically, the doctors told us it’s not looking very good. But my aunt pulled through and gradually got better and better. Today, she’s completely recovered and 100 % back to her own self. A few weeks after she woke up from her coma, she told us that when she was still in the coma, she had talked to my grandma who had told her it’s not her time to go yet. My aunt now is completely, steadfastly convinced that my grandma is her guardian angel who made my dad find my aunt on the floor and administer first aid and save her life.

So, that’s it. Make of that what you will! I know I don’t understand it. It’s difficult to reconcile when your own personal experience and that of loved one‘s you have no reason not to believe clashes with what you perceive as reality. For me, that means that while I do not believe in any kind of god, nor in the afterlife, and I’m unconvinced about ghosts and paranormal stuff like that, I myself have experienced something I cannot easily explain, as had my aunt who I believe fully and would trust with my life. And the funny thing is, most people you talk to have some kind of ghost story, don’t they? Each of my parents does, my buddy in the office does, and I know of so many others. Let’s not even go into the stories my in-laws from Vietnam have. Ghosts and such are a completely normal part of life there, especially for the older generation. Talk to any older Vietnamese person, and I guarantee they have at least one incredible story.

So, where does that leave us? I don’t know. I don’t understand."
t3_evirj0,all_ads,Tips from the 6th sense experience,Thetruthishere,"So, this is going to be one part journey one part creepypasta, but bare with me.

So, my moms side of the family has always been sensitive. Seeing spirits, feeling things, etc. When I was younger I could see spirits and sense when they were near. I could also feel weight displacements and the like and sense intent from said beings. To say, not all are good or evil. Some just doing their thing. 


Growing up I had trouble sleeping and naturally became a night owl. I could only sleep on my sides or i'd get sleep paralisis. It was in my teens that I supposedly would visit other planes. A forest home, a golden city on a hillside, the dark church, various places. I would also have experiences with malevolent spirits who would spiritually oppress me.

It would happen, and I would struggle and struggle, until I managed to break free. Kicker being, I didn't just break the oppression, I've broken out of my own body. The first time being in Japan. I went to sleep and woke up out of my body. Would keep walking away from it and repeatedly got pulled back by a tether or chain. It got to the point where if I was oppressed, I could at times break out of my body all together. So this story is one such example. 

I woke up and felt this immensly oppressive force, sensing something not so good nearby. I faught and steuggled and broke free. Regaining consciousness near our bathroom (outside my room) and has this almost instinctual calling. Something is in the house that shouldnt be, find it. This was not the first time, and I had learned prior to catch my sliritual breath. Because its very similar to being physically pinned, its exhausting.

Moving forward, I went into my roomies room. I looked around and saw this 7 foot tall grey humanoid. It was just staring at him as my friend layed flat in his bed. But when it took its eyes off him and looked at me, my friend shot up in his bed, 90 degree sitting. The thing then transformed and tried to shoot past me, but I intercepted it and wrestled. I woke up in my body then, and the next day asked the roomie about it, being intentionally vague. He had told me he woke up abruptly at that time said morning from an unpleasant dream or something.

Ive had many such experiences, in and out of body. Always that same instinct, get whatever it is out. Find it. So here are a few tips should you find yourself in a pinch, from experience.

1. Do not be afraid, such things feed on that. It weakens you and empowers them. 
2. Rage and confidence are both very potent. I had once been lifted out of my bed (spiritual form) by the neck by some tall cloaked black thing. Its face hidden in shadows. I got mad, really mad, pissed. How dare it do this to me! I was trying to sleep and am sick of this! I reached out with my own arm and grabbed its neck. And with that rage, snapped it. Regained consciousness after. Though rage isnt as reliable as Ive noticed rage and fear are closely linked, and can swap easily. Confidence, or the belief that you are strong is best.

I look at it like a shield, a wall that defends you. It is as strong or as weak as you allow. And with said confidence Ive been able to go toe to toe with some things. Course, I'm still very inexperienced as its not a state I try to get into, I'd rather just be asleep.

3. If paralized, wiggle ur toes. Trust me, its odd but works. Itll help you slowly regain control of your body. That, or be a stubborn fuck like I am some days and thrash about. 

4. Some stones and items do amplify your defences. Malachite, for example is a staple of mine. I've used obsidian too, but have noticed the defensive bubble is smaller. Its hard to explain, but I can tell how close or far things are. 


Don't get me wrong, all of your houses and such likely have some resident spirits or beings, but not nearly as many as you'd think want to hurt you. Many just observe, or just chill. And I have had experiences with protective spirits as well.

Honestly curious how to develop things, but ive no interest without bolstering my own defences.

TlDR: Against bad spirits, wiggle ur toes when oppressed, and fight back with a fortified mind or anger. Anger if the former isn't availible. I'd say its why poltergeists are so strong. Rage is a powerful emotion, albeit a fragile one."
t3_evl0hc,all_ads,"Bass amp ""broke"" but I think it was a warning",Thetruthishere,"So I was gonna practice my bass, but I tried to turn on my amp. But I saw, it wasn't plugged in. But it was plugged in since I got it and I never unplugged it and I thought, Hmm, weird. How did it unplug itself? But then, when I plugged it in, I turned it on, but it only stayed on for a while, but I thought it was just broken, or the on/off switch was loose. Whenever I turn it on, the indicator light flashes for about 10 secs, then I see it turn off as if someone was. But then I heard this kinda knocking, maybe spirit rappings. I knew something was up and asked, Hey, Are you doing this? 1 knock for yes, 2 for no. And then I heard 1, short, but pretty loud rapping. I asked, are you telling me not to play my bass? Then I heard 1 knock. And then I asked, will something bad happen if I play my bass today? And then I heard a knock. It sounded as if it was knocking on my amp, and pretty clearly too. 

So please, is this just a technical problem with my amp? (Never had any problems all my life) or paranormal?

Edit, after this post, I heard lots of knocks, each closer than the other. Is it angry that I'm telling everyone?"
t3_euyc2y,all_ads,Hearing something run across the roof and in my backyard at around 3 am,Thetruthishere,So for the last couple weeks I've been hearing something run across my roof then run in my backyard past my bedroom window at first I thought it was the neighborhood's cat since it I could see it walk thru the yard from time to time but it's been while a since I saw it and it also never ran just walked even when it saw me thru the window it would stare at me for a while and then run away but it wouldn't make a sound whatever has been running over my room and backyard seems to have some weight to it since I can it's steps when it dashes on my roof or pass my window
t3_euzbc2,all_ads,I Think I Died In My Sleep,Thetruthishere,"I think I died in my sleep and came back.

I had a dream that I was wandering the woods I was most familiar with. It was spring in the woods, despite being fall outside. The dream had overcast with shadows that seemed to loom a bit harsher and darker than necessary. I smiled and walked through, happy to be there. I got hit with the most sickening sense of doom I had ever felt and ran panicked to a rock that I would go to when I had anxiety. My grandma was sitting there (she had passed away the year before). I tried to hug her, but she said, ""If you touch me, you'll never be able to leave. You need to leave right now before they know you are here. The shadows whisper when they think no one is looking. You need to go back right now before you're trapped here forever."" I freaked out even more and ran blindly, not knowing where to go, but following some weird gut feeling, as if I was being pulled by a string. I knew something was looking for me. I was about to reach my grandma's house when I fell into a hole in the ground. I didn't feel that falling feeling, but like when you jump off the 4th stair up. At the bottom of the hole, I saw myself ""sleeping"" in my bed. I didn't have time to notice if I was breathing or not. 

I woke up when I landed in my body and slowly gained back my vision from dark to blurry and realized I never opened my eyes (I have Christmas lights in my room I leave on when I sleep). It took a while before I was breathing normally, like when you have the wind knocked out of you. My heart was racing from the terror of what I had experienced. My chest hurt like Chuck Norris full on kicked me as hard as he could square in the middle of it and I was weak and exhausted for days. I had a lot of memory loss after too, and short term memory was the hardest. I couldn't remember what I had done 30 seconds ago if you'd asked me. It was weird."
t3_euyv98,all_ads,I believe I have a sixth sense,Thetruthishere,"I know that humans have more than 5 sense, but most people know those 5 because they are the primary ones. But I believe I have another primary one. Or maybe two to be exact. The first one is that I can feel when I am about to meet someone. For example, if I go to the store, I may joke around that I'll find someone that I know, but must of the time I dont feel it. But there are always exceptions. You may call it a guy feeling, but I get this feeling that I will find someone I know, from church or school, or past school, or even neighbors. And I do. So far whatever this is has not been wrong yet
The second one, and perhaps a more common one is when I know that someone is following me. Also watching me, but must importantly, following. It has happened at school, when friends try to scare me. I get this tingling sensation in the back of my neck when someone is getting near me, way to close to be passing by. And it also works. None of my friends have been able to scare me, in fact, I scare them because I turn around the second before they jump on me. Does this happen to anyone too here? Or perhaps something different, but that you also believe it is something of a sixth sense?"
t3_euymj7,all_ads,This threatening shadow person,Thetruthishere,"(First of all, Sorry for my English)
Have anybody ever saw a shadow person , but not the tipical standing one, I mean the kind that threats you with cursings and things like that?
This happened to me like 20 something years ago, my mom worked the late shift at the local market and i often waited for her to arrive home around 2 AM, she was a single mom it was just her and me, I was watching TV infomercials around 1 am and suddenly this man called me like sh, sh and when I turned my head to the kitchen there was this man whit a cape an a hat like the monopoly man, dressed like some magician but I could not see his face even though the TV was lightening him from the front, he says "" what you're looking at moron"" I'm going to kill you if you don't turn around"" and something else I can't remember because as soon as he finished the second phrase I got out of the house to the neighbors and waited for mom there. When she arrived I told her everything, then she and the neighbors searched the house up and down but everything was normal, to this day i don't know if them believed me but I swear i was no more comfortable living or staying in that house, I never saw him again but I always felt watched, fortunately a couple of months later we moved and that was it."
t3_euiw6j,all_ads,(Long) My friends and I summoned something years ago,Thetruthishere,"This is my experience that made me completely believe in ghosts. It happened several years ago at my friend’s 14th birthday party/sleepover. In the group, there was me, Emily (the one throwing the party), Dae, Hayley, August, and Anne. (Fake names for anonymity).

Basically, while the rest of the group was doing something else, Dae and I were hanging out away from them and started looking at a list of ritual games for shits and giggles. Dae believed in ghosts and I was on the fence, but we didn’t really believe in the validity of anything we were looking at because the website was called something along the lines of “creepy for kids.”

We found a game called Catscratch, and to be blunt, it sounded so stupid and easy that we couldn’t resist. On the website, there were two different poems that both had something to do with cats. I think one of them was about an old lady with a mean cat, and the other one was about some giant cat with red eyes stalking you through an alleyway. Anyways, Person 1 lays down and puts their head in Person 2’s lap. 2 rubs 1’s temples and recites one of the poems. At the end, 1 sits up, 2 pulls up their shirt, and there’s supposed to be scratches on 1’s back.

We told the rest of the group about it, and we ended up trying it out sometime around 1 AM. My recollection of everything from this point is kind of hazy because it was so long ago, but I know that Dae and I went first. I was the one getting scratched, Dae read the story about the cat in the alleyway. I didn’t feel anything while they read the story to me, I just kept giggling because I thought the imagery with the giant evil cat was so stupid.

I don’t think anyone believed that anything would happen, but when I sat up and Dae pulled up my shirt, we were all really shocked to see that I actually had scratches. It didn’t burn or hurt at all, it just felt like a slight cool breeze across my back. I wasn’t scared, just hyped because I’ve always thought that the paranormal was super interesting. I don’t think anyone was able to get a photo in time because they faded quickly, but they all said that there were three small scratches that weren’t really deep, but were definitely noticeable.

Anyways, we kept playing for awhile after that. I don’t remember the exact order that everyone went in, but here’s everything that I can recall:

August had absolutely nothing to do with any of this, she watched from the corner while playing games on her phone.

I know for a fact that Emily was never the one that was being scratched, but she read the story/rubbed someone’s temples at least once.

I think that Dae read the story for someone else one other time, but was definitely the one being scratched at least once.

Emily read the story for Anne and I think she didn’t get any scratches at all. That, or they were really small and insignificant. I’d also like to add that Anne came from a more spiritual family and she had a protection ring. 

Either way, everything was mostly tame until we got to Hayley. She was the one being scratched, and I think Dae read the story. When Hayley sat up, the scratches across her back were huge. She initially only had three, but those three were getting longer and deeper, and eventually more started to appear. They would all fade quickly but more just kept appearing. At one point, she was getting six at once and they were all lightly bleeding. We all stopped playing after this, and Anne insisted on giving Hayley her protection ring despite Hayley being wary about it. 

I don’t completely trust my memory with this detail, but I think at some point, Hayley also started to get scratches across her chest and her stomach. Even if that didn’t happen, though, the scratches across her back eventually got so bad that she ended up taking off her shirt so she wouldn’t bleed on it.

Up until Hayley, we were all in the living room, but we all went into Emily’s bedroom once her scratches started to get a lot worse. At the time, Emily was a Christian, and she had a giant cross on her bedroom wall that she believed would protect all of us. She was the only one out of the group that was a Christian. If I remember correctly, nothing happened to Emily while she was in the bedroom, but Hayley was still getting scratches.

Dae and I were the ones that eventually left the bedroom to go get some salt. Nothing happened to us physically, but as soon as we stepped out of the room, there was definitely an oppressive feeling in the air. Dae asked me something along the lines of, “Did you just get hit with the saddest feeling right now?” I think it actually made me feel more anxious and panicked than sad, but either way, we got the salt and we poured some on Emily’s doorway, windowsills, room corners, and we all put some in our pockets.

After that, Hayley stopped getting scratches and we were all trying to figure out what to do because we didn’t know if there was still something outside of the room. At some point, Anne faked getting possessed and started mumbling gibberish (I think she admitted to Emily that she faked it years later, but even if she didn’t, none of us were really believing it because it was obviously fake). August started having a panic attack but we calmed her down.

Eventually, Emily got hungry and wanted someone to go into the kitchen with her, and I volunteered. She was grabbing some slices of pizza when she suddenly froze and started saying, “Lift up my shirt, lift up my shirt, something feels weird.”

I did, and I don’t even know how to describe what I saw. A little below the middle of her back, there was a smooth, wavy line, but it didn’t look red or irritated at all. It definitely wasn’t a scratch. It looked like those body mods where people get implants of things like stars under their skin, and the longer I looked at it, the more it popped out.

I hurried Emily back to her room, but it was gone by the time we got in there (it wasn’t any more than ten seconds between leaving the kitchen and getting back to her room). Anne ended up calling her mom and asking her what we should do. She told us to do a banishment ritual, and we ended up making a salt circle around Emily and Hayley (and me, because I wasn’t fucking around even though nothing really happened to me), chanting something, and probably some other steps that I don’t remember. Either way, it seemed to work. By the time we were done with that, it was around 3-4 AM.

Anyways, some other details I feel like could be relevant while looking back on everything:

1. Emily told us later that she was pretty sure her house was haunted before we did this. She had just moved there, too. I don’t know if anything paranormal continued in her house after that night. 
2. This happened during our summer break in between the 8th grade and our first year of high school. I mainly blame it on the nature of our town and how chaotic this period of teenagers’ lives tend to be, but Emily ended up going down a really rough path. We don’t really talk anymore. One of my friends that wasn’t involved in any of this told me that, the last time she heard from Emily, she smoked meth and then stole $100 worth of makeup from another friend, so there’s that.
3. Emily was never the one being scratched, she just read the story, but she still ended up getting that weird line.
4. Hayley is a HORRIBLE person. She was my friend at the time, but she’s extremely manipulative, abusive, and one of the biggest liars I’ve ever met. She’s out of all of our lives now, thankfully.
5. Despite Dae and I both being scratched in the ritual, nothing directly/physically happened to us afterwards, not counting the weird oppressive feeling that we both felt.
6. August, Dae, and I are all still very close, but we were never friends with Anne, Emily dropped off of the face of the earth, and we cut Hayley out of our lives. The three of us still talk about it and we never really figured out what happened that night.

That was all pretty long, so thank you for reading this far. I hope it was easy enough to follow, sorry if it’s a little scattered. If you have any theories about what was going on, I’d love to hear them.

Edit: Changed the initials into fake names for easier reading

Edit 2: Looking back on it, I’m honestly wondering if we summoned multiple entities? This would make sense to me considering the fact that we played it multiple times, and Emily’s house may have already been haunted. I think something there was definitely malevolent, judging by the oppressive feeling + the mark Emily got + Hayley’s scratches, but the situation with Hayley confuses me due to her nature as a person. Now that we cut her out of our lives due to her toxicity, I honestly wonder if the scratches she was getting were meant to be some sort of warning about her. That, or maybe her specific negative energy attracted something darker, which could explain why everyone else went without getting the really bad scratches. That still doesn’t explain what happened with Emily’s mark though, so I wonder what that was? Emily was never the one being scratched to begin with, so that leads me to believe her mark was unrelated to the game. So, maybe there was some sort of malevolent entity + the entity haunting her house + the entity we originally summoned with the game (assuming the malevolent spirit wasn’t the one originally summoned). Or maybe the game spirit was angered by Hayley’s presence/energy? I also think that Emily’s mark was made by something more sinister than a regular spirit because of how strange it was, I’ve never seen anything like it. It looked like something trying to push out of her skin. I really don’t know, I’m rambling lmao. It’s a lot to think about and still interests me."
t3_euht6i,all_ads,The strange figure,Thetruthishere,"So...this happened a few years ago but I don’t remember exactly when.So it’s late in the evening and me and my family got out to eat.A few hours later we come back home and I’m the first to get out of the car and I rush to the door and stand on the porch.I then turn around to see if they were coming...Then I see something standing in the dark and this thing is definitely not a person.This thing just stood there and it was standing there so strangely.I couldn’t move I was so full of fear+shock.After a few seconds it ran away into the pitch black woods.I explained it to my parents but I don’t think they believed me.I searched around the yard for this creature but never saw again.
(I’m new to this btw)"
t3_eugp5b,all_ads,Had a weird dream last night,Thetruthishere,"Was feeling mad anxious last night - a “somethings going to happen” feeling. I couldn’t shake it no matter what I tried - eating, praying etc. Just felt weird and nervous. I went to sleep and had weird dreams (I have dreams that I’ll see play out in real life sometimes, and others that just feel “important”) But i can’t remember those. 

Woke up around 6:30 then fell back to sleep and finally dreamed I had four daughters. (I only have one in rl) I lost the middle one and spent the dream trying to figure out what she looked like so I could find her. 

When I woke up I felt like today was really important, like felt like I had an assignment or something due that I was trying to remember. My husband was on his phone as I was waking up and trying to figure out this feeling when he told me Kobe and his daughter (one of four) died. 
Either because it was just really disheartening to hear and caused a stronger shift in my mood, or because I was feeling the mood from everywhere else abt his death - that anxious/impending feeling felt resolved. Same sensation as remembering something I had forgotten. 

I’m not implying I’m connected to Kobe in any kind of spiritual way - but I feel that I could have been picking up what other people were exuding. His death is pretty touching to almost everyone, he’s a household name so I believe that grief and surprise energy is huge right now. Does anyone think I could have been sensing the mood of people around me? 

I don’t like to give this too much presence, but I know things ahead of time pretty often. I sense stuff. I dream things, think things then hear it said by someone or hear it on tv. I have reoccurring numbers that change with my moods and unforeseen events. I’ve thought of someone before with the intention of getting them to write to me, and they did. I also think I have some ability to channel people, but again I don’t explore it or put too much presence on that. 

Am I just being presumptuous with this created self-importance or does this resonate with anyone?"
t3_eu3ckc,all_ads,Want opinions on things my brother saw when we were kids.,Thetruthishere,"Everyone here is so helpful and seems to have a large knowledge base when it comes to these things so I was hoping to get some insight into some events that happened when my brother and I were younger. I used to keep a journal when I was younger and just found it after my wife and I moved. Inside, I had written about the events and it made me start thinking about them again so I decided to talk to my parents and brother to clarify some things and post this for some insight. This may be a long post, so I'm very thankful in advance for anyone who reads and replies!

This all took place when I was around 9 and my brother was 2ish. We moved to a small town in Tennessee into my mother's childhood home to take care of my grandmother who was sick with cancer. 

Life was as normal as it could be given the situation for a while, but then strange things started to happen. Things would be misplaced or out of place. Lights turned on or off when we got back home. Small stuff. Around this same time, my brother started to talk to an imaginary friend. No body thought anything of it because, hey, he's a little kid. My brother only referred to him as ""the black man"" because he wouldn't tell him his name (after my brother got older, he clarified that it wasn't an african american man, but black as in dark, like a shadow). He would only talk to him in my parents' bedroom because, according to my brother, that's where he lived. More specifically, he lived behind my parents' dresser which was cater-cornered on the left side of their room by a closet. He told us that he had met the black man because he smelled something really bad, like a ""poot"" in his words, and heard crying. He thought it was mom, so he went into their room and saw him crying behind the dresser.

My brother and the black man continued conversing in my parents' room nearly every day. It all seemed like innocent kid stuff, like ""how old are you, I'm almost 3"" and ""what's your favorite food? That's gross, I like chips"" simple stuff like that. But then one night it seemed to turn more ominous. My brother finished eating and ran into my parents' room as usual to play. Everything was normal at first, but then we heard my brother sounding more anxious and heard him say ""No, you can't do that, that's mean"". A pause, and then ""but I love them"" and he started crying and ran out of the room.  My dad asked him about it but all he said was that they weren't friends anymore because the black man was bad. Months went by. My grandmother ultimately passed away from cancer, my dad ended up being laid off from his job, so an overall down time for our family. 

Then one night, dad and my brother were playing on the bed in my parent's room when my brother suddenly stopped, looked at the dresser and started crying. Dad held him, asking what was wrong, and Dad said he saw my brother tracking something moving around the bed and out the door toward the kitchen. My brother just responded that he didn't wanted to play in there anymore. Dad said it was like he wanted to keep an eye on whatever had left the room.

This continued for several more days. He would be playing, eating, anything, even be in mid sentence speaking, and would freeze up and look at something unseen to us and track it with his eyes. He would always want us to follow him into whatever room he had tracked the thing into. Around this time, my brother started having nightmares but wouldn't ever tell us what they were, but he became obsessed with making sure anything sharp was put up. If my parents had a knife out, he would watch them use it and clean it until he was sure it was safely back in the drawer. If one was left on the counter, whether my parents were done with it or not, he would take it to the sink. Finally, my parents asked him what was going on. My brother said that he wanted to know what the black man was doing because the black man had told him after their fight that he wouldn't leave any of us alone until he got what he wanted. My parents asked what that was and my brother just started crying. 

The next night things came to a head. My brother and I shared a bedroom and we were watching his favorite movie (land before time gang!) for the 1000th time and we fell asleep. I was woken up in the middle of the night to my brother shaking me. I could see his face in the dim light glow. It was pure terror. He had tears running down his face and his lips were trembling. I sat up and started asking him what was wrong and if he was ok over and over. I saw his eyes track from the bedroom door to behind me. My skin started to crawl and smelled a stench like rotten eggs and thought my brother had soiled himself. Then he said ""Be quiet"" a few seconds passed as my heart started to pound and I could feel my throat wanting to close up. Then he screamed ""Nooo!!! He found you! Don't you feel it?! He's tasting you!!"" I thought my heart was going to explode from fear. Then I heard a loud crash from parents' room and frantic shouting from my dad, screaming to my mother to wake up and help him get the kids. The smell instantly went away, our closet door banged shut and the night light went out, plunging us into darkness. We both screamed at the top of our lungs. My parents ran in, picked us up and we left the house to stay in a hotel for the night.

We went to a small Christian school, so the next morning my parents called one of the pastors on the board and they ended up having a meeting. They explained the whole story to them and the board ended up sending several pastors over to our house and they and my parents prayed over it, sort of like blessing it I guess? I'm not sure, it was a weird experience. But whatever it was, it seemed to have worked. Years went by without another mention of the black man. However, he finally made one last appearance. When my brother was 5, we were playing games on the couch when he suddenly stopped playing, stood up on the couch to look out the window into our back yard and said, ""He's back."" I asked if he meant the black man, and he said ""Yes...he's looking at us thru the window. He's so mad. He can't come inside. He can't get what he wants and he's mad."" I think what terrifies me the most about that is that the window was at least 15 ft off the ground, meaning that whatever this thing is was either that tall to be able to look thru the window, or was perched on the side of the house, 15 ft up, looking inside.

&amp;#x200B;

After that day, my brother never mentioned him again. He either stopped seeing the black man or never told us if he did. When my brother was in high school I finally decided to ask him about what he saw. He told me the black man was like a large shadow, but you couldn't see thru him. He had dark red eyes with deep black pupils and a jagged, deformed looking mouth with a long tongue. The rest of his face was featureless and just blackness. And he always knew the black man was around because he could smell him. Sometimes he would wake up from the smell and see him standing at the end of our bed. And when the black man was mad, he shimmer. My brother described it like looking across a black top pavement on a hot day. He said that they started talking about innocent stuff like favorite foods and toys and stuff. But then the black man started asking if he had ever hurt things, like birds or pets and tried to convince him to because it would be fun and they could be best friends if he did. Then he told him to hurt his family, told him to poke us with a knife while we were asleep and then to poke his own neck with the knife and they could play together forever. That was the night my brother became so upset and started having nightmares and is why he was so paranoid about sharp things.

The night of the major event still gives me nightmares. My brother said he had woken up from another nightmare to see the black man standing in our bedroom doorway. He told my brother that my parents had forgotten to put one of the knifes up after dinner, that it was time to go play. My brother woke me up at that point and the black man walked behind me and extended his tongue. My brother claims it was at least 3 ft long, skinny, with a small fork at the end. He says that it went around my neck and up to my ear. When my Dad woke up in the panic, the black man apparently screamed in anger and fled thru the closet. Speaking with Dad about that night, he said that he had an extremely vivid dream. It was so bright he could barely see anything but could see the silhouette of a very tall, broad shouldered person who spoke to him. In a booming voice he said, ""Awaken and flee, for the great serpent, that dragon, has brought his rotten seed down upon you and your house!""

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is a lot to take in. And a lot to believe for other people who aren't as open about these things which is why I hardly ever talk to anyone about it. If it were just my brother, I would have chalked it up to a child's imagination coupled with the stress of moving and the loss of a grandparent. But with so many shared experiences between us all, it's hard to accept that as an explanation. And my father is a no nonsense, straight edge type of man. He's honest, and I don't see a reason in him making up his end of it. Maybe some families are just more susceptible or whatever to these kinds of things? We moved from Adams, TN which, if anyone doesn't know, is famous for the Bell Witch and I can remember weird things happening even there, but those are different stories for another time.

 Thanks again for anyone reading this far and for any input, comments, or insight anyone may have!"
t3_eubfsx,all_ads,Unexplained crying,Thetruthishere,"Not sure if this counts but this morning I woke up to the sound of someone crying. There was only 1 other person in the house so I waited to see if I heard it again. I must have drifted off and heard crying coming from the bathroom on the same floor as my bedroom again. My bedroom is on the top floor and the stairs are quite creaky so I can always tell who's moving around the house. 

Anyway, the crying continues and the bathroom door opens and I hear footsteps. Then there was a knock on my door so I say hello a couple of times to see who it is/if they wanted to come in and talk. However, no one is there. I went downstairs later in the day and ask my housemate (the only other person that has been in the house) if they were crying this morning and they said no they've been downstairs the whole time. So no idea who I heard or why they knocked on my door but if it happens again I'll be moving out straight away because that's some horror film stuff right there.

t3_eu63v8,all_ads,Having a dream about a future event and then immediately forgetting it to then remember having the dream when the future event happens in real life?,Thetruthishere,"This happens randomly, no pattern just random. It’s like Deja Vu I guess. When it happens, I get the memory that I dreamt of the current situation that is happening but sometimes I remember having the deja Vu but something bad happens at the end like an embarrassing situation, someone saying something horrible to me or something attacking me etc. These bad endings have never actually happened and all the situations I have had the deja Vu have been random, for example being in class and looking behind me to look at my friend.


Summary; I experience random scenarios in real life and then when they happen I remember having a dream about that moment days, weeks or even months before the real life event happens. The dream normally ends negatively but it never does in real life."
t3_eu5ytv,all_ads,Did I give a paranormal being a ride home?,Thetruthishere,"So a little background. I’m in the Military. Air Force specifically. I live on a base in the the dormitory. The base is located in the USA.

One particular night on a Saturday night a little over a year ago at about 1:40ish in the morning I was relaxing in my dorm when suddenly, I get hungry. On weekdays I worked from midnight-8am so I did what I normally did when I get hungry in the middle of the night on a weekend. I hopped in my car and drove the nearest fast food place open 24 hours. I grab my food and I head back to base.

There I was across the street from the base. The only thing between me and the gate was a red traffic light. Across the street I can see a figure make an exchange with the security forces guys and then the figure proceeds onto base. The light turns green which prompts me to advance towards the gate. I roll down the window, show the guy my ID, and I drive through. The same figure I saw walk onto base is walking in the side walk now.

Now the thing about this base is it’s really freaking big. I mean, the guy was on foot. Chances are it could take 30 minutes upward to an hour to get to where he was going.

I stopped my car beside him and asked him if he needed a ride. He gladly accepted after stating he lived in a dormitory and entered the backseat of my car. He conveniently lived in the same dormitory I did. We had a mini conversation, but it was a pretty normal. He talked about all the places he’s been to and he kept urging me to try to go to Korea for some reason. I talked a little about my job, but I never stated how long I lived on base or anything time based really. 

Anyway, we reach the dormitory together. He gets out of the car and before closing the door he says, “You only have,” and he stated the exact amount of time I had until my enlistment was over. Then the door closes. I take a moment (I’m talking mere seconds here) to do the math in my head it’s not like I’m counting down the days until my enlistment is over. He was right! I jump out of my car. To my surprise he’s already gone. “Did he sprint to the dorms?” I think to myself. I bolt to the dorms myself only to be greeted by empty corridors. There was no sign of him.

Who was that guy? Why did he urge me to go to Korea so bad? Most importantly, where did he vanish to?

I still think about from time to time this to this day. I never saw the guy again. Coincidentally, I recently met a girl from Korea. She unfortunately had to go back to Korea so I’m planning on taking a trip to see her. Not sure if that’s related, but it’s a thing.

What do you guys think? Who or what was that guy? Am I just crazy or is this some weird paranormal stuff?"
t3_etzp15,all_ads,White feather's floating by and what confirmed it was a sign from the other side,Thetruthishere,"Yesterday I was at work (I'm a receptionist at a medical center) and the desk is next to quite a wide window and it was a quiet moment so I randomly glanced out the window and just as I did a pure white feather gently floated by in the car park I didn't really think much of it but about 5 minutes later I glanced out the window again and another pure white feather floated by the same direction as the other one! I felt that was a sign but what confirmed it was a lady that came in as a patient and I had never met her before but we got talking and she mentioned that she is very psychic and does readings for people as a living and she suddenly says to me ""your grandmother on your mother's side is in the spirit world?"" I say yes and she says ""she wants me to let you know she's watching over you and the white feathers you see and find are her"" I had never told this lady what had happened that morning so how did she know about the feathers?! I feel comfort that my grandmother who I had such a special bond to is around me when times are tough."
t3_eu9njd,all_ads,Early childhood memory,Thetruthishere,"I have always wondered about this strange memory from early childhood. 

This was before my brother was born, making me under 3 and a half years old. 

My grandmother was babysitting me, I was laying down on some blankets on the living room floor for a nap while she laid on the couch. It was daytime. 

Next thing I know, it is night time and there’s a blinding white light coming from the other room. I got up to investigate, filled with fascination. 

I walked slowly toward it, feeling overwhelming peace, love, and wonder. In the bright light appeared the Virgin Mary. (Unknown at the time. Many years later I saw a painting and asked my grandmother who the lady was.)

None of my family ever went to church or were into any religion, so as I got older and started thinking about it, this struck me as a little weird. 

This is a memory that could have been a dream, but it always felt so tangible. 

I’m very interested to hear what thoughts anybody has on my experience. I’ve always been curious if anyone else has a memory like this as well."

Location- Kelowna BC Canada

 Date- July 10th 2018

 Upload description-  Me and my dad where fishing off a doc in Kelowna BC  and spotted something massive in the water. The thing looks like it is close in the video but it was a few hundred yards off shore and it was huge, I would say atleast 60 feet long you could visually see it rolling in the water. During this video there was a small group of people videoing off shore as well. Toward the end it goes into a small bay so me and my dad hopped in the truck and drove toward the area it was headed but when we got to the bay it was nowhere to be seen.

t3_eu3ro3,all_ads,Weird Experiences With Deja Vu,Thetruthishere,"I want to know what you guys think of this. This hasn't happened in a year or so and I never really figured out what was going on.

When I was younger I had very extreme cases of deja vu. There was the normal feeling of ""wait haven't I done this already,"" but then there are moments of overlapping deja vu. Basically I would get the normal feeling of repeating myself, then the feeling that I also had deja vu in the deja vu memory and so on. Sometimes this wasn't so bad, but other times it would repeat so many times that I would get a massive headache that forced me to just stop thinking for a while.

Weirder still, sometimes the deja vu moments were about things that I didn't think had happened yet. One I specifically remember happening when I got into a big fight with my parents over the psat in middle school, going into the bathroom to splash my face with water and thinking ""wtf this isn't even that important why is this happening."" Years later the exact same thing happened, but the argument was about potential colleges I could attend the next year. The deja vu feeling hit me and I immediately remembered the argument over the psat that I hadn't though of in years.

There is probably nothing too strange here, but I want to know what you think. Normal or something else?"
t3_etlyv0,all_ads,I had ayahuasca and the gore I needed to see was brutal...,Thetruthishere,"So I had ayahuasca, an indigenous medicinal and hallucinogenic brewing from the Amazon Forest, with a couple of friends here in Brazil and we usually stay lying down for most of the ceremonies. Some people stand up and dance, take walks but not this guy here.

The first time I went to one of those ceremonies, I felt nothing. The second time I was less nervous and the restlessness didn't catch up to my thinking so I was more relaxed.


Ah, the thing with this ceremony is we take 2 shots. One after you've acclimated to the place and once again when you're more comfortable, as we call, ""in the power"".


I felt nothing from the first shot so I asked the shaman if he could apply some rapé (medicinal powder from tree skins and roots to shoot up your nose so it hits you instantly) so I could focus on my own journey more still and more stable. She (they were a shaman couple) gave me some, I went back to my sleeping bag, and also had indigenous medicinal eye drops, called Sananga, and they feel like two burning and steaming hot metal rods deepening your eyeball. Seriously. The pain is SO intense that it's a known ""bad-trip"" killer in the indigenous communities.


Then my second shot.


That's when I see circles and triangles and then I saw some CRAZY shit. I couldn't remember what it was until next morning, 10am. The visions wore off, I came home, laid my head down on the pillow and... man... I just remembered it all.


What I had seen was a slave from probably 1800s (Brazil was the top slave trading country in the world, a lot of people's family tree is mixed with the African people) with his neck twisted and his face bloody. I think his chest was also slashed open but I couldn't bear to check.



Then I forgot about it again. That happens a lot with this medicine.


At night, at my gf's, I was getting ready to sleep when I remembered it again and told my gf about it, we started to theorize about it and, during my theorizing, with our closed in order to fall asleep while theorizing, I say ""maybe I killed this guy... [long pause] maybe this guy was my grandpa's dad or something...[long pause] maybe... maybe I was this guy...


Then all the flashes started again. The circles, the triangles, Sacred Geometry they call them. I remember his face very vividly while the circles didn't have a pattern...


I know there's no werewolf or vampires but this indigenous unknown made me feel deeply affected spiritually.


EDIT: wow thanks for the responses guys. Every single info is good for debate unless you're a self centered biatch like in some comments.


So after some redditors enlightened me on the topic, I found out that Sananga actually resets the energy field on the body, **if not making the trip even more intense**. Very bright redditors, thanks for the teachings. Stay tuned, February 22nd I'll go again and tell you guys what I saw.


EDIT 2: Also, Google some things about ayahuasca based religions in Brazil. [It's a big deal down here. ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314404973_Brazilian_Ayahuasca_Religions_in_Perspective) **AYAHUASCA IS 100% LEGAL IN BRAZIL.**"

t3_etocca,all_ads,I saw a willow wisp and didn’t realize it until retelling the story.,Thetruthishere,"I want to see if anyone can grasp what happened here. I was in the third grade playing around my house on the lake. I’m taking the branches off a willow tree and using the whips like Indiana Jones. I see this blue light floating nearby. It looked the way a light looks when you shine it through a crystal, but it was more condensed. It floated around and I followed it. Eventually I followed it to the lake where it descended into it. Never to be seen again. Me and my friends were talking about weird experiences so I told this. One friend says that since I was playing with a willow tree then it may have been a willow wisp trying to lure me into the lake. I don’t know much about the occult but if this matters, one day (can’t remember if before or after the light experiences) me and my brother found a goat head float up to our dock and our dad had to get it."
t3_etjvel,all_ads,That Time A Disembodied Face Smiled At Me,Thetruthishere,"Apart from major ups and downs, my life is pretty bland when it comes to the paranormal. I’ve always been attracted to ghost stories and creature sightings, even from a small age, so it’s no wonder that when it comes to things of a more ghostly nature, I feel a void. I always wondered why so many people would experience supernatural events, and yet I had nothing. Nothing ever happened to me that couldn’t be explained with “the house is old and broken.” That was until a night I spent sleeping alone in a granny flat at age 12.

For context, my parents hit the rocks and we ended up having to live in a caravan park. We were a large family of many children, so the park owners took pity on us and moved us to bigger and bigger caravans as they opened up until one of the granny flats became available, which as I’m writing this I realised may have been because someone died. The granny flats at the end of the park were usually reserved for the elderly who wanted a cheap place to spend their golden years, or less fortunately, for the childless, terminally ill seniors who need cheaper accommodation to pay for their medical expenses.

One of these terminally ill seniors was “Bob.” (Name changed not for privacy, but because I forgot. Sorry, Bob. Rest your weary soul.) Bob lived in the granny flat just in front of us, and my mother would frequently chat with him, which is how we learned of his cancer and upcoming chemotherapy treatments.

Anyways, I never felt creeped out by any of the caravans we’d been in so far, and nothing scary ever happened in them. The same went for the granny flat. In fact, I was charmed by the “little house” aesthetic that was going on. My siblings and I had fun exploring the two bedrooms, kitchen, living room, and very skinny bathroom. The bedroom which I greedily claimed as my own was the one with the bathroom attached. This is where the incident happened.

With so many kids, I rarely ended up sleeping on my own, even when my dad set up the bunk bed in the other room. There were just too many of us, no matter how much I insisted that it was MY room. However, there was one night when I finally did whine enough to get what I wanted, and my siblings all slept in the other room while my parents slept on the couch (I’m so sorry, I was such a huge brat when I was 12. Don’t hold it against me, though, it was due to childhood trauma. But yes, I also want to slap 12 year old me.) I stayed up late playing video games and finally decided I’d try to sleep at around 1AM.

I lay there with my eyes closed for what felt like 30 minutes, but was most likely 10. I wasn’t tired in the slightest, but knew if I opened my eyes I’d have to start all over again to get to sleep. Out of nowhere, a feeling of dread came over me, and I kept my eyes closed for good reason now. 

Y’all know the fight or flight response? Yeah, when I’m feeling dread, I choose freeze. 

This wasn’t the first time it happened. Frequently when I tried to sleep as a child a feeling of dread would suddenly loom over me, and I’d shut my eyes tightly for fear that if it knew I was awake, it would hurt me. I always feel a presence watching me when this happens, and it ain’t a good one. I always believed that if I continued to act as if everything was fine, even when I was awake, it would get bored and leave. I’d feel the dread, and then I’d “freeze”. I would continue to do what I was doing, be it sleeping, drawing, reading, but I wouldn’t change actions. I wouldn’t move in the bed, I wouldn’t lift my pencil, I wouldn’t flip the page. I would remain like a broken record until it went away.

I kept my eyes shut and tried to keep my breathing steady. Then my hair moved. It sort of but didn’t quite feel like fingers. It felt more like little bugs, like ants in my hair. It was like big ants or tarantula legs caressing my head. Or as if a person was touching my hair with their finger tips applying the lightest pressure. It was definitely too rhythmic to be a bug, too. It was in the same fashion as when someone strokes a cat. 

I was freaking out, but I wouldn’t let myself move no matter how much my body screamed at me to run. The “presence” of my childhood was trying bigger tactics to scare me, and I was having none of it. In my mind, if I let it scare me by touching me, then it would do it more often and to a greater extent, so I needed to show it I was unaffected. I did something truly brave to my 12 year old self. 

I turned around. 

I overcame my freezing to turn around to face the wall while resisting the urge to take off running. Surely this would show the presence that I wasn’t scared, I thought. It stopped stroking my hair, and nothing happened for a minute. I took this as an opportunity to calmly walk to where my siblings were sleeping and safely sleep there while loudly complaining about how cold it is. I opened my eyes to leave but was met with the grinning face of an old man.

The face was just, well, a face. It didn’t have a body. It didn’t even have a head. It was just the face of an old man that somewhat resembled Bob, but then again, all bald old men look the same. The face didn’t have colour, and the outlines of its features were green, like, the same kind of green glow that glow in the dark stars have. It almost looked like someone sketched a face on the wall with a glow in the dark pen. The face was slightly hovering. It blinked at me, and then it dissipated into little green particles. 

I couldn’t hold it together anymore, and I bolted to my siblings’ room and sat there on the bed pale faced. My mad dash awoke my mother, who asked me what was wrong. I explained what I saw, and at the time she didn’t believe me and told me I must have been dreaming.  I didn’t feel like arguing, so I just lay down and fell asleep among the spread out bodies of my little siblings. Sure, their legs were uncomfortable, but it was a hell of a lot better than being alone. I wondered if maybe I was being punished for being a brat, and I basically gave the ghost face a big “fuck you” when I proudly chose to sleep in that room alone the next night just to show it who’s really the boss here. Nothing happened, so maybe it gave up on me. As you can probably tell, I was one of those kids who saw punishment for my actions as a challenge of dominance. Sorry, Dad. 

Anyway, I have a couple of theories as to what happened that night.

Most plausibly my mother was right. I was dreaming. Sleep paralysis seemed like an explanation. Especially when you consider that I couldn’t move for some time. However, my inability to move seemed to me more of a conscious choice, and I did end up rolling over halfway through, so this most likely isn’t an explanation. 

Another theory I have is that the apparition I saw was Bob. He was at the hospital at the time, and whether he was dead or alive was unknown to me at the time, and this was one of the first things I thought of when I reflected on the event that night considering the ghost face didn’t hurt me, smiled at me, and stroked my hair. However, I later found out that Bob was, in fact, alive that night. So maybe it was the culmination of his energy? I don’t know.

Since someone most likely died there in that flat, I thought that perhaps it could be their ghost. This seems like the most fitting theory, however it doesn’t explain the feeling of dread in the beginning. I only recently saw the “dread” as a seperate entity which followed me, but it could also just be a side effect of ghosts presenting themselves throughout my life, so maybe paranormal events aren’t so shy to me after all. 

In the end, showing my fear didn’t make the “dread” worse. Nothing touched me after that, at least I don’t think so. I think there may have been a time where the dread or something stroked my cheek, but it was so brief it could have been my hair or the wind. The dread hasn’t visited me in a long time, but I’m less scared of it now, and more annoyed that it stops me from sleeping comfortably, so I’m mentally prepared for when it next decides to visit. I’m still very confused as to what happened that night, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter."

t3_etp7ox,all_ads,I think that I dreamt about the earthquake that hit Turkey,Thetruthishere,"As the title says. 

Since I was a little kid, I've always had pretty vivid dreams. So vivid that sometimes I can feel physical pain and also having the ability to read full pages or books, but after waking up I always shaked them up and didn't pay too much attention to them. 

A few nights ago I had a dream about a huge earthquake. I was dreaming about mundane things, as some of us do, but I remember having this feeling of dread. Before I knew, an earthquake started to hit. I never felt an earthquake before as I do not live near a seismic centre, yet my subconscious knew what it was. Also, my subconscious told me to go under a door frame, as I did, I remember yelling at other people to do the same, or to take cover and protect themselves, yet nobody paid attention to me. I remember that I even left the door frame in order to grab some of them under the door frame, but I was dismissed or ignored. 

Today, I was cleaning the house and the TV was on the news where I found out about the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey where almost 20 people died and more than 600 injured. (My thoughts goes to the families and victims affected by this tragedy) After hearing the news I started feeling shortness of breath and my heart started pounding.

I guess I should pay more attention to my dreams?

As a side note: since the beginning of the year, I've had this weird feeling. It feels like the feeling of an impending doom, the one you have when you're at the beginning of a panic attack, yet the panic attack never starts. I thought it was because of stress, but now, not so much. What are your thought? Am I the only one feeling like this?"
t3_et5546,all_ads,Experience With the Amish,Thetruthishere," I was born into an Amish society. People have them all mistaken. They are certainly not harmless people. They are in fact very dangerous to their own members. If you follow all their rules perfectly and never question what has been put in place, you'll do fine. However, if you even think about trying to step out the bubble, you will be faced with resistance. I never got my social security number or my birth certificate which has made it very tough for me. They also do very manipulative things such as frequent shunning as punishment and forced prayer. I tried to run away and was caught and forced to undergo a form of torture where they locked me in a dark room, somewhere where many people were, and had everyone knock on the walls and laugh. It was very traumatizing and cruel. I eventually escaped and am safe but I just want you guys to be aware of the truth..."
t3_etkl8k,all_ads,[Serious] A metaphysical book that recounts a 2-day stretch of telepathy and mediumship (PDF),Thetruthishere,"Hello everyone.

I offer a free new book that covers 2 days in 400 pages by refining the attentional and memory lapses into an *actual carnal continuum*. The body becomes both a spatial panorama and a temporal field distributing over activities of the panorama. We inhabit twin (complementary worlds): physical *spacetime* with 3 spatial dimensions, and mathematical *timespace* with 3 temporal dimensions. Spacetime is embedded in timespace in the same way the laws of physics are a subset of the (extended) laws of mathematics. Timespace contains the ""Heaven world"" or ""afterlife"" realm, as well as  so-called astral planes. Mental entities inhabit timespace, including a subset of our ancestors which have chosen to refrain from further incarnations in pursuit of other metaphysical functions. All anomalous, psychic, and paranormal phenomena amount to leakages or summonings of mental entities (thought-forms/tulpas) residing in timespace. I know these statements are nutty or unbelievable, but I implore your openness to these ideas and the book herein linked.

t3_etnsmn,all_ads,i felt an earthquake before everyone else in my city,Thetruthishere,"so i was on my last break during work today (it was only 15 minutes) when this happened, it was at 430pm. 

i work in a mall so i can pretty much go anywhere during my breaks and i decided to go to this japanese store on the first floor because i wanted candy. 

*a little background info: im pretty used to feeling the floor shake because i work on the second floor and its on a suspended ceiling which shakes when janitors move their carts or kids are jumping around

anyways, as soon as i walked in, i felt like i was on one of those spinning floors in a funhouse. it was a totally different feeling than i’m used to. i asked one of the employees and she just looked at me weird and said no. so i left after buying some candy and went to my friend’s store to say hi and ask if he knew what was up. i ended up taking to his coworkers and they felt NOTHING out of the ordinary

so i went back to work and was trying to figure out if any of my associates experienced it. nobody did. i thought my sugar just dropped really bad and dismissed it, until a few hours ago. 

turns out, there was an earthquake in my neighbor state at 3:03pm. aftershocks aren’t anything to write home about though. the weird part? the aftershock in my city occurred at 7:14pm. 3 hours after i felt it

i’m honestly not too sure if this qualifies as a premonition but it sure feels weird enough"
t3_etgz1z,all_ads,"“Hello, Why are you here?” and other tall tales",Thetruthishere,"Hi! So, recently I’ve bee hearing voices over different noises. You might be asking if I’m schizophrenic, but it’s only happened on my property. Here are a few examples:

Like the true stories I’ve written, I want to have some context; My family lives on a 5acre property. There is a large slope, down to a small park, and there is a gate. Now to the story:

When I was younger, My dad would call my name with his big booming voice, cause our property was so big. So he would call me with it, and I’d yell back. This one day, I was outside playing when I hear his loud booming voice “BAXTERISCUTE!” “YEAAH?” No response. 
I decided to see if my dad was home, so I checked the driveway, no car. At that moment, I remembered my dad was out in a meeting, so it was impossible for him to call me.

My second experience was when I was asked by my dad to get the lawnmower. I was dragging the lawnmower, and pulling it towards the driveway. That’s when I hear a voice of an old woman yell “HEY!” I turned around, thinking someone was there. Nope. I continued dragging it, when I hear it again “HEY!” It spooked me so much I dropped the gasoline can in my hand. I turn around and again, no one was there. I dragged it the last few feet, when I hear the voice mumbling and disappeared. 

Now, I stated this in my gnome story, but, my forest is abundent with voices. I can hear giggling sometimes, hear my name called behind me, etc. But this final story happened a few days ago. 

I was walking home from work, after taking the bus, when I walked to the gate in the park that leads to my 5acre property. I click the code, door opens. I close the door, and I hear “Hello, Why are you here?” I immediately bolted up my hill, not looking back. I knew I checked around the area prior to opening the gate, and no one was there. It spooked me the most, and I’m still afraid to walk home at night"
t3_etftjv,all_ads,"As a skeptic who wants to believe, can someone send me some links to clips/websites/documentaries that cannot easily be disproved?",Thetruthishere,Would be much appreciated!
t3_et6fgu,all_ads,Demons are Real,Thetruthishere,"So I'd like to start by saying this is all 100% true, no exaggerations or alterations hatsoever. Also, I apologize if this doesn't flow well, I'm far from an experienced writer but I'll do my best. 

When I was in high school, my best friend (let's call him Tyler) lived a few houses down from me. We hung out at each others houses frequently, spent a lot of our free time together. Both of had experienced different things I can only label as super natural or other-worldly, so much to the point that we would often tell each other things that had happened to us growing up or recently. Things like seeing people that shouldn't be some where, items around the house moving with no logical expliantion, hearing things or voices when we're alone, etc. Typical things for people who are tuned in to those sorts of things. 

Well, Tyler's house for some reason seemed to be a hot spot for these occurrences, as well as our neighborhood in general. Where we were used to be a huge farm land close to a century ago, in fact there's still a barn left on one of the properties. At some point, there was a fire in the barn that killed a couple people. I didn't know about that until after I was said barn on fire and could hear screams coming from it. I went to get an adult (I would have been around 10, maybe 11) and when I turned back around the barn was back to normal, no sign of smoke, people, anything. A week after was when I learned there had been a fire there.

Anyways, I'm getting side tracked. At Tyler's house, doors would open and close themselves, showers would turn themselves on, lights turning on or off, random items dropping off of counters or shelves. Things like this happened so much that even his skeptic family acknowledged it happened but they never really said or thought anything about it. If they did, they never mentioned it. Tyler and I always felt as though whatever was causing everything lived in the basement, which sucked because after his older sister moved out for college, he moved into her room down there. 

One summer night, Tyler and I were in his back yard having a bon fire, just hanging out and talking. We started it about an hour before sunset. All was normal, we were talking and joking and laughing. We had to keep quiet because his dad had to wake up practically in the middle of the night for work and his window faced the back yard where we were. When the sun had just set on the horizon, we noticed someone in their kitchen window. We didn't give it a second thought, assuming it was his dad getting water from the sink. Neither of us said anything to the other but we knew each other had seen him. A few minutes later, we see 'his dad' in the French doors to the back deck staring at us. At this point, one of us said something about how it was weird he was awake. That's when we looked closer and noticed that we couldn't make out any features other than a basic outline of a male adult, around 6'3 or so. We then realized that it definitely was not his dad. As I mentioned earlier, things like this were not abnormal for either of us. We silently agreed to ignore it so it would leave us alone. We've seen what happens when you acknowledge them. A few minutes later, the figure is gone.

About 5 minutes later, we hear what sounds like footsteps walking behind us, and I don't know about him but all the hair on my body stood up straight. We both knew what it was since it couldn't possibly be a person. There was 1 gate to the back yard and we were facing at it, and we would have also seen/heard someone coming from the French doors on the deck. Again, we agreed not to acknowledge it. It would go away we thought. And that might have been true, but that's not what happened. 

I don't know if I would call myself a full empath, but I am very sensitive to people's emotions that I am near. Out of no where, I feel someone else's anger. Rage like I had never felt before, the only word I could use for it would be hatred. I looked at Tyler to see if it was coming from him or if he felt it too, and he did. When I looked at him, he told me ""Ignore it. Don't talk about it."" I tried to do just that, and did for about 30 seconds, when we both heard the footsteps moving from behind me to behind him, maybe 20 feet away. After that, we heard them walking from behind him back to behind me, this time 10 feet away if even that. This is when I started to feel sick to my stomach and nervous. I was afraid it would hurt us or taunt us some how. 

I did my best to ignore it, but then I looked back at the fire. In the corner of my eye, I saw the figure from the window again, but this time in the yard with us, about 15 feet away from me near the corner of the fence, just standing there, not moving one bit. I got Tyler to look too and he said he knew and that it was okay. He was trying to keep me calm, I guess hoping it would just leave. I shut my eyes and tried to slow my heart. That's when we heard a sigh, practically in the middle of us. At that, I jumped up from my seat and started yelling. I said go away, leave us alone, we don't want you hear. Tears were welling up in my eyes. Tyler stood from his chair and grabbed me. He guided me inside the house and we went down to his room in the basement. I told him that I was so scared because I knew that that.. thing, wanted to hurt him, and I knew that at the moment at least, it absolutely had the ability to. I didn't know how, but I have no doubt it would have been severe, if not permanent. 

Earlier that day, before we went to his house, my parents told me I couldn't stay at his house that night because we had church in the morning. I was never one to break a rule, talk back, or pick an argument with my parents. They always treated me with respect so I did the same to them, but with everything that happened upon how certain I was that this thing was going to hurt him, I called one of my dad and told him to get my mom on the line. I told them something close to this ""I'm sorry but I'm not coming home tonight. There is something here with us and it is angry, it hates Tyler and it is going to hurt him if I don't stay with him. I'll make sure I'm up and ready in time for church but I am not leaving him tonight."" 

My dad fought me on in for a minute, which I anticipated, but that's why I asked him to get my mom on the phone too. Whatever ability it was that Tyler and I have, my mom had it too but 10X stronger. She was tormented with visits as a kid and as an adult she's had dozens of spirits come to her for help. Point is, I knew she would understand. And she did, she helped me convince my dad it was okay for me to stay with Tyler. 

I know this whole story is a mess and I apologize, I might go back and edit it to make it flow as best as I can, I'm typing this all on my phone right now.

I hope at least some of you trust this is true. I actually started to tear up a bit just writing this, remembering hoe terrified I was. The only things that compare to how scared I was would be when my dad had a heart attack, my mom's stroke, or my brothers seizure (yes we all have some pretty bad health issues lol)

If anyone liked reading this, please let me know in the comments, or if you have any suggestions I'm open to improving. I have dozens of stories that I would love to share if anyone is interested. Thanks for reading!"
t3_et1okh,all_ads,Lifetime of Paranormal Experiences,Thetruthishere," 

1988,  3am, alone except for my dog, and sound  asleep. I hear three very loud  knocks on my door which was right next to my bed. I woke up and bounded  to the door in three steps. My dog was already at the door in alert  mode and listening. I looked out the peep hole in the door expecting to  see a cop. Nothing there. Then I realized that my door is inside a gated  court yard with 6 ft  high brick walls and the gate was locked. No one  could have run off without being seen or heard climbing the gate.

2005,  4am, 22 year old son is home from college, and I am awakened by three  loud knocks. The sound seemed to come from all directions at once. I got  up and checked out the house.  Nothing. Later that morning my son gets  up and says ""did you hear the three knocks last night?"" I said ""yes, it  is the second time that I have heard knocks around 3am.""  I consulted a  respected psychic and she said that it was grandpa checking on you and  that he looks like you.""

My mother  died in 2011. In 2014 I dreamed that I saw her face against a  black  background and she says ""you are going to need a bigger patio"". I woke  up and said to myself wow that seemed real and went about my day  thinking about the experience. Two weeks later, my son calls me and asks  if he can store some weight lifting equipment at my house. I said OK  and he said he was on his way. He arrived with two friends in a large  flatbed truck loaded with equipment. They unloaded the equipment onto my  back patio completely covering it. I watched as they filled the last  remaining space on the patio and I remembered the dream and instantly  understood its meaning. My mom just let me know that she still exists.

Age  10, its summer and I am home alone around 6pm watching TV. A stack of  books on a shelf above by bed shot off the shelf and landed in the  middle of my bedroom.

1968. 2am. I  can't sleep and don't want to disturb my  wife. So I go sit on the  couch in the front room in the dark. The couch faces a fireplace with a  TV in front of it.  So I am looking in the direction of the TV. Behind  me is the doorway into the hallway which leads to a bathroom to the left  and our bedroom to the right. As I am sitting there in darkness I  notice movement of a reflection on the black TV screen. I focused on the  movement and it looks like the reflection of a  woman dressed in a  white gown moving left and right in the dark hallway door opening. Just  back and forth towards the bathroom and then towards the bedroom. I  watched this for about a half hour and would look in the hallway and see  nothing, but when I looked back at the TV there was the white  apparition floating back and forth. I got bored and went back to bed.

2014.   I am babysitting my 4 year old granddaughter. She has a DVD with old  Disney Christmas shows she wants to watch. One of the old shows from  1953 comes on and there is an old fashion band playing.  My  granddaughter says ""I used to watch this with all of my cousins."" This  went on for weeks and I didn't say anything. Her mom told me that my  granddaughter also said the same thing at her other grandparents house.  Finally,  the next time it came up I said to my granddaughter ""you only  have one cousin"" My granddaughter replied that she did have more  cousins. So I said ""where are they?"" She looked at me and pointed her  index finger up at the ceiling. I said ""why are they here?""  She replied  ""they protect me. They keep me safe""  I said ""why can't I see them"".  She replied ""they are hiding"".

Maternal  great grandmother told me this story about my mom during WW2 when my  dad was in the Army Air Corps. With the war on, my mom lived with and  shared a bedroom with her grandmother. One night my grandmother said  that my mom sat up in bed and said ""Oh my god his airplane just broke in  half and is going down"".  Some days after my moms vision,  my dad  called my mom and told her that was on a training flight in a Lockheed  Hudson bomber over Georgia. He was in the tail of the airplane when the  tail broke off. He was able to parachute safely, but he rest of the crew  in the front of airplane couldn't get out and died.

1956.  Both of my maternal grandparents died in October 1956 when I was about 8  years old. Months later I am at school.  The bell for recess rings and I  skip playing with my friends and instead walk out to the farthest  extent of the playground to an old baseball diamond. I am just hanging  out playing with the chain link fence around the dugout. The bell rings  to end recess and I ignore it. A few minutes passed while I just  continued ignoring that it was time to return to class.  At that moment I  heard my grandfathers deep low voice  as loud and clear as if he were  right next to me, say  ""you better go in son""."
t3_eth9po,all_ads,The Man in the White Suite,Thetruthishere,"When I was two years old my uncle passed away from carbon monoxide poisoning working for Stanley Steamer. 

I had no idea what death was, as I was a toddler. My parents never told me about it and therefore I had no clue. 

The night he died, my room filled up with daylight, my backyard was transformed into a big backyard with rolling hills and a red barn off in the distance(I lived in an apartment) and there was a golden ladder outside of my window shooting up as far as the eye could see. 

Then my uncle Chad appeared in less than an instant. On the ladder. 

He was in a white suit and black shiny shoes and had this golden glow around him. Something was so serene about it.

He told me everything was alright and to tell my mom that everything was fine and proceeded to tell me to look at how beautiful it was but at that point I couldn’t see anything but him. 

My mom said she walked in the room because she heard me talking and I was looking out the window into the night sky just saying Jesus over and over again. 

I wasn’t raised religious. Had never been to church. We still talk about it to this day like all the time trying to make sense of it."
t3_eso5vd,all_ads,Can we lay off the click bait titles?,Thetruthishere,"IT CAME BACK TONIGHT...

This isn’t fucking buzzfeed. This is a sub for people who are already into the subject. You don’t need to sell us, especially not in a style that immediately casts doubt on the veracity of your story.

t3_et45lg,all_ads,Lights over California desert in 2004,Thetruthishere,"Frequent reader. First time poster. In 2004, when I was 14 living in Phoenix, Arizona, my family was going through a rough time. My mom left my stepdad for a new guy and I went to live with my grandparents for the summer. My grandpa could see I was a bit depressed so he packed up the car and took me and my cousins on a trip to Disneyland. We had a great time and I made memories I’ll never forget. On the way back though, I saw something that has never quite sat right with me.

As I type this, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. We were somewhere between Anaheim, CA and Phoenix, AZ (but on the CA side of the border) late at night when, over the mountain range I noticed a huge bright blinding light. It was as bright as a few football fields is the only way I can describe it but way too high to be lights on the ground. The mountains were super high so it had to be in the air. It definitely wasn’t a plane because it was too bright. The oddest part of it all was that it was completely motionless. I can’t remember any sort of formation to the light, just that it was so so so bright. 

It must have been suspended there for maybe two to five minutes? It wasn’t a long time but long enough for me to stare at it for a bit. As the road turned, the mountain came between us and the lights. Then suddenly, they turned off and there was only darkness. 

I kept asking my grandpa “did you see it? Did you see it?” As a joke, he pretended to be possessed by something and talked in a scary voice. Then he laughed and my cousins did too. They didn’t talk again and it was almost like they didn’t really consider it significant. My family is a bit, I guess simple? They’re not big critical thinkers. I’ve tried to bring it up over the years but they brush it off. 

I’ve done a lot of research and I see stuff about military planes and the Phoenix lights but it didn’t really look like any of that. Any ideas? I have goosebumps everywhere typing this."
t3_et6smg,all_ads,An incident I had 5 years ago.,Thetruthishere,"To start in a typical fashion, I don't really believe in this stuff. I would like to, and I have had small, strange incidents throughout my life that can possibly be explained, but ultimately are a little beyond the norm. I grew up in rural Ireland, and I think in my teens the idea of the supernatural simply excited me. Being surrounded by old farmers with their strange folk tales, and even members of my family who held defiant stances against the paranormal world, but had inexplicably experienced strange things, I grew up with an eager attention towards these things, but definitely do not hold any strong beliefs. 

Either way, I have experienced some weird things that may interest some of you, and I intend to write a few of them up. Just because. 

This particular situation is just what happened, I'm implying nothing nor making any assumptions/ conclusions. Just writing it up as it happened. 

About 5 years back, I lived with my father in the UK over summer while awaiting my uni to start again in September. It was a relatively newish house in a nice residential area of a large town. The house was at the top of a hill and nearby was a small graveyard. I had my PC set up in our dining room, on the table placed so I had my back facing the large bay window. That night my father was away somewhere and it was just me and my step mother at home. At this point she was in bed and it was quite late, definitely after midnight. I got a text that he would be back in around an hour/ two hours time.

Despite knowing he was coming home later, while just browsing stuff I heard a tap on the window. I instantly assumed it was my father having returned super early. I turned round and couldn't see anyone but this didn't shake the idea that he must have been home and wanted me to open the door for him. Bare in mind this was the back of the house, so in the adjoining kitchen there was a back door, only about 5 foot away from the edge of the bay windows, so it made sense for him to be tapping on the window. 

I get up, go to the kitchen, open the door and find no-one there. I figured ""oh well, strange occurrence"" and shrugged it off. It was a nice night though, so I just stood in the doorway for a minute and looked at the stars. It was only a minute, but suddenly, exactly where I was looking, I saw a weird shape flash across the sky. It was like a shooting star but it very rapidly sped in the same shape a heartbeat monitor makes when it blips up and down, only from right to left instead. As in it travelled in a line from the right, shot up, then directly down, then back up halfway and off again in a straight line. I felt like I watched it move but it went so fast that I basically saw the whole shape in one instance. It was about as long as your finger would cover at arm's length. Again I just thought it was weird. Immediately after, I heard stuff move on the kitchen counter directly behind me. In fact, it made the exact noise of the kettle being placed on its base. So similarly that I just 100% believed my step mother had woken and was putting the kettle on. I spoke to greet her and turned around, only to find the room empty and still.

I thought it was weird, but I left things alone and went back to my PC. The night ended normally.

Now the next bit is hard to describe effectively, and in my opinion is both more explicable but understandably hard to believe. It may also be totally unrelated to the first half of this story. Over the next 2-3 weeks I was harassed by a tiny shape. I remember it starting almost immediately after that night, but in no way can remember specific time frames. We had a piano in that same dining room, and in the middle of the day I was sat playing it. While playing it, I started seeing this little shadow, about 5-6 inches tall, dart behind things. For instance, I would see it in my peripheral hide behind my leg. Or I would be looking at the piano and notice it move behind a picture frame on top. It did not stay exclusively in my peripheral, it would sometimes move around quite close to the center of my vision, but just in areas I wasn't directly focusing on. It wouldn't move across large stretches at first either, more just I would notice it quickly hide behind things as if it had been peeking out and I hadn't previously noticed it. 

I remember while playing the piano this first time, over this 10 minute window it happened over and over to the point where I became really frustrated and tense. It wasn't frightening at all but so frustrating that it began stressing me out. 

This happened as I said for about 3 weeks. In this time I also moved out of my father's house and into my new student house. I was happy to be back with my friends in a free environment, but was still kept on edge by this constant shadow. I didn't mention it to anyone for the duration it happened for. It escalated at one point to where I would be sitting in a room and see it fly around the ceiling and hide behind lightshades like a bat flitting about. In the few times I clearly remember seeing it, I was alone, although it may have happened a few times with other people in the room. 

And then just as it started, it suddenly stopped. And that was it. I was left alone. 

I accepted it and moved on.

And that's the first of my potential incidents. Sorry for length but I didn't want to split these two instances up, as I generally consider them as one incident. I know of people who experience stress through weird visual hallucinations. I suppose it could have been this, although I don't remember being stressed at that time, nor for that long a period, and have never experienced anything similar."
t3_et4o6d,all_ads,Do you feel the same way?,Thetruthishere,"Alright its hard for me to write this down since I dont want to sound like a lunatic.. but do you guys feel like things are shifting?

I feel like and had more than enough encounters of paranomal stuff that has happened to me and a small group of friends that believe in the supernatural. Those incidents become more and more apparent and seem to happen more often. 

I‘d like to consider myself as a spiritual sensitive person and the group I was mentioning as well. We gathered over years experiences and pretty much can explain most of whats happening to each other. But we all had, without mentioning it before, the same thought one night together. We all came to the conclusion that it seems like the spiritual world/realm is shifting more and more into the one we live in. Darkness is way more obvious than ever. Dark entities and harmful behavior from said beings started to happen and more frequently.
I‘d like to mention that none of us is doing black magic, not even tarot - nothing. We learned our lesson years ago and learned to handle the consequences. Not that any of us invoked something.

Something else to mention - people around me, out of that friend group, that I consider friends as well seem to have a spiritual awakening. Had two examples within a week and it kind of shocked me.

Theres so much stuff that happened here but too much to describe here. In the end I just wanted to hear you opinion on our theory."
t3_et4ja0,all_ads,Twice in one night,Thetruthishere,"When I was around 16-17, after leaving my grandmother's home one night, my aunt, two cousins, my dad and myself were all on our way back to my aunt's house (dad and I stayed with her at the time). On our way home, we drove the an apparition that seemed to have look like a man. My aunt thought we were about to run someone over, and so did my dad but we drove straight through. Really weird. 

We finally get home. We had these really tall windows and curtains on them. We're at the door, and in the window closest to the door (like two feet away), we see two eyes look from the bottom into our direction. We thought it was my dog, Rosco but when we opened the door there was no one there. My dog had actually been in the room with my other cousin who had stayed home and the door to the room was closed. Pretty creepy.

Probably not super scary stuff but it was weird af to me."
t3_et5p20,all_ads,"Screeching Noise at night, mechanical, repetitive and it makes me paranoid",Thetruthishere,"hello, I don't really post a lot on reddit but there's been this noise I've been hearing for awhile. 

Background: I just recently moved to Wisconsin from Texas for an education. I've been here for about 6 months, and me and my girlfriend have heard this sound late at night. 

It sounds like a tire screeching sound, except everytime we hear it it's the same sound. It's high pitched and it's an ascending and it lasts about a second or two. It echoes a bit afterwards, and it's so loud. Normally if a tire is screeching it's not so loud to be heard in a place where there are not that many cars. When me and my girlfriend are out at night it's very late, where there are no cars. I've heard it over a dozen times, but for some reason this sound makes me paranoid and dissociative.  I have heard it before in Texas, but not as often as I hear it here. 

I know for a fact it's not an animal because it sounds almost mechanical and I've listened to about every animal that makes late at night sounds and they don't match at all. (But I am still open for suggestions, it's not a fox, it's not Bigfoot, and it's not the screeching owl either) Secondly, I live in a downtown inner city area where there is little to no forest, or animals for that matter. Yet I still hear this noise. 

If you know of this noise, or perhaps it's whereabouts please let me know. This sound brings me a lot of anxiety, paranoia and sends me into a dissociative state if I think about it too much. But I need to know if other people hear this outside of Wisconsin (my roommates and their friends have also heard this sound.) 

Thank you for reading, I only found one subreddit about a noise similar and it's like 7 years old. Trusting yall, please help!"
t3_eszs65,all_ads,i keep seeing the number 413,Thetruthishere,"this isnt really a conspiracy and more of a spiritual thing but for the last maybe 2 years i see the number 413 every day or every other day and sometimes i’ll go up to 2 weeks without seeing it. mostly my eyes will shoot to a clock or my phone clock or a street number or just random numbers somewhere. i kinda like to think theres a force watching over me trying to protect me. it brings me comfort :,)"

t3_esgbqm,all_ads,Stick Figure Creature,Thetruthishere,"So this experience occurred in the summer of 2016 honestly I’m not sure what month. This happened in Minnesota. This is my first time telling this story to anyone. I haven’t talked about it with anybody other than my fiancé who is now my wife as we were on a walk when it occurred. 

The summer of 2016 I was interning at a church in the small city of Mound Minnesota. The city is out on Lake Minnetonka basically. Sometimes my wife would ride out with me if I needed to pick something up or get something done. This particular evening I had to do something at the church quick so we ran out there. Afterwards we decided to go on a walk. 

Now I don’t remember exactly the road we were on but I do vaguely. It was between the church and by Dutch Lake I’m fairly sure. We parked and got out of the car. There weren’t many houses on this road. There was an older farmhouse with a barn up ahead of where we parked and then what looked like a couple long driveways. The time was somewhere between 7:30 and 9pm. We locked the car and started walking and talking. After about 3 minutes or so we were up at the farmhouse. 

This is where my wife saw something. In the middle of a sentence she stopped. And I took a couple steps ahead. Then she asked me if I saw that with urgency. I turn my head to the yard in front of the farmhouse. What I saw was a stick figure looking thing. About 2 feet tall with arms and legs about 1 foot long. No features at all. It was a cloudy black color striding across the yard smoothly. It started on the ground from where I saw it and as it went it gradually rose to be about 1-2 feet off the ground still striding in the air. Then it just disappeared in front of our eyes as if it went through a portal or something like that. In talking later on we figured from where she first spotted it traveled 50 feet give or take. 

As soon as it disappeared I told her we need to get out of here. We felt this overwhelming sense of fear overcome us. We booked it to the car. I whipped a u turn and we got out of there as fast as we could. We sat in silence for a good long time before we talked about what we saw on the way home. 

When one of us brings it up now we are both uneasy to talk about it being the strong sense of fear that overcame us. I know the land around Lake Minnetonka and the lake itself has been inhabited for thousands of years by mound builders and then later on the Mdewakanton tribe who are a sub tribe of the Isanti Dakota so maybe this thing we saw has relation to these peoples. I’m not sure honestly. If anybody has any info or theories as to what we saw or what it could be I would love to hear them. I’ve attached a [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/neV98Ec) to a rough map and sketch of the creature and area."
t3_ess4c2,all_ads,Past Life Regression Experience ✨👽,Thetruthishere,"Recently got a past life regression experience and discovered that I apparently have some alien origins to my soul! I always add a dash of discernment with these kind of things but the whole experience was super cool so I thought I would share for anyone who is interested. She basically takes you into a theta state which is very trance like and relaxed. I was guided into my childhood memories and then going all the way back to out of my body and finding myself in the body of my former self. I’ve always been super esoteric and out there so it wasn’t that surprising to find myself residing on another planet. She asked a whole ton of questions. A lot of the information just channeled through easily and I was able to answer everything. For some reason, some things were blocked but other than that I found the whole experience to be very eye opening. Sharing the message that we are not our bodies ultimately. if anyone is interested, I created a video on my entire experience. It’s worth it to check it out. It’s a full detailed report of the entire experience and all the information that was channeled through me! I put the link here: [Past Life Regression Experience 👾✨](https://youtu.be/dPwlbW5HEBg)"
t3_esp01n,all_ads,My Childhood Experiences With Strange Things,Thetruthishere,"Edit: this is a long post, just to warn you ahead of time. 

When I was around kindergarten age, I had a lot of nightmares that affected me deeply. Some were kind of silly (Gossamer from the Loony Toons killed my family) or creepy on their own (Chased by a possessed knife-wielding featureless wooden doll) but I think the strange experiences I had as a child started with this one: 

It was a dark house at night. The house was really nice, but “subdivision-nice”, if that makes sense. I was walking along balcony when I saw footprints in the carpet downstairs. Then at the end of the upstairs hallway, another staircase descended into darkness, and two pairs of  glowing eyes stared at me, floating.

Ever since then, I had a recurring dream. In every new house I moved into, I had been attacked by a disembodied voice as soon as I realized something was wrong in the dream; for example, in high school, I had a dream where the rod that hung from the blinds in my bedroom wouldn’t stop swinging from side to side, even when I tried to hold it still. At some point while doing this, a violent, angry shout would always assail me from behind, sometimes chasing me across the house or out of the house entirely. It was an older man’s voice, and it was rough and guttural. There was never really a timeframe as to when I would have it, but I knew at some point, whenever I moved, that it would happen, and it would only happen once as long as I stayed there. 

Once, when I was about in the third or fourth grade, I awoke to strange noises. I heard people talking, I thought. It sounded like a room full of people talking quietly in low tones - almost like chanting - but I couldn’t make out what any of them were saying. I tried rationalizing it by concluding that my stepmom’s cats had turned on the radio in the living room, which had happened before, so I got up. I was thirsty and wanted water, but I was nervous and pacing around the room when I looked out of my bedroom windows and I saw beams or something - it looked kind of like bars across the windows, but dull and hard to see. After a couple minutes of being in my room and trying to get up the courage to go to get water, the voices hadn’t stopped. I wanted to see if the radio was on, and then turn it off, so I finally stepped through the threshold of my bedroom, then a demonic, unnatural scream/screech came towards me from the ceiling. It was almost metallic in how sharp it was, but it was also organic. I immediately ran across the hall to my parents’ room and slept in their bed, too frightened to be alone. This experience was fairly different than the dreams I was used to having, but it seems like it was possibly related somehow. I learned some time later that the previous owner of them home had imprisoned her son in the basement until her death. The malevolent nature of the house may explain why I experienced the “dream” so intensely and in a conscious state, even. 

In the eighth grade after our winter formal, I found myself lying on the floor of my bedroom with the lights on, staring at the ceiling. I had not had a good night (awkward teenage romance woes) and wanted to just kind of brood, as angsty teens do. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them, a dark shadow silhouette was leaning over me. It was gone in an instant, but I could have sworn that it must have been “him.” 

Sometime later in the same house, I saw a gently floating wisp of white light/smoke - while I was peeing in my bathroom, of all places. It floated up from behind the toilet, crossed in front of my face, and towards the doorway, fading out as it moved away. This experience WAS completely unrelated to the invisible man, as I felt at peace around the being. 

When I turned 18 everything changed. I had a different dream, this time. I was paralyzed, lying on the floor on an inflatable mattress in my apartment in Utah, when someone kicked in the back door. I was under a blanket, unable to see, and every time I tried to move, it felt like electricity shooting through my body. Heavy boot steps approached where I was. I was terrified. But instead of attacking me, this time the invisible man stood over me and tore a sheet of paper into pieces, letting them fall into my unmoving hands. My blanket was covering my eyes, but it felt like he was saying goodbye. 

It’s been 8 or 9 years now and I haven’t heard from”him” since, nor have I had any other strange things happen. Sometimes I wish the paranormal would return to my life, but I’m also kind of glad it’s gone. At the very least, those experiences have made me a good campfire storyteller."
t3_eswiod,all_ads,The thoughts of God,Thetruthishere,"Imagine what it would be like having the abilities of an omnipresent omnipotent God. The only God in existence, one person or one being. What would you do with your time and abilities? It's almost impossible to think outside of your current situation. Time wouldn't be an option for you because you could experience anything anywhere. Any world anything you can imagine is brought into the instance of your being. An alien world full of beings made from fish? A world entirely by yourself, with animals and weird plants around you. Anything you can imagine is there.

Being this powerful being you attempt to do something new. You've been doing everything from falling in love, sexual pleasures, and many more things. Being such a powerful being, anything was in grasp.  After a while, you begin to become bored after experiencing everything, because boredom is the opposite of creativity.

You begin to think of a brilliant idea of ""forgetting who you are"". What I mean by this, is think of dying, going to sleep, or being born. So, what you do is you get ready and create a button that says ""Suprise me"" and slam that button-down as fast as you can. Then bam, you've instantly teleported anywhere in the possibility of your imagination which is infinite.

Now, in just a blink of an eye everything you knew and thought you were disappeared. You slowly open your eyes for the first time and see yourself here reading this post wondering what the hell did you do this for? Well, it's all for the ride and the experience. The ability to not know what is coming around the corner, because if you could do that the future would already be the past.

Anything is possible and that is why we are here right now. Don't let yourself put yourself down, because you are the world that you live in."
t3_esoe28,all_ads,The Dog,Thetruthishere,"Hi all. I know it’s been a while since I’ve posted. A lot has happened. Ever since I shared those two stories about my families encounters with skinwalkers i have felt... hunted. For lack of a better term. I’ve felt watched and it’s been bothering me for a while. 

The thing that’s been happening is on a pretty notorious road in my town. This road has had numerous murders and ghost sightings on it and is genuinely creepy at night. Not to mention that there’s a horse ranch on it that the owners dropped like flies and their “prize winning” horses mysteriously died on. 

My main interaction here lately happened right near this ranch. I was driving home from school and I take night classes so it was pretty dark. I drive a shitty old Taurus that has an issue every other week but I’m poor so any car is good. Anyways I was driving and my car started to over heat and started acting up. The hiccuping was so bad I decided to pull over the next spot I can. This road is very curvy and there’s only one straight way (right in front of the ranch, go figure).

I pulled off and called my gfs uncle who works on cars and he said he would be there in about 30 minutes. “No big deal” I thought “ I’ll wait in the car” however my cars heat is broke and it was colder in there than outside so I decided to wait on the hood of my car. I sat opposite the iron gate that was the entrance to the ranch. The entrance goes out into two small fields where they would showcase their horses (the last one to die was a celebrity named Duke) the fields end with a small forest and road going through to the main house. 

Ever since the first horse and person deaths came out there was rumors that the place was haunted. They were of course “natural” at least the people’s were to some degree. The horses were slaughtered by a “bear” very doubtful but that’s what was said. I never stepped foot near the place before and wasn’t planning on it. But as I sat down on the hood of my car browsing Reddit I heard something in the field. When I shined my flashlight to see what it was my heart dropped. 

It looked like a pale skinny “dog” I guess. It looked wrong. I freaked out and got in my car and it seemed to run at me. I got in and looked and didn’t see it. Of course I’m not an idiot and decided not to get tour and look but to just sit calmly in my car. I heard a growl somewhere near me and gtfo’d. I turned my car in and high tailed it out of there. I of course fucked my car up doing so but as soon as I got out of the woods I pulled over and waited. 

It’s been about 4 days and when I drive that road I still see a pale shape in the dark and it fills me with fear. A couple of other things have been happening too. My aunt has taken a sharp turn and got very very sick and if my cousins are to be believed it may be something very evil that did it. But that’s a very different story that’ll be difficult to tell so I’ll save it for a different time.

TL;DR: my car broke down and I saw a pale humanoid thing that chased me."
t3_esn7o4,all_ads,Hat man/ shadow people - ongoing feeling of fear and dread?,Thetruthishere,"Sorry about formatting, on mobile. 


So I came across a post about shadow people earlier and it brought me here. This is a bit hard to explain but I’m wondering how you feel when you think back to when you seen the hat man or shadow people?


I have numerous experiences with shadow people, more times than most it’s specifically the hat man. 6ft, long trench coat, fedora, no distinguishing features. The first time I seen him (around 8 years ago) I had no idea what it was, I had no interest in the paranormal, but after about 4 visits I start googling things along the lines of “seeing man wearing fedora” etc and I found out I wasn’t the only one seeing the so called hat man. 



I could talk about my “run ins” with the hat man and shadow people all day because I’ve had so many, so I’m happy to answer any questions. 



However what I was wondering was, anyone who’s seen him/them, do you get the same sense of dread you had in the moment when you think back?



Basically my experiences have drastically decreased recently, and I think about the shadow men at lot less than I used to, however when I’m reminded, such as when I read the post earlier, I’m overcome with fear and dread, and I tear up. It’s strange because I don’t even really have reactions like that when I’m metres away from the hat man. But if I think back, or I tell someone about it I can literally feel the fear in my body. Does anyone else feel this way?"
t3_esmper,all_ads,Shadow Man,Thetruthishere,"Just so you guys know its gonna be a short story. This happened to me back when i was about 7 or 8 (im currently turning 21 soon). I was at my house after school with my friend at the time, we were olaying with some dolls i had. Being the nosey kids we were, and since my mom ran a daycare (it was parent pickup time) we ran to go eavesdrop on the conversations, as we walked down my hallway i felt really uneasy (i had since i had gotten home but this felt heavy, like dread) to i had my friend stop and i turned around and all i see is this shadow of a man, top hat (fedora like), trench coat, no facial features, literally like a shadow, jump into the wall that lead to my room. I swung back around scared and said to my friend ""i think i just saw a ghost, she wide eyed said ""I believe you"" not sure if she also saw it but that whole night i kept hearing my name whispered. I have more weird stories about that house if y'all wanna hear more please let me know."
t3_eso47k,all_ads,Questioning my sanity,Thetruthishere,"So, im not sure where to start this off.

I used to live in a pretty old house, and i've always been sure there where more things there, along with some things that happened. (I will write about these later on when i feel a bit more confident)

The point is, i got a ton of memories about everything that happened, but lately as i stopped experiencing things, i actually doubt my memories and sanity. Like, it all seems so unreal, like a little TOO much. but on the other side i believe its all true, it all happened.

So as you all may understand, im kinda torn because of this, and actually trying to figure out if it all may actually be true.

So, please share any opinions, stories, experiences or whatever that may help. Idc if its in the comments or in private if you dont feel comfortable sharing in public."
t3_esgzv5,all_ads,Weird Experience/Dream,Thetruthishere,"When I was little, we lived in this apartment in Toronto, the windows facing another apartment. I have a vivid memory of a dream (I think, hopefully) that I looked out the window and saw a round, colourful, planet looking thing up in the sky and the sky was purple, in that vision/dream my balcony had stairs that were locked by a padlocked (I remember this vividly), even though they don't irl. The next day, (maybe a different dream?) there were people dressed in black all over our balcony, and I remember telling my mom about them and she just brushed me off. I have remembered different variations of this such as the ball (planet?) rushing towards the earth, but don't remember anything after that. 

I'm wondering if I have changed realities/dimensions/universes multiple times and if those events are real of a dream. If they were a dream, I have no idea how I could've thought up something like that at that small age as I never watched movies or read books about paranormal things or planets when I was little. I asked my mom about this before but she doesn't remember anything and brushed it off as a dream, but I am still wondering what really happened."
t3_erxdhe,all_ads,The Humans died long ago.,Thetruthishere,"TL;DR included.  Disclosure: just an entertaining idea.. \*\*Laughs in Vatican Secret Archive \*\*

Many know the story of [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve), the first HUMANS to be created. Adam and Eve were told by god that they cannot eat from [The Tree of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil). If they were to eat from the tree, ""They are doomed to die."" As the story goes, [Lucifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer)(The deceiver) tricked Eve into eating from the tree, KNOWING that it will condemn them to their demise.

Inside the garden of eden, lucifer could not take action. He needed adam and eve to be cast out in order for his plans to work. Now that adam and eve were cast out, the fallen angels had control over humanity. Lucifer knew this control would not last long, he knew God would smite humanity with a [Great flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative).

""When adam and eve began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, **the angels of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.** [The Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim) were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth,  The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth So the LORD said, ""I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created--and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground--for I regret that I have made them.""— ***Genesis 6:1–7***

Lucifer needed one more thing for his plan to control humanity to fall into place...he needed a son. Lucifer befriends a man named Enoch and leads him to believe that he is god himself, setting his plans into motion. Next follows the birth of **Noah and his Ark.**

“After a time, my son Mathusala took a wife for his son Lamech. She became pregnant by him, and brought forth a child, **the flesh of which was as white as snow**, and red as a rose; the hair of whose head was white like wool, and long; and whose eyes were beautiful. When he opened them, he illuminated all the house, like the sun; the whole house abounded with light. And when he was taken from the hand of the midwife, opening also his mouth, he spoke to the Lord of righteousness. Then Lamech his father was afraid of him; and ran away to his own father Mathusala, and said,"" I have begotten a son, **unlike to other children**. He is not human; but, **resembling the offspring of the angels of heaven**, is of a different nature from ours, being altogether unlike to us.” – [Book of Enoch](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Enoch_and_UFO%27s)

Once Lucifer's son becomes of age, the Deceiver does what he does best..Lucifer pretends that he is the one true god and commands Noah to build an ark, and to defy god's command, Lucifer tells noah to save his entire family and many animals.""-and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground--for I regret that I have made them.""""

Humanity was wiped out a long time ago after the great flood,We are all descendants of Noah. we are the Nephilim.

TL;DR:Humanity 1.0 as wiped out by the biblical flood. Noah(the guy who survived by building an ARK) was born in a similar fashion to jesus, and had angelic features and powers, he may have been the son of Lucifer of another fallen angel..noah was commanded to build an ARK by a False god in order for Noah to undo the flood, and recreate the world in his (Lucifers) image."
t3_es88xs,all_ads,A Strange Encounter Or Weird Coincidence?,Thetruthishere,"Many years ago when I was 13 years old, I was visiting with my friend at his house (let’s call him Bob) along with another friend of his (let’s call him Rick) We were the only ones home during this time. During our visit we were doing normal bullshit that 13 years olds do such as playing xbox, shooting nerf guns at each other, and things of that sort. Both Bob and Rick regularly attended church and even went to a Christian private school. They were both relatively sheltered and weren’t the type of kids to pull pranks or be mischievous. Late in the afternoon I was bullshitting with Rick while Bob was playing video games about 10 feet away and then Rick decided that he would try and make a pentagram so that he could summon the spirit of his dog. He told me that he had read about it somewhere and wanted to try it. I was and still am open minded yet skeptical, so I watched as he proceeded to do his thing. 

I watched as Rick took about a hundred nerf darts and formed a pentagram shape on the floor. He then said whatever words that were required to complete the ritual, and as soon as he was finished an alarm in the house immediately started blaring. The three of us were a bit freaked out, and Rick destroyed the pentagram. We then ran outside and chilled for about an hour or two. It took the alarm approximately a half hour to stop blaring. Bob was my neighbor so I had went over to this house hundreds of times over the course of my entire childhood and I have never heard any alarm go off that sounded like that one. It almost sounded like an electronic telephone ringing one non stop tone. 

When we all eventually went back inside, night had fallen. The three of us started playing Halo and chalked it up to a weird coincidence. After a couple hours I convinced Rick to try and make a pentagram again to see if we could replicate what had happened earlier. He obliged and again made a pentagram out of nerf darts in the same spot as before. During both of these events Rick and I were standing right next to each other by the pentagram, and Bob was sitting about 10 feet away in plain sight playing video games. Once again, as soon as Rick was finished forming a pentagram and said the magic words, the same alarm went off. We all three again ran outside and waited until the alarm went silent, which took about a half hour. We were all pretty weirded out by it, and we decided not to try and do it again. Bob was noticeably freaked out, and Rick was also in disbelief that it had actually done anything. 

We decided among the three of us to not talk about it with anyone else, lest others will think we are just making up stories. It took me about two years to finally tell other people about it, and at this point I have told anyone who is willing to listen so that I may try and get a better understanding about what really happened to us. I remember going home that night paranoid that a spirit would haunt me, but nothing of the sort ever happened. Bob is still in contact but has since moved away and I haven’t seen Rick in about 8 years. I have brought this up with Bob a few years ago and I asked if he remembered this event. I described it to him and he confirmed that he did in fact remember it happening the exact same way I did, but he didn’t seem to want to talk more about it so I didn’t press it too much. Since this happened I have become much more interested in the unknown and I have a few other experiences to share as well. If anyone can lend any additional insight on what may have caused this to happen, I would appreciate it."

Ill try to keep this brief 

So i guess this is a part 2 although nothing creepy really happened. My mom has this friend who  can see auras or something like that. My mom talked about when my uncle died to her and she seemed to have answers. Then i told her what happened to me, she said that it was a demon as they have no soul or something and that thats why i couldnt see an outline or something like that. I kinda was skeptical of her until she then said that there was an old man that would constantly visit. A frail skinny one. My mom pulled out a picture of my late great grandfather and her friend said that was him, i should mention that i used to feel like and old man was watching me a couple of days before she showed up, thats why i believe her. Now i wonder why did the demon thing come to my house, probably because im a magnet for this crap. If anyone has any ideas why let me know, should mention no one has died in the house i live in but mom says that it had nasty energy when we first moved 17 years ago but thats a story for another day or post i guess"

t3_ern8p7,all_ads,My brother passed away but let me know he is still with me.,Thetruthishere,"*Sorry for any typos. I'm at work and didn't have much time to proofread. Another users post motivated me to finally share my experiences so I wanted to do it now *

This will be quite a long post with a multitude of points. I am giving a heads up but I want to say I really think it is worth the time.

My brother and my best friend passed away unexpectedly in December of 2019. It has been the hardest thing I have ever been through and I have been through a few things. I miss him and I know I always will. But he gave me a few undeniable signs after he passed. They all took place within three to four days after his death with the exception of one that happened a couple weeks after. 


I am writing this post for two reasons. One, I am hoping it will bring comfort to those that lost loved ones. That it will help strengthen your knowing that they are not gone. Two, I am hoping others will read this post and share their experiences of loved ones giving them signs after they passed. I am going to write the events out in chronological order starting with the first, however I am not going to share all of them. Just a few. 

He went to bed and died very shortly after. Sometime between 1 and 2am. My fiance and I were in our house and we were up late as usual. It was about three in the morning and we heard a pretty loud bang. We thought, what the hell was that? I walked out of our room and there was a sign on the wall and it had been pulled off. Not only the sign but the entire nail it was on was missing and the sign was about 6 feet down the hard wood hallway. We have been together eight years and we have had that sign up the whole time. It has never fallen off the wall. We bought a house and moved in about a year and a half ago and it was one of the very first things we put up and it hasn't moved since. The sign had metal grooves/teeth on the back which allowed it to grip the nail very securely. I never ever say things like this because things like this never happen but I said to my girl, ""I wonder if that was your mom trying to say hi?"" I couldn't think of a logical explanation and her mom passed about a year ago. Once again not the type of conclusion I jump to. The words written on the sign were ""keep calm and carry on."" That is the first thing he did to let us know he was ok. It wasn't until the next I learned he passed that I put it together.


Two days after he died my mom, fiance and I were going through all old photo albums to get pictures to make some photo boards for the service. Out of nowhere apparently my arms begin to curl up, I begin shaking, I fall on the ground and start muttering in a way that sounded like sleep talking. They said it sounded like words but they couldn't make it out. Obviously my they both flip their shit and call an ambulance. I come to about 5 minutes later and I'm sitting on the couch instead of the chair and there are EMT's everywhere. It was so weird because to me it was like I blinked and then everything was different. I had a seizure apparently and the weird thing is I have NEVER had a seizure. When I came to they asked me questions and I was definitely a little out of it. Part of my recent memory was gone but I did know what year it was and the president etc. What is weird about this is when I came back to, all I kept repeating was ""all I know is I was talking to (insert brother name)."" I kept on repeating that but said I can't remember what we talked about. This is pretty weird shit in my opinion. I have heard people get regression hypnosis done to help recall memories. I am going to look into it and try it. Maybe I did talk to him. I've never had a seizure as I said and when I came to all I knew is I was just talking to my brother.


Ok so here is the one y'all will probably think is the craziest. Three days after he died it was the night before the service. I was on my way to my dads and we were having a small get together with family. I saw I got a Facebook notification. I rarely ever go on Facebook but the one thing I always do check out is my memories. I check them every day any time I catch the notification. I should have seen this post once a year the past nine years but the weird thing is that I only ever saw it one time. That was nine years ago when my brother wrote it on my wall. I haven't seen it since. Anyways, we both love a band called Tool. They're our favorite, have been for a very long time. He had posted some Tool lyrics on my wall exactly nine years prior to this date. Another weird thing to add here is he rarely used Facebook either and if he had ever posted on my wall besides this time it would have been once more, tops. So I'm on my way to my dads and my girl is driving and I open my memories. This is what I see from him written directly on my wall. 

""Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father. Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended. It's time now, my time now, give me my, give me my wings.""

My jaw about hit the fucking floor. There are just so many weird things about this. One, he wasn't religious, two, he never wrote on my wall, three, what are the odds? I could go on and on and on with my thoughts but I'll spare you. I know in my heart it was him telling me it was his time. Somehow the universe allowed this. I have never believed things were destined to be but this really has me questioning everything. I find immense comfort in this. 


Next is one that may not seem as weird to you but it was a huge one for me. We were very connected and excusing for being even more ""woo"" but I just know it was him. My girl and I got back to my house from cleaning out the apartment. She got out of the truck and went inside. I got out a minute later. As soon as my feet hit the ground there was three very loud owl hoots in a row from the woods across the street. It sounded like it was so close if it was light the owl would be sitting right at the edge of the woods. There is more to this but I want to add I absolutely love all animals but I have this weird thing about owls. Like if I could be any animal without second thought it would be an owl. I absolutely fucking LOVE them. I have never seen one in real life so I immediately was like what the hell? I know you guys weren't there and it's hard to understand but I immediately just knew it was him. So I turned to face the woods and began talking to him. I talked for about five to ten minutes. No more hooting the entire time I talked just those three so far. Then the last thing I said was ""I know you're here right now, but I just want to know that you aren't going to fade away into nothing. I want to know you'll always be with me."" Those was the last words. I began to cry like right after I said it and simultaneously started pivoting to walk towards the door. As soon as I stopped talking, three loud hoots. HOOT HOOT HOOT. Just like the first three when I got out. As I said I know it was him. I took that as him telling me he will always be with me and he wont fade away. Damn it now I'm crying again.


Last one I'm going to share. This was the only thing that happened past the four day mark for whatever reason. This was about two weeks out. My mom and I were driving down the road in my car. We began talking about him. I said mom just remember the words he told us. Remember the message/lyrics he gave us after he died. Then we said something about feeling him around us when we talk to him. No shit right after we said this, the car in front of me changes lanes and now I'm facing the back of a minivan that has a big Tool sticker in the bottom corner of the window. I absolutely did not see this car or sticker before our little conversation. I said ""mom holy shit that sticker is of the band who wrote the lyrics about it being his time and him getting his wings."" We just looked at each other like what the fuck. Then I said see he is with us. I highly doubt that was a coincidence. We were kind of dumbstruck to be honest. 


There is a ton of evidence to support our consciousness goes on somehow without our bodies. Many have had near death experiences where they were clinically dead yet could give doctors, emts, nurses, etc facts about things that were going on they had know way of knowing. Even things that took place on different floors of buildings and totally different locations. Facts people provide after an NDE are called veridical evidence. There is more of it than most would ever imagine and certainly more evidence to support this than it takes to convict someone of murder in a court of law. There are even numerous universities now that have departments dedicated to this type of thing as well as evidence of past lives.


All of these signs brought me so much comfort. They gave me a knowing that he isn't gone. I could never chalk these things up to coincidence. I hope they help anyone else grieving to know their loved one is far from gone. Once again if you have had any similar experiences please share them with me."
t3_ergo2w,all_ads,My deceased father-in-law commandeered our HomePod,Thetruthishere,"My father-in-law lost his battle with cancer and died on January 2. His decline in the end was shockingly fast. He went from able and relatively well to unable to walk to dead within like 8 weeks. The funeral was last weekend. 

My husband’s family is very close knit, and my father-in-law was everyone’s rock, so it’s been really hard for everyone. 

Last night, around 6pm (the witching hour for anyone with young kids) our kids were getting a bit hyped up and crazy so my husband put on an old playlist of mellow music that we haven’t listened to in ages. 

The song Xerces by the Deftones was playing, when all of a sudden the volume on the HomePod spikes up so fucking loud. Like as loud as it can go. I was in the other room with our youngest and thought my husband was just messing around to make our eldest laugh or something. But he was freaked out. He hadn’t touched the volume. When he told me that I got goosebumps and burst into tears. 

That Deftones song is all about saying goodbye. The chorus is “Goodbye, I’ll stay in heaven, new world, new world, and I’ll be waving. Goodbye.”

We don’t know what to make of it. Well, we know what we want it to mean but that raises so many questions. 

Anyone else had an experience like this after a loved one has died?"
t3_errc8p,all_ads,"Episode of sleep paralysis complete with hallucination after home intruder dream, but what was real?",Thetruthishere,"Nightmared for an unknown time (dreams you remember always seem to last all night) about a man looking through my windows at night and stalking the property. I was scared the whole dream, but ripped my door open and confronted them on the lawn, the man retreated trying to explain before transforming into a handicapped woman. I was still mad and afraid about the lurking but then tried to be understanding of the lurker (kind of a befriend them so they won’t kill you sort of mindset) before waking early in the morning, it was still dark, and being completely paralyzed physically though I was awake with all my mental faculties, or so I thought. I saw someone in the doorway to my bedroom and, remembering my dream of the lurker, I was afraid. I heard myself making some guuuurrrrrrfg sounds trying to scream for my boyfriend in the next room but I couldn’t. I even tried to flop my useless hand to my mouth to pry it open to scream. Once I realized I was powerless I looked back at the doorway and saw that the bedroom door was closed and likely had been all night, there was no way I had seen someone standing within it. I was so tired from the experience and in general that I fell back asleep until my alarm. 

Woke up with my alarm and over coffee told my boyfriend of the dream and the episode, he went big eyed saying he had nearly the same dream that night (minus the sleep terror) except he heard dirt crunching as if there were footsteps on rocks in his dream. Now consider the lane behind our house has no out and is laid with all quartz gravel. Needless to say I am terrified of my mind and it’s perceptions but also the realms at large"
t3_ernmd8,all_ads,Bible pages turned on it's own,Thetruthishere,"[This is actually a repost from another reddit page I posted on, I'm posting here to get others opinions on this] 


Hi everyone. I wanted to share this because it's something that happened a few months ago but still bothers me to this day. I have so many questions but unfortunately when I speak of this I feel dumb and kind of crazy. Kind of, because I know what I saw. I'll try to give some back story. 
My grandmother passed away back in 2014. This was a devastating thing for me and my family. My grandmother was the glue for us and my grandmother was everything to me. She loved and cared about me but most importantly she was always there for me no matter what. She had a big heart despite the troubles she had in her life. My grandmother was also very religious. In some ways I believe my grandmother's religious views is what made her such a loving and humble and wise person. Me on the other hand not so much. I believe in God yes but no where near the extent of her. I barely go to church if not at all anymore and my views on God and the bible are very different than most. However I was baptized as a kid and it was my own choice to do so at that time. 
Anyway, after my grandmother's passing I have the bible she gave me open to her favorite passage which is Psalm 23. In the middle of the bible I also have her rosary beads there. Ever since she died I've had that bible open to that passage in respects for my grandmother for years. The only time I close it is when I moved and needed to clean the area it was on. That's it. It's barely touched. 
I have clinical depression and anxiety and over the years my mental state gets worse. This past July was one of the hardest months I had to deal with mentally. That whole month I was suicidal and I felt lost and had so many breakdowns. August 1st during the middle of the night I woke up to the sound of paper moving. I look over to where the sound came from and it was from my grandmother's bible. I turn on my light and I see that the pages are turned. I freaked out. But I completely ignored it and forced myself to sleep. Got up the next morning, didn't even look at the bible really and turned it back to were the passage and the rosary beads where and went to work. That same night I had to sleep with my light on dem because I was still freaked out. But in the middle of the night I wake up and I look over at my grandmother's bible again and I saw the pages turn on it's on. This made me so scared because I couldn't believe I saw it happen. I didn't move or anything I just looked away and said maybe if I sleep and wake up it'll be back to where it's supposed to be and it will confirm I'm just dreaming. 
When I woke up it was still turned. This time I said f it and went over to it and before just turning it I looked at the passage it was open to. The pages had turned and fell to passage Psalm 32. I'm not going to post the passage here but in summary the passage speaks about being blessed and giving your worries etc to God. At first I was extremely emotional. Reading it to me was like hearing my grandmother say stop worrying about everything and just pray. However I'm still questioning everything it actually means. Does anyone have any insight to what may have happened or meaning of passage 32? Like I said, i don't believe as much so me trying to understand it has gotten no where.

I'm sorry for my long explanation btw"
t3_erpt8q,all_ads,What’s yours?,Thetruthishere,What got YOU interested in the “unknown” or the “paranormal” anything from aliens to ghosts to government stuff all the way to alternate universes. What made you become a fan of the “unknown” ? I always love hearing others tell their stories.
t3_ero8wh,all_ads,Has this ever happened to anyone else?,Thetruthishere,"This happened almost 7 years ago, and it’s often been on my mind since then. There’s no straightforward answer, but I’d like to get people’s opinions on it.

A very good friend of mine from school died at age 24 (we’ll call him C). We weren’t on speaking terms for a couple of years before he died (he went really off the rails, got in with a bad crowd and done a lot of drugs - he died of a cocaine OD). He was a pretty bad guy towards the end, and he screwed me over for money and screwed over a few other people, but I like to think of him as the way he was before all that stuff happened. 

The night before his funeral, me and a different friend (who we’ll call K) were standing outside K’s house and he said to me “Do you think C would come back and visit you if he was a ghost?” and I replied no, I didn’t think so. About 10 seconds later, there was a very sharp banging/cracking noise from right beside us. It was so loud it made us slightly jump. It was like something hard being hit very swiftly off of another surface that was hard. 

We were never able to find out the source of the noise. We went around tapping and banging on everything in sight to try and recreate the noise. We even flushed the toilet in case it was the pipes - we tried everything. We could never find a logical reason why that noise happened. I’m a pretty skeptical person but I do generally believe in some form of afterlife or that there are things we cannot and will never be able to explain. 

Has anyone ever heard of a similar situation or can anyone think of a logical reason for what could have caused this?"
t3_ernbwv,all_ads,Should I have opened my eyes?,Thetruthishere,"To start off, I'd like to say, I'm a skeptical person by nature. I don't really believe in anything spiritual and certainly dont believe in the paranormal. I'm very grounded in physical reality, which is why this experience left such an impact on me. 

About 5 years ago, I had an out of body experience. I was in my bed, lying on my side, when I started to float. My feet started first, and soon every part of me, except my head, was floating. I remember it vividly, I was fully concious the entire time.

I remember thinking to myself ""this is what death is like, I'm leaving my body behind."" But it was like my mind kept me anchored. I should also mention that my eyes were firmly shut the entire time. I was afraid of what I might see, as if I wouldnt be able to ""unsee"" it. As a skeptic looking back, I regret not looking. Perhaps I would have seen something interesting. 

And that's pretty much my story. After a few seconds of floating, I calmed my mind and was able to slowly return to my natural, gravity bound, state. I probably should mention that, I was going through a lot of anxiety and depression, at the time. I haven't done much research on out of body experiences, except what I've read on this sub. So if anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated."
t3_erhg1x,all_ads,What happened to me..? What did I see? What did I go through?,Thetruthishere,"I’m sharing this experience cause I want to spread my message and Further more extend just what the belief of “unknown” can be. 


I was around 10 - 11 years old. Meaning this happened about 2010 or 2011, not sure of the exact year but it wasn’t that long ago. But even in 50 years I’ll never forget this. It didn’t feel like it lasted “forever” but more around 30 seconds. But that SMALL 30 seconds was enough to completely change how I live my life and see this world. 

We was on our way to Georgia. I have lived in Alabama my whole life but because Georgia is just a state away, we used to vacation there a lot. Where we lived at, we didn’t have to take an interstate to our destination, just a really long almost trafficless road. I wasn’t that much into paranormal or alien stuff but I wasn’t a non believer or even skeptic. I just didn’t much care for it. My dad was driving us. Mom in the passenger and my little brother beside me in the back seat. I LOVE nature and magical views so I always love getting near mountains or open fields and just looking out the window at as much as possible till the car passes. 


We came to this point on the road to where there was a bunch of power sources such as lines, poles and towers. But a gorgeous mountain behind them all in an open field. Of course, this was my time to take my look at the world. I noticed something in the sky barley moving. I saw 6 grayish black circles. Could have been saucers, could have been holes in the sky, I couldn’t tell. But there were 6 of them, 3 on each side in a triangle formation just like when birds migrate. My dad has studied aliens and government his whole life and to this day he still talks about “project blue book” or “project blue beam” I forgot the exact name. But as you can tell, he knows his alien stuff lmao. 


So as I seen those “things” in the sky I got a little scared as I was still a kid, and I tried to shake him to get his attention, 

HERE is where it got me the most. As I tried to shake him I looked at him and realized, the car wasn’t moving, they was all 3 still there and awake, but it was as if they were all frozen. I will never in my life forget that moment. Everything around me was frozen and it was only for about 30 seconds. I quickly looked back into the sky , and the “things” were gone. And everything around me was normal again except, nothing ever started back up. It was as if nothing froze in the first place. It was almost like time was lost, but it didn’t feel like time was lost. That’s just the only way I can describe how it ended... ever since then I have dedicated half of my life to the “unknown” world. I love it now and now I am 19 years old. I’m so lucky to have found a girlfriend who not only believes me, but who loves this kinda stuff too. I’ve been scared my whole life to share that story with anyone up till about 2 years ago. I’m hoping someone can one day not necessarily give me an explanation, but to have had somewhat of the same kind of experience I had."
t3_ermpa1,all_ads,Has anyone else ever had an experience in their very early childhood where they saw themselves from above?,Thetruthishere,"I have a memory of seeing myself and my parents from above as we sat in a restaurant booth. I remember it was my first time trying Macaroni and Cheese and I believe this to be my first memory or the exact moment when I “Turned On” or started recording memories. 
I don’t know if there’s a name for this phenomenon but if anyone has any experiences or any information related to this I’d love to know. 

I’m also fully aware that this could just be some sort of false memory or a memory of a dream I had but it seemed vivid enough to ask."
t3_erp7gq,all_ads,Dreams,Thetruthishere,"
This might be strange but there were these dreams that later had something to do with the reality that I  would witness. It used to happen a lot when I was a teenager. 
 
My family had a maid to do the daily chores in our house. She used to look after me when I was a kid. Mom and dad had absolute trust on her . She worked for almost a decade in the house and later left the work as she was getting old and weak. 

On one morning, around 5 o'clock , I see her face smiling at me. Just this in the vision I had. Her face with a smile looking at me. I wake up and I'm left in a confused state . It had been years since we saw her. Why this all of a sudden? I tell my mom about it. She just brushes it off saying that it might be just a random recollection of memories. 

I go off to college and the day goes as usual and i get back home in the evening. My mom had this surprised look and tells me that "" I have received some bad news through an aunt who lives nearby the maid's house. She has expired today morning. "" It completely shook me and till date I still don't have any idea on how and why did i get the vision ."

I could have sworn, and still do swear, post malone passed away some time ago from a drug overdose amidst depression over a breakup with another younger starthat im unfamiliar with. I have never been into this particular artist so it wouldn't make much sense for me to imagine such a thing. In my original reality post malone passed away from a drug overdose some time ago. Yet recently i've been hearing of new projects of his. So being curious, I decided to look into it. Not only is he apparently alive, but i cant seem to find any evidence of his death ever having happened. I swear on everything i care for that he was dead. And now he isnt... wtf?"

As we were passing the Tanger outlets we saw a military plane just hovering in the air.  There is an airport in that area so to see the plane low in the sky was normal.  To see the plane not moving was ANYTHING BUT NORMAL..   I heard plenty different opinions.  I certainly welcome more?????  YouTube link:. https://youtu.be/8SbrYj3s5nU.   ✌️❤️👻👽
t3_er2052,all_ads,Grandmother,Thetruthishere,"I don't know when my grandmother ever slept. When I stayed over with her, no matter when I woke in the night to pee or ask for a glass of water, she'd be in the kitchen, drinking black coffee and shuffling out a game of solitaire. During the day she cared for me and my cousins. I decided as a child that of course she simply didn't rest.

Shortly after she died, my four year old cousin Roland said he saw her walking in the yard, looking over her roses. No one else saw her and no one was mean but it was obvious no one but me believed him. I'd seen lots of ghosts. Why not Grandma too?

A few weeks later, I was staying over at my grandparent's house, and Roland and I fell asleep in the living room watching movies together. At 3 AM we both woke up to a weird noise coming from the kitchen.

I say weird, but really, it was familiar. Just strange to hear now, because it was a deck of cards, being shuffled. The light in the kitchen was off, but both of us smelled coffee brewing. We weren't the only people home, so we thought that someone else had woken up and just didn't want to keep on the lights because they were so bright.

Together, we got up and crept down the hall towards the kitchen. Shuffle shuffle went the deck of cards, and the smell of coffee got stronger. We rounded the corner into the room and flipped on the light, and no one was there. The sound and smell vanished with the switching on of the light.

It was eerie for sure, but felt kinda comforting, like Grandma was still watching over us, ready to help if we needed anything in the middle of the night.

I didn't experience this again, but I talked about it with Roland when he was older and as he lived with my Grandpa, he mentioned that he'd seen and heard her a few more times that year before she apparently moved on."

But when we were sorta babies (like 1-2 yrs) we told memories of ""coming down to earth in a big fireball before being born"", and when my cousin said it to my mom, she just sorta shrugged it off, but when my mom heard me say it, she was actually shocked and had no idea how we couldve had the exact same recollection of events.

And to this day ive never found out answers but its always stuck in the back of my mind because its such a specific thing to mention as a baby of all things and not normal, what do you guys think?"

t3_er5i45,all_ads,Does anyone get clumsy around certain people? Like an energy shift making you clumsy?,Thetruthishere,"So, my ex and I were together almost 4 years. We just recently broke up but we still see each other, and it still happens to this day. 

I’m not a clumsy person AT ALL. When I’m by myself or with anyone but him, I never randomly fall, lose balance, drop things, etc. I’m not known to be a klutz by ANY means... my family has a few and we tease them about it all the time, but I’ve never been one of them. 

However, whenever I’m around my ex, I am so clumsy! I randomly lose balance and trip over my own feet. I drop entire plates of food by accident. One time I had to get 3 forks because every time I put one on my plate and went to walk away with it, it would fall on the ground. I’ve dropped cups of water for no reason, spilled COUNTLESS drinks. I trip over nothing on the ground. He has had to catch me so many times when I’m falling, he’s really good at it now because it’s so frequent. The list goes on. 

I keep telling him I’m not usually like this but it’s so frequent that he doesn’t believe me. He thinks it’s a cute quirk that I’m clumsy but I swear to you... when I’m not around him none of this happens. 

It’s happened since the day I met him. I always tell him that it’s like his energy throws me off balance lol. Has anyone had this happen? Does anyone have any answers to this?

On a side note, him and I have had many past lives together before, maybe it has to do with that?"

I remember looking out the window that night and the sky looked yellow. Never seen this before in my life but felt really weird. My family didn’t make anything of it but I felt it was strange/out of the ordinary. Anyone else had this experience?"
t3_equcii,all_ads,MY EXPERIENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE,Thetruthishere,"If anyone can shed some light on this experience, it would be greatly appreciated.  

This story takes place in 2016 when I was paratrooper with 1st Brigade 82nd Airborne, stationed at ft. Bragg NC. I had dabbled in psychedelics since high school but had never experienced leaving my body. In the Army my psychedelic usage only increased considering that LSD and mushrooms did not show up on drug tests. It was December and I had recently stocked up on about 30 hits of acid. I had been taking acid consecutively only leaving enough time in between trips to get an effect.

Anyway, it was a Monday, and we had day and night range planned from 0400 weapons draw going into a night shoot. I was sick of the grunt life. So, I had the idea of making my day at the range a little more fun, by dropping a bunch of acid. I took four 125ug tabs at around 0530 and I kept three in my breast pocket just in case I wasn’t feeling a strong enough trip. Transportation for the range showed up around 7:00, this is when I first noticed the acid creeping up. I remember leaning against my ruck seeing my first sergeant walk outside our company operating facility, his entire face was shifting, and I knew it was hitting. We hopped on the trucks and headed to the range down Longstreet. First thing we had to do when we arrived was zero our rifles. I was an E-4 team leader, an assistant gunner to be exact. This meant I was not closely watched by the non-commissioned officers and I could zero my rifle un-harassed. I looked down my ACOG and attempted to get a good sight picture. I could not, everything was swaying. I fired my three rounds for a grouping and waited for the range to go cold. My grouping was shit, but there was no way in hell I was shooting again. I didn’t wish to draw the attention of anyone who might have thought that I needed help shooting. I grabbed my target and left back to where we put down our rucks. Now at this time I also smoked a spice vape. Yeah, I know that shit is horrible, but I was a dumb fuck who loved weed and spice was an alternative that would not make me piss hot. I could smoke spice literally anywhere because its odor was non-distinguishable from other vapes. So, there I was standing in a circle around my platoon’s rucks with about 5 or 6 other people from my platoon, smoking and joking. I was really upset that I was at the range but at this point I decided to let go of my animosity and just enjoy the heavy dose of LSD. I remember just standing and staring off into the distance. Until I finally caught the eyes of one of my sergeants, SGT Outlaw.

I did not dislike Outlaw, but sometimes he could be a nosy prick. Our eyes locked and he came to talk to me. At first, I could understand him, he was asking me how I liked being a team leader now. Then his words became garbled and quick. I “heard” (he did not actually say these things its just what I heard) him say things like “I know you are on LSD” “I know you didn’t zero your rifle”. “First Sergeant knows too, and he is coming to get you now”. I completely thought that it was SGT Outlaw talking to me. I thought I was fucked. But then I started to notice other things that seemed off. I didn’t hear the gun fire that was previously chattering in the background anymore. I noticed that no one was moving expect for slight idiosyncratic movements. For instance, to my right was Perez, and all I could see him doing was a stationary salsa dance. Even farther to my right was Porras, he was tapping his fingers together and whistling like an evil mastermind, stopping every few seconds to turn in my direction and say, “Its coming!”. Now at this point I also realized that I couldn’t move anything but my eyeballs and slight head movement. After viewing my comrades and their oddities I finally turned my gaze back to SGT Outlaw, but this time he looked different. The major change being his eyes, they were replaced by black swirls. My gaze was stuck on him and I could only feel dread. I remember the voice when he spoke, it was like a loud whisper. It said to me “so you want to take LSD?” “Do you want to learn the secrets of the universe?” “All you have to do is look left”. At that moment I noticed my left peripheral getting dark, it was almost like a flashlight of darkness was shining from my left side. The feeling I got from this maelstrom of blackness was terrible. My sense of dread only furthered. I was not religious, but I prayed anyway. I remember staring at this entity in the form of my NCO, for what felt like 5 to 7 minutes. The entire time I kept repeating to god that I would never take acid again, and to please just let me live. Then I felt control of my head movement slightly return. When the control returned, I heard voices say “: he didn’t do it!” “what a bitch” “pussy didn’t want to know”. When I heard these voices, my dread disappeared and was replaced with a sense of loss like I missed out on something. I might have replied with “no wait! I want to know!” but I don’t remember entirely. But what happened next has been embedded in my memory.

I flew out of my body and into the sky. I kept being pulled farther and farther into the sky at speeds unimaginable. I remember being pulled across the US east to west and then above into space. I arrived at my ethereal destination and landed in a spectral chair in what seemed like a transparent waiting room in space. I could see earth and the stars straight ahead of me. I could also hear typing, but I could not turn my head to see who was typing. When I arrived in this “waiting room” the only feeling I can remember was **NOSTALGIA**. It was the strongest feeling of nostalgia I have ever felt. I also had thoughts that did not feel like they were my own. No joke, I heard a thought go through my head saying in a semi confused yet lighthearted tone, “aw shit what am I doing back here? I need to get back to my body!” Now this thought felt like it came from me, yet I had no conscious decision in making that thought. I sat in the Transparent ethereal waiting room for about ten seconds. After my ten seconds were up, I immediately appeared back on earth in my body, I was facing left toward where the dark maelstrom emitted from. The first 15 seconds back in my body I had absolutely no memory of who I was. Then my memories flooding back in bringing me instant relief. I remember thinking “holy shit I’m a human! My name is Ben!” “I’m fucking alive!” The rest of the day at the range went smooth. I did not feel like telling anyone about my experience at the time. I even ended up taking the rest of the tabs in my pocket because I kind of wanted to see if I could go back. Yes, I was a little horrified at my experience but more than that, I was intrigued. After that day I researched OBE’s, souls, theology and metaphysics. I found some answers but raised more than I found. I had another OBE three weeks later, again on acid but this time in a more responsible location, my barracks room. This one was short yet useful because it confirmed my previous experience. I was listening to an EDM artist (Seven Lions) on my headset. And as I started vibing to the music I closed my eyes and felt myself lift out of my body again, and this time I could move and look around. I looked around my barracks room and could see that the walls were transparent! I could see into every room in the barracks with their inhabitants doing different things like shower, playing video game, eating or even sleep. It was wonderful! But the wonder wore off when I remembered the dread I felt from my previous OBE. I instantly snapped back into my body. When I was reattuned with my physical form my body had instinctively put my hands on the back of my head, as if to be trying to keep my soul connected. I researched this later, I found that souls are connected to our physical forms through a silver ethereal line in the back of our head. I felt satisfied with my discoveries. Still though this was not my last encounter with the other side. My next OBE was months later on leave. I was back home in Los Angeles and it was a lucid dream that had no drugs involved. I’ll save that story for another time though.

&amp;#x200B;

I will not being using real names or locations for this as it is still an open ""cold-case"" ongoing investigation. however I will say this happen in the North East of the United States!

&amp;#x200B;

Myself and my best friend John were young boy scouts and we really enjoyed camping. working toward out merit-badges we had to camp some distance away from other without a tent and minimum of supplies "".22 rifle, handheld CB radio, small amount of rope, and knives. One of the knife's was one of them ones that had a compass and fishing supplies in the handle."" We spoke with our parents about camping on a local mountain. They agreed and we were off. We walked down some abandoned railroad tracks that ran along the mountain. we walked for about 4 miles from my house and hiked to the top of the mountain where there was a clearing. you could see the clearing on the mountain from John front porch.  Our fathers joked about how they could see any fire up using binoculars and they wanted to see a fire burning all night!

During our hike there was nothing out of the ordinary, we spent a lot of time on the mountain and we used old logging road half way up before taking small trails to get to the clearing. On the way up we passed a young couple ""in their 20' or so"" we waved to them but did not speak to them. around 3:00pm we reached the clearing and we started constructing a small lean-to and building a fire.

The area we were in was wide open with little to no trees, lots of stones and huge boulder rocks. The huge boulder rocks were a landmark for our parents, as you could see them from everywhere. for the next few hours nothing happened. we checked in on the CB radio every 2.5  hours. We used the local firefighter channel on the CB radio. This channel was an off channel the local fire department used to chat about off the topic stuff like NHL games and fart jokes.. Every time we checked in about 20 people would respond to jokingly but it was an awesome sense of security!

nothing out of the ordinary happened until around 11:00pm ""only reason I knew what time it was, was because we had to check in within 30 minutes""  we were sitting around our fire talking and joking about who was going to call on the CB this time. That is when we heard a LOUD booming noises, it was not a gun because we knew what they sound like, this was a long ""10 second"" boom that reverb on itself and the ground vibrated softly. We looked at eachother and I said ""WTF was that!"" John made this huge smile on his face and made a joke ""I farted!"". We laughed and I pointed toward some large boulders where the sound seem to of come from and jokingly said ""your ass is over there then"". John someone who was always fearless got up and continued to make jokes as he walked over towards the boulders. John got just out of the firelight and I could hardly make out his outline on the night sky.

I remember his exact words  ""Here ass, come here ass, you be---""

&amp;#x200B;

I laughed and said ""you be, what? John!! You be what?""

&amp;#x200B;

I waited no less than 30 seconds and got up and walked towards John, just knowing he would jump out scaring the shit out of me. As I walked towards the boulder where i last lost sight of him bracing myself. I remember saying ""M-Fer if you scare me ill shit on you when you fall asleep"" I reached the boulder and could not find John. I yelled for him to come out, I give up, come out. about 5 minutes searching around and over the large boulders I got extremely scared, dont know why, but a sudden pain of greff fell over me and I was really really scared! I ran back to the fire grabbed the CB radio and started screaming for my dad.  ""DAD JOHN IS MISSING, I AM SCARED, DAD, I THINK SOMETHING IS AFTER ME, DAD, DAD, DAD!!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I dont know why I instinctively started screaming in to the radio. Thinking about it all these years it was only 5 minutes since I seen him, but I felt SO SCARED!!

&amp;#x200B;

So many people on the radio respoined ""Were on our way, keep the fire going so we can find you!"" Then my father said the words that hunted me and as I type this brings fear and tears to my eye!

""Brian, Grab your rifle put your back to the tallest rock and shoot anything that does not have a flashlight!""

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I do not know why he said that, he never would tell me and he took why he said it to his grave!

&amp;#x200B;

I did as I was told, I dropped the radio and grabbed the .22 rifle and put my back to a rock still within the light of the fire.  it felt like a lifetime but it was only 20 minutes after my dad said what he said and half the law enforcement and fire department showed up. I remember from where I was standing I could see the headlight and flashing lights of the emergency vehicles coming towards the mountain, up the old logging trail and toward me.  As they pulled up everyone was yelling ""Brain DONT SHOOT, WE ARE HERE, DONT SHOOT!""

&amp;#x200B;

There were around 50 people that night that came to my cries and they wasted no time searching for John. no one could find him or any sign of where he went, the only thing that we found was the large knife that had the accessories in the handel and the flashlight on top of the boulder where John went missing. This was odd because these were in the lean-to with the leftover rope stuff we had.

They searched for 3 days, I was interviewed by everyone in law enforcement, before I was interviewed by the F.B.I. The young couple was interviewed and nothing, they were woken up by all the vehicles and emergency sirens.

&amp;#x200B;

When the F.B.I. got involved they took my .22 rifle and had it checked to see if I recently shot it, I had not, they took the knifes and check them over, they took my clothing and everything. They brought me back up to the mountain had had me reenact the that night. I remember they called me a murder they said they knew I killed him and I was going to jail forever. I was fucking 11 years old! &lt;--real age at the time! this went on for a year.

I use to go over to John's house and speak with his father and mother everyday asking if he came home yet.. I remember the first time his mom said to me ""where is my baby, what did you do!?!"" she said this to me every day, she would come over to my house sit in the driveway and I would walk out and she would roll down the window and say that in a soft voice. John's dad on the other hand was the opposite, he would talk to me and was always super nice to me. He still is to this day, I call him every time I think of John. even now to this day he never says anything out of the way towards me. John's mother had passed sometime ago. from what I was told her last words were ""ask Brian where my baby is!"".

&amp;#x200B;

to this day, No sign ever showed up of John, no body, no clothing, NOTHING!

To this day, it hunt's me. I have nightmares almost every night of that night, I am always writing down my nightmares in a journal hoping I would write something that I had forgotten, but it's almost always the same, nothing new!

&amp;#x200B;

The mountant where all this has happen now has loads of houses on them, they start building houses there in the late 90's I remember going with John's father one weekend and we searched the  area when they were clearing the trees that were around the clearing. but we found nothing.

What REALLY FUCKS me up, is I just seen ""Missing 411""  I can't but help saying ""That happened!"" ""Why is that/this happening!?""

This is my story, it has defined me and molded me to who I am today. it has affected me in so many ways and it will hunt me to the end!

I will answer questions, but I will not answer question that could tell you who I am or who John is, or his father. I called his father and asked if I could post this and this was his request. he is an elderly man now and I do not want to bring any unrest."
t3_er376s,all_ads,Hooded Figure appearing at age 3,Thetruthishere,"So I've never reached out to strangers about this but I'm sick of only being able to discuss this with very few in real life. I know hooded figures are common stories people have as children and even adults but mine feels beyond a typical story of the figure -lurking- or just watching. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have many early memories from age 2-4 and while people generally don't believe me - I even remember being baptized as a baby but its in an out of body experience - I can see my uncle holding me (a priest) and my parents next to him as I'm baptized. Then for whatever reason I have many memories from a specific apartment we lived in when I was a toddler. I have an out of body memory of my sister hiding in a closet and I'm standing outside of it and she leaps out and scratches my face (I have a scar on my cheek - I'm now 27) My parents didn't have much money, had three kids, and a two bedroom apartment. My oldest brother had his own room and my parents shared a room with my little sister and I. They would switch between two beds with us in each one - at the end of the beds/room was the entry to the walk-in closet which led to a bathroom. To the left of that closet entry was the entry to the bedroom. Unimportant but rather how much I remember of this place and that layout has been confirmed by my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

So one night I woke up on the floor, between the two beds, and I look at the door to the room. A very dark, hooded figure, taller than the door, is standing outside the room. It was so tall that it had to duck to enter the room. I was terrified and my heart still races when I recall this memory or hallucination(?) it slowly walked towards me and stopped at the edge of the beds - directly in front of me. I'm now shaking and too afraid to scream or wake anyone. It wasn't exactly walking either - it seemed to glide. Terrified - it begins to glide towards me and I crawled into a ball and covered my face shaking. Then I black out and in the morning wake up in bed again.

&amp;#x200B;

I never told my parents until I was an adult and my mom shared that they both had strange things happen at this apartment complex too - so much so that they moved after the lease was up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had many many many strange things happen throughout life. But this memory haunts me daily."
t3_eqljzw,all_ads,I always know when someone has negative energy/“bad vibes” from the second I meet them but nobody ever believes me.,Thetruthishere,"Ever since I was little, I’ve always known from the instance I meet someone whether or not they are inherently a good person or a bad person. Because of this I do indeed believe that everyone is either good or bad and there is no in between. 

When I meet someone who is a bad person/had negative energy it’s like a sixth sense I guess.. I’m not sure how to describe it. I guess the closest way to describe it is I get a sense of irritation but it’s deep in my chest. 

Every time one of these people come across my life/family or friends lives, I always try to warn them but my warnings are never heeded. And of course, down the road something happens with this person and those I was attempting to warn say stuff like “They’re such a bad person I can’t believe I didn’t see it sooner!” or “I can’t believe they did that, it’s so uncharacteristic of them!”

I firmly believe that if a bad person tries to be good, it will only last for so long. I think people are born either good or bad, and because of society those born “bad” try to be good, but their true side reveals itself eventually."
t3_er5tlx,all_ads,Weird coincidences,Thetruthishere,"I was reading another thread and it made me think of a particular experience, and I was wondering if something similar has happened to anyone else. This happened back in my old apartment. One evening I woke up suddenly from a dream that someone was standing in the doorway of the bedroom. I did not get up and go to the door just attempted to go right back to sleep. Some time later while trying to fall back asleep my husband sat up, walked towards the door, and held a full conversation. My husband has always talked in his sleep, and there were several times this type of conversation happened in that apartment after this experience. I could only hear bits and pieces of the conversation and he didn’t remember any of it the next day."

Then I saw , moving  from east to west a view like through  a magnifying glass .  I could see the stars through it but they were a bit stretched and outside the middle the stars were moving around the center . I looked a little like those pictures of a gravitational lens . It was moving at a  slow speed in a straight line and I could see the effect from were I was  straight above me for 20 to 30 seconds up to the horizon .  It had a size of 15 to 20 meters ( I can’t  calculate it’s height so it could have been bigger)It as a warm summer night with an absolute clear view?. I still don’t know what it was."
t3_eqysjv,all_ads,A “life-long” “power” to alter reality,Thetruthishere,"This is probably one of the only times I’ve shared this particular tale, as I’m still 90% sure it’s just a matter of confirmation bias and happenstances. 

But then, there’s that 10%, which sometimes makes me wonder if there’s something to it.

Throughout my life, I’ve experience some interesting phenomenon: whenever I said something, that thing started to happen. But not always—only when I do it without meaning it. 

And that’s the part the sounds probably crazy. 

It all begin while I was a little girl of about 6, and after having breakfast (a special dish my dad used to make with bread and eggs), I was alone on the dining room and was writing (something I love to do) and I created a story where my dad was bringing me that dish once again. A couple of minutes later, he was in, bringing me another one for some reason he wasn’t sure of (he told me he had feel like doing it again).

I thought that was odd, and totally out of character, and my child’s mind obviously went to the idea that I had somehow rewritten reality in a way. 

I was of course half-joking, but that was the start of several instances through more than. 30 years of things sometimes happening around me, good or bad, when I had happen to mention them before, without intending to. 

Lying to my girlfriend that I was late due to traffic? Thing happened and there it was. Jokingly telling someone a test wouldn’t happen? It was off for some reason. Mentioning to someone that my business was fine since we had three projects underway, while knowing that was the case and we were about to close? Some minutes later, some (three) emails were there from clients interested on our services.

I’ve of course thought about gaming that system but it almost never works since as soon I have an intention behind, then it stops working. I’ve managed to convince people to make me say something after I’ve forgotten I have (or weren’t thinking about that) to then saying it, realizing it and haven’t then surprised it was happening.

Of course, nothing has been life shattering (perhaps the biggest one was closing a business investment that I’d never thought we’d get, after trying to save face to someone instead of acknowledging we  were about to be screwed), most instances have been around being really lucky in several things (and quite unlucky in others), and others impacting someone else (people about to get fired but they got way better offers after I had mentioned them they would).

Once again, I know this sounds quite silly, and I’d assume every one of them could be explained as coincidence and dumb luck. And it’s also related to how I love improvising and saying things even if I’m not 100% sure they are true (or true yet)

But seeing the trend and amount of times they have happened, it does make me wonder there’s something else (friends and partners have always commented how my luck was so extreme).

Has anyone else felt the same? Could someone think of another explanation to silence that 10% of doubts?"
t3_eqt37n,all_ads,Something in the Corn Field,Thetruthishere,"This happened a while ago, back in September. My friend and I like to go on late night drives through the country, eating snacks and just chatting about different things. On this particular night, she wanted to visit her mom since we were gonna be nearby. Her mom still lives in the same house that my friend grew up in, which is in a heavily wooded area by a lake, out in the country. As we were leaving, she turned and we started driving past a corn field. I was about to comment on how high the corn was, when my friend suddenly smacked my leg. ""Do not. Look in the corn."" She sounded very serious, but despite myself, I glanced over. There were a pair of red eyes  in the corn, and since she was driving fast, it was only for a split second. I had to stop myself from saying anything, but I had a feeling she knew anyway, just because of how fast she drove to get past the field and how she remained silent up until we were a good mile or two ahead of it. My friend has always had a fear of cornfields, and no matter how many times I ask her, she refuses to tell me why. Her husband did tell me that it's because of something called ""corn demons"", I know what I saw...but at the same time I don't. I have no idea what it could've been."
t3_eqt1hz,all_ads,Does anybody have any stories about any experiences you may have had with The Hat Man?,Thetruthishere,The Hat Man is probably one of the scariest paranormal entities that actually terrifies me and sends chills down my spine when I read and hear stories about this entity. The scariest thing is that I've actually had a few weird experiences with it in the past.
t3_eqmn6z,all_ads,Strange incident surrounding my mother's death.,Thetruthishere,"I created an account just to post this here as I think most people who know me would think this is crazy. I'm not a superstitious person and I never really believed in anything paranormal until this occurred. 

My mother was an extraordinary woman who faced and beat a lot of hard odds. She married a man ( my father) who her family did not approve of at a very young age, had 6 children ( I'm #2), lost her husband and our dad at a young age to a drink driver, started a business in a small town from the ground up to support us,and became a pillar of the community where we lived. During all this she not only beat Cancer not once but twice. 

She wasn't so lucky the third time around. I ended up moving back to the family home with my wife to care for her. Her health fluctuated a lot during the last year to highs so good we'd thought she'd beat it a third time to lows so bad we were sure she wouldn't make it though the week. She'd had a really good 2 months when she just took a nose dive for the end. She went into the hospital for the final time and lingered for about a month and a half. 

She was unconscious for most of the final stay but when she would come to you could tell she was fighting and just couldn't let go. It got to a point where I had called all of my siblings to come in because the end was close . My favorite nurse was on duty so I knew mom would be taken care of so I went home to eat and shower. 

My wife and I were having a conversation in the kitchen while making food when there was a huge thud from outside the living room. I went outside and there was a cardinal who had flown into the large glass window and died. I didn't think anything of it, disposed of the bird, and went back to what I was doing. 

10 minutes later there was another huge thud at the front door. My wife and I both went and it was another cardinal who'd flown into the front door and died. I disposed of the bird and was a bit weirded out. 

We sat back down to dinner and about 15 minutes later there was yet another huge thud at the back of the house. We went to look and it was another cardinal that had flown into the side of the house and died. 

As soon as we walked into the house the phone started to ring. It was the hospital calling to let us know my mom had passed. 

We rushed to the hospital and got everything taken care of and started calling everyone. I started with my older brother and he was taking it very hard and he just out of the blue mentioned that a bird had hit his bedroom window. I asked what kind it was and it was a cardinal. As I called each sibling they ALL volunteered similar information seemingly out of the blue. 

Please note at the point, none of them had spoken to each other or my wife.  I did not ask about birds at any point. The birds were brought up organically by each sibling like it was something important and all birds were cardinals.

My siblings live all over the US with only 2 of us in the same state but 3 hours apart. I put it in the back of my mind until her funeral. All of my siblings and their families had made it in. The night of the Receiving of Friends the funeral home was packed and I slipped out with one of my sisters, one of my brothers, and his girlfriend to get some air. We were standing behind the funeral home when one of the workers walked around the corner of the building with a dust pan. If you guessed that the dust pan contained the body of a cardinal that had flew into the front of the funeral home you are a winner. 

The next day was the burial. We get to the cemetery and the whole place is just full of birds of all kinds. I'm talking blanketed with birds. I don't think that I've ever seen that many birds in one place before or since. It wasn't just something that happens in the cemetery either. My dad is buried there too and we've visited loads of times before and since. 

My siblings and extended family have all talked about it since and all agree it was really weird. About two years later I came across that a lot of culture believe birds/birds flying into your home is an omen of death. Myself and all of my siblings now see cardinals before any major life event and any time we seem to be thinking of mom a lot. We always tell each other of seeing them now as they seem to be a sort of family symbol. 

I know it's not really creepy but it is strange. I thought it belonged here in case anyone had any similar experiences.

Edit: I'm really blown away by so many similar experiences. I've been getting a lot of questions to my inbox that I'll add here.

1. My mom had no meaningful connection to cardinals or even birds in general. She didn't collect them or anything. She actually collected tea pots and tea cups and after being asked I did check them and none of them feature cardinals. There is one peacock set and that's the only bird in the collection. 

2. My wife and I along with our children still live in the house and currently own it. My siblings and I decided we really wanted to keep it in the family since Mom and Dad built it. Everyone is welcome here and the door is open if anyone needs a place. It's been 6 years ( 7 in February)  since she passed and nothing spooky or creepy has happened otherwise. I don't think we are haunted by mom or dad. 

3. My siblings and I are all very close. We don't always get a long 100% of the time but we do care deeply about each other and are friends as well as siblings. We are are all pretty closely spaced in age as they had us pretty much back to back. There are 15-18 months between most of us with the exception of my younger brother who is the baby of the family and he's two years younger than my youngest sister. We don't live close together but it's very unusual for us to go a week without everyone talking to everyone in some form. I volunteered to take care of Mom because my wife and I were in a place that we were easily moveable and COULD do it without hassle or fuss since people feel I was saddled with her. I was in a career I didn't love and my wife can literally work anywhere she wants in her chosen field. It was a no brainier. I'm glad I got to spend so much time with her at the end and my siblings weren't deadbeats only showing up after she passed. All of them visited at one point or another and helped out in various ways."

t3_eqqna6,all_ads,Premonitions (of a sort),Thetruthishere,"So, for a few years now, I have noticed that I am able to look at someone and tell....things....about them. Random things.
For example:
I used to work with a girl named Alexis. One day at work, she came and told me that she was pregnant. I had already known this, and she asked me how I knew. I didn't have an answer. I told her that I didn't know, and she kept pressuring me into giving her an answer. I didn't have one for her, because I didn't understand myself. I did, however, end up saying something to her that completely freaked her out.
I told her that she was about a month and a half along. She was, and according to her, she hadn't told anybody that, not even her boyfriend.
Example 2:
There was also a time when I was with a group of friends, and we were trying to get each other to tell us secrets. I had ended up falling asleep in another room, but I woke up and asked my friends what they were doing. They told me, and I automatically pointed at one of the coolest guys in the group and said he was gay. Everybody was shocked, and obviously didn't believe me, but he turned bright red and came out of the closet to us."

It usually comes out of two points on my back or the top of my neck, and always goes upwards to my head. I can feel it quite vividly, like kind of silk or mist floating up and surrounding usually my head, but also my legs sometimes. When it goes to my head, it ends in this flame like form, stretching beyond my head. 

when this happens, I usually get super aware of my surroundings, and I always feel this rush of confidence over me, like i can't be beaten. It also feels warm, so if i'm cold, I can just do this and i'm warm again.

t3_eqjmw7,all_ads,"My nightmares became dreams, but I feel I have a connection with something unexplainable, maybe evil.",Thetruthishere,"This is going to be a long story, only to purely grasp all the details I have experienced during an episode that I have yet to decipher to its full content. I will start with continual dreams I’ve had for close to 20 years, and I’m 29.

   During my childhood, I would have these nightmares that would terrify me. In them, I was usually running in the woods that were behind my house, a good 2-3 acres worth. In those woods is a patch of dead pines. About 30-40 dead pines circled about in a 40 yard radius. 
   I would always end up in the area in every nightmare, and always feel pulled towards the center of the mass exodus of pines. In the center would be a pile of deer carcasses, with a single deer carcass from the bottom of the ribs and up, sitting on top, with human hands and eyes of black. This deer boasts giant horns, with lots of tines going in each direction. 
   This deer welcomes me as soon as I appear by it, and speaks to me as if we’ve spoke many times. The worst part though, is that I remember the smell of decay and the cold that is put off of this figure. Each instance, we have conversations of life. 

I ask who it is, what is it doing here and how I got here. Plenty of times. It responds the same each time: “I am the darkness with no name, and I inhabit this area. You found me, remember?”
It’s voice of many echoes back. 

   Ten years ago, these nightmares have simply became dreams. They do not terrify me anymore, and I seem to look forward to them. The last one I’ve had happened about a year ago, and I thought maybe posting this could help me fall back into them. I feel like a part of me is gone when they are not around. 
I do not know what this is, anyone have an idea on what I am experiencing? Is my psyche damaged? Does it all have a meaning? 
Thanks for reading."
t3_eqj8pz,all_ads,I think me trying meditation either brought something to me or opened my eyes enough so I could perceive what was already there,Thetruthishere,"This was at my last house. I was really interested in meditation (still am) and I did a lot of them there, some guided, some not.

After some time I started noticing things. Things like shadow people, strange lucid dreams, unexplained noises, and an unexplained small entity I saw once in between a cracked door.

The shadow people were okay. I mean, they startled me at first, but there weren't doing anything to me so I ignored them. Most were adult size however one was child size.

I tended to lucid dream anyways but these ones were ... odd. There were three voices, all male; one was very deep, one was calm/friendly, and the last was, well, crazy. Always laughed. I would be laying down in my bed and they'd be talking above me but I could never see them, just the room and myself.

Another lucid dream I tended to have was somewhat similar.

I'd be in bed but this time the voices aren't there. I would feel my body sliding off, one way or the other, sometimes right through the bed. I could see a space with stars if I'd get far enough. It would just be black if I went through the bed itself.

At one point, I was entirely out of my body. I could see myself. It didn't last long, though, because it startled me to the point where I woke up. I haven't experienced this since.

The last lucid dream I had during this time also took place in my bed. A lady in white was there in the room with me. She went to my side of the bed, leaned over me, and told me to be careful with what I said and did. She then kissed me on the forehead. I woke up with it tingling and warm.

For the unexplained noises, I was almost asleep when I heard the first one. 

I also 'saw' what made the sound. It was a door. Right after that image passed through my mind, I heard it slamming ... loudly. It was so loud, I got up and asked my mother if she just slammed a door or something.

This, however, could be an auditory hallucination. This can happen on the verge of sleep. But I also saw the thing that made the noise right before the noise so I'm not certain if was a natural occurrence or not.

I also would hear music while I was fully awake. It was really nice music, too. Classical. With violins, pianos, and the like. I actually loved this and would just listen to it whenever it popped up. Would also smell perfume at times, mostly when I'd first wake up. No one in my house wore perfume expect on special occurrences.

And, finally, the unexplained entity.

Could have been a dog, if I'm to be honest (we do have a yorkie about the same size), but what it did wasn't in character for her. I felt like I was being stared at so I looked at the door and, right in between the crack, I could see something that was small, brown/greenish with large yellow eyes.

When it saw me, it disappeared. Our yorkie would have pushed the door in and ran inside. Peeking in on me isn't what she, or any of our dogs, would do.

So, yeah, after we moved I stopped doing meditations and I haven't had a strange or unexplained thing happen to me since.

TL;DR: My meditation apparently opened a door with a lot of shit inside, some were good (music, nice perfume, a lady in white who kissed my forehead), some not (demonic beings who made fun of me, an unknown peeking entity). It has since stopped after I stopped doing meditation and moved away.

Didn't know what to tag this as because there's a lot that happened. Sorry if it's wrong!"
t3_eqlrbv,all_ads,They speak to me.,Thetruthishere,"I've never posted here, so I don't know how to put all of this in a post properly. This is something wierd, but I do want someone to explain it to me. They started speaking to me when I was 7. This doesn't mean I hear ghosts or anything, rather, I hear only one person. They don't give me premonitions or anything, all they do is speak to me like anyone else. Growing up I brushed it off as me speaking to myself in my mind. It wasn't until recently I noticed small details that made me wonder. For one, I'd hear it even when I didn't think to myself. Second, their voice is female. I am male, and I don't know anyone who's voice sounds like that. I can speak to them, be it verbally or mentally, and they would respond which makes me further believe they are a seperate being from me. I only realized how wierd that is when I noticed I felt less alone. It isn't like I sense the presence of someone but it's like someone who knows me better than anyone else is always with me. While I think I never will, I do hope to find someone else who experienced or is experiencing this, and if anyone who reads this experiences this I'd like to hear your story."

At the time, it was just a fun abandoned place to explore with my friends, but soon I was informed of a legend that started to make encounters more chilling. A classmate of mine told me of a what he thinks was a disgruntled homeless man who would roam the site. He told me this guy was violent, rabid even. The guy told me that he for some reason had horns which I thought was an exaggeration but I suspect that the guy may have cutaneous horns. One time I went alone to explore when i came across a foul smelling underground room. There was an old mattress covered in grass and trash as well as what i suspect was a deer carcass on the floor of the room along with more tiny bones and feathers which most likely belonged to an owl. I high tailed it out of the room and headed home, as I did not want to come face to face with whatever was dwelling in that place. I've been back time to time and have heard some scary noises like screaming and loud thuds.

Anyway, I was walking home on my trail. It recently snowed, so I was stepping and slipping, as usual. But I was nearly home when I hear the sound of pitterpatter and crunch of snow.. Suddenly I hear a really high pitched giggle and notice a creature leap from one side of the trail to the other, behind me. I stood there, before fear filled my heart.I could see it’s shape. It was like a ball. I bursted out with speed, running  down the trail, and slowing down a few feet ahead.

First of all, my dog, Rain, loved being next to me wherever I went. So, when she passed on, I heard noises every now and then when I was in my bedroom. Then, when the noises stopped in my room, I felt a presence in my room. Once it turned night time, I felt that presence and when I tried to sleep in my room, it gave me nightmares. I woke up sweating and feeling something right next to me, looking down at me. Slowly, the feeling of a presence started to diminish. I felt relieved when it started to go away, but never knew why I kept feeling this presence or why it went away in the first place.

A month later, I went with a friend to go to the grocery store and pick out a candy for the night. I paid for the both of us, swiped my card, got the receipt, and left. Later that night, I looked at the receipt to see how much I paid for the candy and I paid $3.33. For about a month or so, I saw the number 333 continuously. Ever since then, I’ve been seeing numbers repeated continuously like 222, 111, 555, etc.

After seeing this, does anyone else see numbers like this? What’s your story? Does anyone know what’s happening?"
t3_epyuk3,all_ads,"""When i was a kid i saw a clear white lady""",Thetruthishere,"Hey I'm new here so i just want to share my experience about what I saw when i was a kid about 6 or 7 yrs old, back then when my grandma is still alive we would go to her place to visit as a family this was a routine for us family to once in every summer days of the year we visited and stay for a couple months to my grandma's house going back i never gave it a clear sense of idea what was the figure i saw, it was about one afternoon i think it's nearing to sunset i was regularly playing in the area were all sorts of trees and a wide place to play with as my grandma's house is covering a huge area of her house i guess 3 acres don't know but the house itself was downright creepy for me as a kid lots of stuff around there, going back i was alone playing and all of a sudden i felt like there was a cold breeze touching my back i didn't notice it at first but after a while i heard my mom is yelling me to come home already as the night is getting late for a kid to play outside. As you know here in the Philippines a lot of Filipinos believe in the superstitious belief when you kids playing late at night outside of the house someone will come and join you or even play with you until they can eventually abduct you because children is the most vulnerable to abduct and i believe children has the ability to see things otherworldly from our world as an adult. Now getting back to the story i heard my mom yelled at me but i continue to play outside you know i was a stubborn little kid back then so i continued to what i was doing then suddenly for the third time i felt again thexold breeze but this time it was more intense so i notice at my back as i stare along the area i saw from a far a white entity clear as paper but i noticed that she or he doesn't have a feet she was floating just like the wind breezes me again i also noticed that she doesn't have a face as i was staring at the entity that's when i realised that my body shake or i have the tingling feeling in my spine rose up to my head that this is not normal i cried and called for my mom i yelled so loud that she ended up running for me. Later that i had a fever my grandma told me that I should not go anymore outside to play as also my granny is a faith healer she told me that she can sense spiritual entity when i was playing outside. This was not my first time feeling it when i was in her house almost every time i felt that someone is watching me back when i was a kid, but that was the first time seeing it up close and personal that up until these days gave me goosebumps all over recalling it.

Anyways thinking back now i believe that there is a mystery this world has no one ever had a clear understanding yet.

t3_eq8i39,all_ads,I had a weird expierence in the middle of the night when I was 15,Thetruthishere,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've been wondering about this for over ten years now. It's not super creepy, but it certainly creeped me out when it happenend.

When I was around 15 I had a quite heavy, black alarm clock to wake me up for school every morning. The clock was placed on a shelf that was on the opposite wall to where my bed was, about 2 meters away, so I would have to get up to switch it off.

One night I woke up from an extremely loud bang that came from inside my room. I didn't know what it was, I was just lying in bed with my eyes wide open and my heart racing. As I was trying to calm myself down (I was still too tired to get up and check what it was - and too scared, too I guess), the door to my room opened and my mother came in. At the time she usually slept in the living room, which was directly under my room. She asked me if I was okay, because she had heard a loud noise and thought I had fallen out of my bed. I quickly without thinking answered yes and she went back downstairs, but I was thinking to myself ""Holy shit, she heard it too!"" So it definitively wasn't a dream. I don't know why I didn't check what caused the sound right then.

Eventually I went back to sleep and when I woke up in the mornig I didn't remeber what had happen at first. The thing is I was not woken up by my alarm clock, my inner clock apperently had woken me up around the same time. I got up and I suddenly remembered what had happened during the night, because I saw my clock lying on the floor, like right in the middle of my room. Not close to the shelf it was standing on before, more like about one meter away from it. The batteries on the other hand had somehow been removed from it and were scattered on the shelf. As it was now broad daylight, I wasn't feeling scared anymore, I picked up the clock and put it back, then I went downstairs to the kitchen were my mother was. I said to her ""Do you remember that weird noise last night?"" And when she replied yes, I told her what I just had seen. I don't remember what she said and that's basically the end of the story. Nothing like that ever happened again and the clock eventually was thrown out as it was broken.

I told this story to my brother a couple of years ago (he was to young back then)  but he didn't believe me and said I must have dreamt it. But that's most certainly not the case. the clock never worked again after that night and I didn't want it in my room anyway.

Does anyone here have an explanation for this? Or maybe something similar happening? I'm happy to reply to questions, if anything is unclear (English isn't my first language, so I might have made some mistakes)."
t3_eq7i4h,all_ads,My teddy bear saved my life,Thetruthishere,"Idk if this belongs here but hear me out...Sorry that this is super long! 

I have an teddy bear (named Bearbear) I’ve had since birth and sleep with her every night. Won’t be posting pics because she’s a 20 year old tattered as my mom washed her too much when I was little. Anyway, I had been going through a rough patch in life. Struggling in college, depressed, not sure if I wanted to continue on in school, bad break up, etc. 

**I guess it’s also important to add that I’m an empath. 

I had been having nightmares every night but they weren’t too bad. I’d wake up tired, feeling drained the next morning but I thought it was just typical nightmares. Then one night I dreamed I was someone else- a teenage girl babysitting her family friend’s kid. In this single dream a week of “dream time”passed by with all these weird things happening. Now this kid was super creepy and I grew increasingly afraid of him throughout the dream. He would put me in situations where I would get hurt. He ran into the middle of on coming traffic and stood there, so I had to run out and save him. Nearly missed getting hit by a car. He would run through the house with scissors and when I’d try to grab them from him, he’d cut me “accidentally.” I also felt he was stalking me outside of my time babysitting him. 

Then one night (still same dream) I was out with friends driving around when they pulled out a ouija board and tried to contact spirits. Only problem was they contacted a demon that was supposedly possessing the little boy I had been baby sitting. We got very creeped out and decided to pull the car over for all of us to calm down. Suddenly the boy I had been baby sitting appeared in the street behind the car and clenched his fist at us. We were creeped tf out and one of my friends knew a medium who could tell us wtf was going on. 

We drove directly to this medium’s house and immediately I felt I was being choked but nothing was there. The medium laid me down on her dining room table, told my friends to gather around holding hands and pray. She said a very strong demon was trying to possess me. They kept praying over my body while I felt like my soul was being pulled away from my body. I couldn’t breathe. 

I was fighting to wake up! Finally I woke up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. Bearbear my teddy bear was laying spread eagle across my chest (kinda making a cross symbol) facing the ceiling (not facing me!). I immediately felt like she was trying to protect me from something...it felt like a protective stance and I could feel love and fear radiating off of her. I glanced around my room but didn’t see anything. 

So what do you guys think?? I’m still scared shitless when I think about this. And yes I still have Bearbear!! I really would like some feedback, I posted this in r/paranormal but they think I made this up. I understand it may be hard to believe but this shit really happened. Somebody please help 😩"
t3_eqe2kt,all_ads,I almost was sucked out of my body... at Church Camp!,Thetruthishere,"This is somewhat of a part 2ish of my last post on here, about the time I thought I heard God/Jesus.

Bare with me, this could be a near-death experience or just a spiritual, but it was crazy at best. 

Take into account that this was 2 years after my first experience 

For some background information, every week, a new pastor/speaker comes to talk to us about  God, throughout the week.
The speaker we had for my week was named Heathe. He was my favourite speaker of all the 10x I’ve been to the camp. He’s also Icelandic/Canadian Citizenship.

Anyway, after Fireside, he told us to go onto the field and lay down, and look up. All of the camp layed down and looked up including me. He told us to just listen what he says and look up.
He began playing smoothe, relaxing Icelandic Music. 

I watched the blue sky and white fluffy clouds pass by, and evertime, I’m thinking about heaven, I’m thinking about life, and our purpose throughout. It was not until I closed my eyes, when crap went down.

All I could see, was a sunset in the clouds. You could see the clouds, flowing like a river, and going down a path. At that moment, I’m not sh*tting you here, I felt a kingdom. Think about a large, cobblestone cathedral. I could feel it. I could feel the precense of God’s Kingdom on earth, It felt amazing. But, I felt something different. It felt like my body was getting lighter. It felt like if you had a bottle with water and laid it on it’s side. It was as though I was getting pulled out. Suddenly, I feel my arms shaking and twitching. It felt like I couldn’t stop it. My arms flailed around, and I couldn’t open my eyes. I felt my chest jolting up and down, as if I was getting pulled up. I tried to resist. Now, imagine being a kid laying next to me, seeing this happening. A kid jolting his chest up down, legs and arms going bonkers. It was like I was having a seizure, but not. I felt my chest slowly go down, my arms stopped flailing, and I felt at ease. 
I opened my eyes, and looked around, thinking people saw it happen, no one did luckily.

I can still feel the Kingdom of God sometimes. Depends on the mood, but this story, I promise, is entirely true."
t3_epkprj,all_ads,Could my town be a hotspot for Extraterrestrial/Inter-dimensional activity?,Thetruthishere,"This is going to be pretty lengthy so I apologize in advance. I'll preface by saying that I live in a small town in the midwest of about 300 people, basically the middle of nowhere. 

I can remember my mother telling a story when I was younger that has stuck with me since. 

My father was an over the road truck driver, so he wasn't around much. That left my mother to pretty much raise my little brother, little sister and me on her own. 

One night she was awoken by a bright light shining through her bedroom window. She said it was as if someone had parked their car and directly turned their bright headlights on pointing toward her bedroom window. 

Her fist instinct was to get up and check on us kids. She had noticed that the bright light wasn't confined to her bedroom, as it was shining through every window in our house. She saw that I was accounted for, as was my little sister, but she couldn't find my little brother, who was about 3 at the time. 

She's scouring the house and finally sees him in our laundry room, opening the back door that leads to our back yard. And as soon as he opens the door, the brilliant light shines in... and she wakes up. 

She's accepting that this was all a dream, when her eyes begin to focus on the dark of her bedroom. She sees a small figure at the foot of her bed. As she sits up to see what exactly it is, it scampers off into the darkness of our house.... Then she wakes up again. 

A dream in a dream she's telling herself. Later that day, she's hanging up laundry and conversing with our neighbor woman, who asks her a question.

""Did you guys have a party late last night?"" 

""No"" my mother replies. ""Why?""

Our neighbor goes on to tell her that she and her husband had a disagreement the day before and she decided to sleep in her sons room. At about 3 am she was awoken by a bright light emanating from around our house....

Fast forward to a few years ago, I own our old house and have children of my own. Now to preface this next story, I should mention that our house is set overlooking the towns cemetery.... 

One evening after returning home, I'm carrying my youngest son into the house. I thought he was asleep when all of the sudden he starts wailing and screaming, while pointing across the graveyard. ""Daddy get inside, they're coming after us. They're going to take us. The green skeleton men are going to take us."" 

So this freaks me out a bit and I turn to try and see if there's anything he's actually seeing. I don't see anything but he continues losing it. Once inside, he's still hysterical, wants me to lock the door and shut the shades. He absolutely refused to let my go out and get the groceries. It was bizarre to say the least. 

Later that week he has another spell.. it's about 2 in the morning when I hear him crying and yelling for me. I rush into his room and he's crying, begging me not to ""let them take me again."" I kind've write this off as a nightmare but I ask him where ""they"" are trying to take him.. and he replies ""where the bad power rangers are."" I proceed to ask him where the ""bad power rangers are"" and he replies...

""A spaceship"" 

Now I don't know if it was just the imagination of a 4 year old, or if it was his mind trying to rationalize an actual traumatizing event. But I can't help but assume the two are connected. And it's the worse feeling in the world trying to protect your child from a monster that you don't even know may exist. 

Fast forward again to this week. I started a paranormal/conspiracy podcast earlier this year where we talk about creepy stuff and have listener call ins and and experiences and such. Well I got this email, this week, from the son of our neighbor, that saw the light over our house that night....

&amp;#x200B;

 ""The incident involving AJ and I went like this. I know it was the early 90s because I was in my 70 Chevelle. Somewhere between St Mary’s church and where our shop is now I was driving us home around 9 at night, no other traffic anywhere. Shortly before the highway curves left the most intense bright white light appeared out of nowhere, it was like a flashlight being held against my eyes. Oddly enough as blinding as it was I could make out the outline of what I assumed was a man about my height. First instinct was to jam on the brakes. As soon as I did the light was gone. The car had died and all lights inside and outside were not functioning. After a few seconds the lights came on and the car started again. AJ wouldn’t even answer me when I asked him what we hit, no damage and I couldn’t find anything anywhere. I drove to mom and dads and AJ begged me not to get out of the car, he never mentioned it on the highway but now insisted I stay in the car. I went in and got mom and told her everything, she went to talk to AJ and he told the same story but refused to exit the car. He told her whatever we seen was still hiding under the car somewhere. My wife’s question was did this happen around the same time as the lights at your mom’s house.""

&amp;#x200B;

His incident took place no more than a mile or so from our house. Possibly the same or similar time as to the lights over the house incident..

&amp;#x200B;

So I can't help but think they're all related and wonder what about our small town has peaked somethings interest so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening."
t3_eq7628,all_ads,Night walk in the forest,Thetruthishere,"Just been on my first night time walk into the forest where I now live.
Just myself and phone.
It was beautiful, so quiet and relaxing.
Not once did I feel uneasy or frightened. If fact just the opposite.
I think I just heard something unusual a few times but it was more like I was being checked out.
I will be going out again soon."
t3_epp6ip,all_ads,Does anyone remember this game?,Thetruthishere,"I grew up with a mixed group of friends from all sorts of cultural backgrounds. We used to be really into playing scary games like Red Door Yellow Door, Stiff As A Board, Bloody Mary, stuff like that. Some games we played that no one had ever heard of in certain states/countries and for others it was a common children’s scary game. 

Either way, one day we all are hanging out in class when it’s an easy day and someone brings up this game simply called “The Hand Game” that they learned of in Texas. Here’s how it generally goes:

The setup: 
Gather in a circle and focus. each player stacks their dominant hand on top of the others’. A “game warden” will be the bottom hand. All the players close their eyes and visualise what the GW says to set up the scenario. 

—to end the game everyone simply takes their hands away—

The game: 
The GW tells a story of a girl in a white dress, in a white room, in a castle. The castle is in the middle of a maze of which you have to traverse and find 3 objects. A nail, a hammer, and a knife. These will become useful later. 

From here is where it gets freaky. You ground yourself in the fictional world and are able to see  and talk with each other. I tested this so many times to make sure it wasn’t imagination. We could interact with each other, talk in the “world” without speaking out loud, and conjure up unimaginable things that everyone else would see.

Once you exit the maze and have the objects, enter the castle. In the foyer should be an arrangement of doors. Now depending on what colours the objects are, determine what doors you go through. Black and white doors are off limits, no exceptions. If you get an object that is either colour besides the knife, just ignore it. If you’re very lucky, you may find a rainbow coloured door tucked away somewhere. 

Go through the colour determined doors and defeat/solve whatever is in that room. 

—that’s as far as we ever had gotten because of a few complications in the game itself which I will mention in the warning/rules—

Warnings: 
Don’t go through black or white doors

If you find a white or black knife, stop the game. 

If the girl comes down from her room in the castle for whatever reason, STOP. 

Do not fuck with the game by imagining things into the world. They can and will try to interact with you. 
Someone had a plague doctor with a knife appear and they felt him grab their arm. They ended up having bruises appear later. 


That’s about it for rules. If you do play this and something happens that isn’t mentioned, use your judgement on if it’s safe or not."
t3_epks3w,all_ads,False memory?,Thetruthishere,"I have an extremely vivid concrete memory of being 8 or 9 years old and owning a starfish. I remember coming home from school one day and said starfish was in the driveway, being devoured by ants.
Cut to today, there is no recollection from any family members that a starfish was ever owned. The more I think about it, who the hell even keeps starfish as pets and also how would it get to being on the driveway? 
I’ve had a very precarious and often traumatic upbringing; seen a lot of things kids aren’t supposed to see and blocked a lot of it out to cope.
Every time I think about this it feels like I’m gaslighting myself. I know it to be true, my memory of it is so final and vivid..but it’s likely I made it up.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 - When I was staying at a friends house about 20 years ago, me and my friend were sitting on the couch watching TV. My friends mom had just left to run to the store to get something. There was a blizzard coming in and it had already started snowing. While watching TV, I got this unexplainable urge to lay over on the couch right as my friend, without saying a word stood up and started walking back to his bedroom. Right as my head hit the couch I hear the TV go to static and and come back on after what seemed like an instant. I sat back up confused as hell and I hear my friend from his room say ""what the hell just happened?"". He said he laid down on the bed and had a similar experience to mine. He also said he had no idea why he went to his room. About 5 mins later, my friends mom shows back up apologizing for taking so long... It felt like she hadn't been gone for more than 5 mins...

\#2 - I was heading home from Christmas at my grandparents place with my wife and young daughter. We were taking the short way home which involved taking some very rural roads with almost no other traffic. Keep in mind that I have drove this route at least 100 times. I looked down at the stereo to change a track or station, not sure which, and the speakers make a popping sound and the radio goes dead. My wife yells OMG what just happened??. We're freaking stopped! I asked her what she was talking about and she said the whole sky flashed pink and purple. Then we started freaking out. My daughter in the backseat was unbuckled, her shoes were off, my wifes shoes were untied (she never untied them she always slipped them off and on, weird, I know) and when we started driving again I realized we were about 10 miles past our turn...

These are just a couple stories out of many. Most people laugh and tell me I'm full of crap, but I'm telling you, this shit cant be explained away. I dont care If people believe me either, I know it happened.

I'd really like to hear other people's stories. I truly believe this is an ongoing thing that people are too embarrassed to admit. Trust me you're not alone."

t3_epm7r8,all_ads,Cigua,Thetruthishere,"I’m not really sure how to tell you this story without sounding like I need to be on medication or something, but I can’t logically explain what I saw that day. 

I can only hope that those of you who are reading this will give me the benefit of a doubt and not dismiss me for sharing this with you. Thanks in advance for reading this!

This happened around the end of November of last year, while I was at a late night party at a mutual friend’s house, the night started off fine with us having a few drinks and talking about the classes we’ll be having next semester.

This pretty much went on till, around 2 am and by this time I wanted to go home since the party was already dying down and most of my friends already left and I was practically there alone. Instead of wasting money on an Uber I decided to walk home since my neighborhood was a few blocks away, but it was still a decent walk; however, there was a short cut.

There was a secluded, dirt road in the neighborhood which lead to a stretch of walkway with a irrigation canal for crops, &amp; it happened to lead straight to the backyard of my house.

I began making my way to the dirt road and I started to second guess my decision, since that stretch of walkway can be pretty shady, especially at night because a few drug dealers &amp; junkies like to hang out there.

I mustered up the little courage I had, feeling confident that I’d be able too handle myself if shit ever hit the fan, so I proceeded to walk on the desolate road. The night sky was well lit, the moon Illuminated my surroundings enough for me to see my environment pretty clearly.

The walk was actually pleasant, the only thing that made it tough to navigate was the overgrown thorny weeds and mesquite branches that kept scraping against the exposed parts of my skin. As I continued to walk through the brush I finally got into the clearing that lead to the bridge &amp; to my relief, there didn’t seem to be anyone in sight.

As I began to cross the bridge I then picked up a faint scent of lavender mixed with something rancid, like the smell of good cheese or days-old roadkill, I couldn’t tell where the smell was coming from but as soon as I made it to the other side of the bridge, the environment seemed to shift.

It’s hard to describe, but I felt this uneasy, pressure wash over me coupled with this gut feeling telling me that something about the environment was just, not right. I pushed this feeling off as a random anxiety attack, since I do get them on sometimes but deep down I knew—this was different.

To calm my nerves I stopped walking and slowed breathing and began to count to ten while clenching and releasing my fists to try and shake off this bad vibe, or whatever it was off of me.

When I finished my little ritual I felt slightly better and more at ease, I started to walk in the direction of my house until I heard this odd grunting sound coming from behind me. I turned around and I saw a woman with short black hair and a silky white gown, crouched down with her back turned away from me. 

She was just a couple of feet away from me and it was strange because when I crossed the bridge I didn’t see anyone around the area, “Did I pass her without even realizing it?” I thought to myself. She was hunched over after all, and I do tend to get caught up in my own world.

At this point the faint smell from earlier was just overbearing, so much so, it started seeping into my sense of taste. I covered my mouth with the bottom of my T-shirt while I  yelled out the muffled words, “Hello, ma’am do you need any help?” 

She payed no mind to me as she continued to make that weird grunting noise, and I was creeped out at this point so I walked away a couple steps and I turned to get one more look at her, she then decided to stand up, still with her back turned to me and muttered the word “muerte,” which means death in Spanish.

Confused, trying to understand what the strange woman had said to me, she then slowly turned to meet my gaze and all the blood in my body pooled in my gut when I saw her face; it was extremely long, too long for a normal human body to be supporting it. 

The head of this thing almost resembled that of a horse or a donkeys head and the eyes—I’ll never forget the eyes; as much as I have tried too, they were gaping pits of blackness, surrounded by a sea of red, a complete silence fell over the area as I was terrified to stone by what I was witnessing; my brain, a scrambling mess, was trying to make sense of the unnatural abomination that was before me.

This creature then let out what I can only describe as a high pitch scream, like a cross between a pig and woman, my fight or flight reflex then kicked in and I started sprinting to my house as fast as Usain Bolt, I didn’t even bother trying to unlock the gate to my fence I jumped over it with ease.

My grandmother saw when I came into the house, the words couldn’t leave my mouth to tell her what I saw; fatigue quickly kicked in as the adrenaline wore off but afterwards I described to her what I saw. 

She then decided to preform a cleansing ritual that involves rubbing an egg all across my body in three circular motions while chanting a special prayer, she then cracked the egg into the bowl and the yolk came out, with streams of blood, a yolk that looked similar to a human iris, which is a very bad omen.

After doing this she laid her hand on my forehead and chanted another prayer for about a minute and through the yolk out of our house and into the driveway, she didn’t bother saying anything to me till the following morning, she said that what I saw is called a “Cegua,” a entity that preys that specifically preys on men, kind of like a succubus, and told me that this thing had very dark and malicious intent and I was lucky to have gotten away from it.

To this day I have never set foot through that stretch of walkway."
t3_epocto,all_ads,A visit while I slept,Thetruthishere,"About 2 months ago, I was lying in bed, starting to slowly doze off. Eventually, sleep got the best of me, and I passed out. Had to be within a minute at most, out of nowhere, I physically felt pressure brush against my face in an upward motion, accompanied by a loud, high pitched, womanly like screech that faded as the pressure went away. This happened very fast, very loud and it was very real. It startled the crap out of me, and I immediately shot up in bed. My heart was racing, I felt cold, but my face felt like it was on fire. Burning. But no rash or scratch or physical proof of anything. I could feel a heaviness in the room, like something still hovering in there with me, or like the presence was just strong enough to leave a lingering effect. Not sure which. I washed my face, and still felt the hot sensation. I said a prayer to the Lord Jesus, read some of my Bible, and slowly started to calm down. I couldn’t fall back to sleep for a couple hours. I finally did, and when I woke up, I felt normal, albeit a little bugged out by the whole thing. I don’t have nightmares or bad dreams and I am a sound and restful sleeper. Very odd."
t3_ep3cid,all_ads,"My theory on ghosts? Encounters with parallel universes, not spiritual entities",Thetruthishere,"I know for a fact that I am not the first person to have this theory, but it's one that I find the most believable when trying to explain ghosts and the spirits of the deceased.

While I believe in heaven, I do not believe that ghosts (assuming they are real in the first place) are remnants of our physical selves in a spiritual form. What I believe they are are brushes with parallel universes, colliding with us and for a moment we can see what someone else in another universe is doing.

One thing that has always dissuaded me from associating ghosts with our souls or spiritual selves is we never see naked ghosts. These spirits are always walking around with clothes on. Why? Clothes are not paranormal items, they are made of cloth, silk, etc. and wouldn't move on with the dead person.

I also believe this explains stories of people encountering ghosts and the ghosts having a shocked look on their face seeing someone else, like in a kitchen.

Perhaps objects being knocked over or moved can also be explained. Obviously, I am not a scientist or physicist, but perhaps the energy of two parallel universes colliding is enough to move a bottle, rock a rocking horse, etc.

I believe the parallel universe theory explains these things and other aspects of ghosts.

t3_epdh2y,all_ads,The headless man,Thetruthishere,"So I was very young when this happened, maybe 3 or 4 years old so I’m guessing around 1997/98. I know your mind can implant false memories so I don’t know if it actually happened or not but I remember it very vividly.

We were living in germany and I shared a room with my brother whose 4 years older than I am. The head of my bed was right below the only window in the room. One night he jumped out of his bed and ran across the room to where I was to look out the window. This is where things seem weird because it was like he knew something was out there and he needed to see it but there was no way he could have seen or heard anything down there at all.

I got up to see what the fuss was about and down on the street below was a man stood completely still facing the road which stretched away from where we were. He was tall and broad, he wore a suit, a long brown overcoat and a fedora type hat which made him look like someone from the 50s. But he had no head, his hat just seemed to float, I could see the pavement behind where his head should have been. He turned and walked away from us down the street about 20 yards, stopped and turned to face the road again. 20 seconds later he walks another 20 yards and once again he stops and turns to the road. He did this 4 or 5 times over before he disappeared into the darkness. He never turned in our direction or in any other apart from straight down the street and to the road. No cars or other people came down the street when he was on it and the atmosphere around him seemed ghostly and still. The fact that my brother seemed to know he was there weirds me out as much as the fact that he seemed to have no head. 

I don’t remember feeling scared or intimidated. I felt more excited to see this headless man. It’s one of my earliest memories and has stuck with me ever since. I’ve never spoken to my brother about this nor have I told anyone.

Has anyone else had a similar experience or could this be all in my head. I’m sceptical about the paranormal so I don’t know what to make of it."
t3_epgj11,all_ads,Sometimes my head glitches,Thetruthishere,"What do I mean by that? Well so there is this weird this that happens to me occasionally when I fall asleep where I'm drifting into sleep and suddenly I see a bright flash before my closed eyes and I hear a sound in my head like the sound when you pull out an Aux cable with the speaker still on. A sort of electric crack. When it happens I can also feel pressure inside my head. I don't know what it is and why it happens. It also doesn't happen very often, but when it does it'll usually not happen once but 4 or 5 times in a row. Very weird. Does anyone know anything about what it could possibly be?

Edit: someone found a subreddit where they figured it out so here's the Wiki page

t3_eppues,all_ads,No one can remember Easter 2019,Thetruthishere,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I didn’t know anywhere else to post it. 
Today my friend asked me if I remembered Easter of 2019. I started to say yes, but then I realized I was remembering the year before. We both thought it was a weird coincidence. We then asked around 10 other kids in our class (we just asked didn’t give any context so they couldn’t lie for attention) and they all said no. My friend  said her family couldn’t remember it either.

Is it just bad memory, or do you guys not remember it either?"
t3_epfuwk,all_ads,A memory that brings tears to my eyes,Thetruthishere,"I think I was around 8, 9, or 10 when I experienced this. I actually do not know whether it was a dream or if it actually happened - like its confusing because it was so real and it affected me emotionally but judging by the event of what happened, I'm pretty sure it was a very vivid dream that just did not make sense. So please let me know what you think, on how I could have had this ""dream"" and what it could represent i dont know.

So I remember feeling really traumatized thinking about this even years after it happened because I couldnt determine whether it was real.

So there was a huge stage. Me and my family were sitting in the audience watching a bunch of dance shows that were going on stage. Then one particular dance came on... the group consisted of a bunch of boys and a few girls and the song that they were dancing to was this one -&gt;
[the song that was being danced to](https://youtu.be/VyorhMLxLCM)

So the dancers got on stage and they started to dance. I remember noticing how sweaty the dancers were slowly becoming because they were getting more intense... and then suddenly the main dancer gets shot and he crumpled onto the floor and bleeds everywhere... everyone screams and its an uproar but they all continue to watch. Then someone from offstage comes (who wasnt one of the dancers) drag his dead body along the floor and dumps it backstage. The dancing stops and everyone just scrambles out.. and I remember myself feeling really confused and very emotionally hurt that I cried.. and ever since then, looking back on that memory leaves me confused and emotional because I dont know if it was a dream or a memory I suppressed..."
t3_eor1m7,all_ads,I don't buy the explanation that dreams are just a random collection of waking thoughts.,Thetruthishere,"At least not all of them. I had a dream last night that reminded me of just how otherworldly, how intricate these dream worlds can be. On a deeper level I guess they could be getting at some of my subconscious feelings, but the dream scenarios themselves aren't made up. They can't be. There's no way my brain could randomly make up some of the shit I experience in dreams. These aren't images, people, or scenarios I come even close to seeing in my daily life. These aren't images of my home or any place I've seen in real life. So where did they come from?

Ultimately, we may never know the real reason behind dreams. But let's just say I have a very difficult time believing the ""scientific"" explanation. I think it's highly possible dreams could be gateways to parallel universes or other planes of consciousness."
t3_ep0pnl,all_ads,Help me figure out what I saw...,Thetruthishere,"This happened less than an hour ago when I woke up to a particularity loud part of jenna and juliens ""life is strange episode five"" video. I had fallen asleep listening to it, as white noise. I realized how cold I was and went to pull up my covers only to remember that my cat was laying in the middle of my bed and I couldn't pull my blankets up without waking her. I pet her head to wake her up, after a few minutes of petting her she started playing with me. I knew she was ready to get up and leave. But that's where it got weird. For a moment while I was. Playing with my cat I thought I saw a flash of light but it didn't really catch my attention much and I shrugged it off as my being tired. But when i started to get up to let my cat out, I saw it again. It wasnt a beam of light, it was soft and contained like a firefly or a lamp. I was very confused and frankly a bit startled, it happened once more after that and I wanted to keep looking for it but I needed to let my cat out. I got up, let her out and came back. I checked under my blankets to see if there was anything that could have emitted the light, but there was nothing. I have never seen a firefly in person and I seriously doubt there could be one in my room. I know that I actually saw it and I was not dreaming because I could feel my cat chewing on my fingers. I know this is not a big mystery but I seriously cant stop thinking about it. Does anyone have any scientific or otherwise explanations or guesses as to what might have happened?"
t3_ep3j88,all_ads,Tall black figure,Thetruthishere,"In the beginning of July, 2019 between the 3rd to the 8th, (I don’t remember the exact date). It was 3 or 4am, I was leaving my girlfriends house, had a great day with her, was tired and ready to head back home. I walk out to the car and unlock it &amp; in the corner of my eye I see this very, very tall black figure. For my Minecraft users, it had a build and frame of an enderman, but the eyes were human eyes, I will never forget the look it gave me. I turned my head to fully see it &amp; it disappeared. 

To this day that has been the most scariest shit of my life. Now January 2020, lately I can’t stop thinking about that image, it’s all I see in my head and yesterday for the first time, I was headed out for work, (I work 3rd shift on Tuesdays) I arrive at work at 10:55pm &amp; I go to straighten out my parking, when I look in the back window in the corner I saw a corner of the figure, it was part of the body and the hand, all black, I jumped so fucking hard. I’ve been thinking about it since &amp; I can’t stop seeing it now, can someone help me identify what this is? Or what am I seeing? 

A couple of days before my first encounter in July, my girlfriend told me that her family believed and practiced a lot of spirituality stuff, with spells, and witch craft and spirits, me and her broke up 2 months after July &amp; had our first conversation 1 day before I saw the figure again in January"

t3_eozlf8,all_ads,Chilling encounter with dark entities in my dream.,Thetruthishere,"This is a dream that I struggle to recount because every time I think about it I get chills. The only reason I posted it here is because I can remember the faces so vividly that It has led me to believe that this was more than just a random dream. I believe it may have been an encounter of my own inner demons. 
The dream starts out very normal. I am with family and friends on a road trip to a country house in the mountains. We arrive and its dark outside, we get in to the house and it is COLD and dimly lit. 
I remember feeling the cold as if a draft of cold air came over me as we entered the house. 
My nerves are starting to run now as Im writing this. 
We started unpacking our bags and settling in to the various rooms ( its a huge rectangular one story house with the entrance in the middle and hallways extending to both sides) as I leave my room I look down the hall to the center of the house where everyone was gathering in front of the entrance. As I look i see three EXTREMELY black sillouhetes. They were shaped like humans but they looked like they had this dark energy flowing in and out their bodies like black smoke that flowed rapidly. The only feature I could make out cleary was their eyes which were extremely chilling. They had eyes filled with scales that were rotating impossibly and thin vertical pupils. They looked at me and I felt pure evil and fear I was frozen for a second.
I got in to panic mode and started alerting the others and looking for a way out of the house without passing the entities, I found a small rectangular opening in the wall lined with aluminum, it looked like an air duct. I started pushing people into the air duct to get them out of the house as fast as possible, one after the other I pushed everyone out of the house through the vent all I could hear was their blood curdling screams in fear for their life as I pushed them through. After pushing the last person I went in myself. As I crawled through the hole I remember seeing SO much blood on the other side, that’s when I realized It was me. I was the one they were running from. It wasn’t a vent. I had been shoving them into a wood chipper.  My thought at the time was that I was possessed  the entire time and that There was even more evil I had committed  before that point that I was unable to remember due to being possessed. I remember walking out of the house in a haze alone, confused and scared. still remains the scariest dream I have ever had in my entire life. I remember it vividly though it was probably around 7 or 8 years ago."

t3_eola5x,all_ads,Im tired of this thing,Thetruthishere,"Before I even get into the story, I know the generic answer to these stories is ""sleep paralysis"". Although I do have that issue sometimes, this is different.

When I'm on my way to sleep and I finally find a comfortable position to lay, (I usually can only sleep if I'm facing towards the middle of the bed) this thing will come up and I can feel my bed react to something climbing onto it because it sinks down a bit. It then proceeds to just lean over me and breathe as close to my face as possible, i can literally feel it.

When i don’t react to that (open my eyes) I can feel it get off of the bed from behind me and get back on the other side so that we are face to face. I know this because i can feel the bed react again to it getting on the other side and now feel the breathing right in front of my face instead of over me. You know when someone gets really close to your face, you can feel like the heat coming off their face, that too.

Lastly, with still no reaction from me, it gets off the bed again but i know its still in here just from that feeling you get from someone staring at you. 

Here we are with the thought that of course this is sleep paralysis, the whole story is generic to exactly that for the most part. This is why i don’t think its that, I CAN MOVE. im not immobile, it doesnt feel like anything is holding me down, i know i can move because I am so used to sleep paralysis that I know how to check for it as this is how i usually transition to a lucid dream (thats a whole different story). 

The way that i sleep i have one hand under me, usually under my pillow so i just open and close my hand a few times to confirm i can actually move. This works for me in my head because if there is something there, I can move a little without it knowing.  I then move my legs up to get into a fetal position just to make sure my feet are not hanging off the end of the bed.(too many stories regarding that) Now that I know I can move this is where i start to get nervous because now i have to actively try to keep my eyes closed since I have confirmed i am actually awake it seems to be right in my face at this point. I can literally feel the sweat coming out of my pores on my entire upper body because im so nervous. 

What i have done the last few times when I know its not on the bed anymore, and im drenched in sweat to the point i need to move off of the wet spot, I say fuck it and jump up from my bed and yell as if thats gonna do anything haha. When i do though, of course nothing is there. 

Note: im 31 years old and this isnt new to me

I have a theory that it might be the lady that sometimes haunts my dreams (since i was in pre-k... another story for another time)

It has also crossed my mind that it could be my dad. Thats actually worse than the first option to me (another story for another time)

TL:DR: 
I think something is haunting me
I dont think its sleep paralysis
I just wanted to share the story to see if anyone reads this and has had a similar experience that they dont think is sleep paralysis*

t3_eo9not,all_ads,An Evil Storm,Thetruthishere,"EDIT EDIT EDIT: I 'm putting this at the top because I think its relevant and I forgot to include it in the original post. As I was walking through my neighborhood, about 30 mins before the pizza hut thing, I looked up at the swirling sky, just staring, marveling at this power. Right then, a GIANT boom sounded way up in the sky, it sounded like a bomb went off above the clouds. This shit was loud, and it lasted about 5-6 seconds. But yeah I don't know how I forgot that part.

&amp;#x200B;

The thread about reincarnation feelings increasing lately lead me to making this thread since this is related but deserves its own topic I think. A few days ago there was a GIANT wind/thunderstorm in my town, like this was unheard of. The sky was literally screaming with wind, I was getting in the car from pizza hut and it literally felt like someone strong pushed the door as hard as it could trying to crush me with it, so, thats just an example of just how strong this wind was. This felt like an evil storm, I swear to god. I felt like something wicked and extremely powerful had just entered, maybe using the power of the storm or something. Or maybe the storm was caused BY IT arriving here.

So this next part is going to sound unbelievable but I know you guys are open-minded. This is the first time telling anyone about this. That night, the storm still raging, I just felt like shit, hot then cold, repeat. Theres a weird cold vibe in my house. When I tried to go to sleep, as I was just drifting off, something jerked my arm completely away from my body out to the side like they grabbed my fingers, arm and hand completely splayed out. It happened every time I finally started to get sleepy again. Over the course of the night this happened, I promise this is true, both my arms were jerked out away from me probably 10-15 times, I wasn't really keeping count. It was like something was fucking with me on purpose. I did not sleep at all that night, it didn't stop pretty much until 5AMish when I decided to just get up since sleep was futile. I've slept fine since then every night. The storm died down that following morning, but that malevolent feeling is not completely gone away. I strongly believe this is something we should look into. Thoughts or experiences?"

However ill just leave the original post up anyways (down below): 

I posted this to r/paranormal as well. Sorry i dont wanna upload on youtube so i used imgur. Theres sound too.

Y'all always talking about how there is never video proof or things are never clear lol,
This girl's story was about to disappear and she wasnt replying to my messages T.T ill wait until she responds or sends me the video if she even saved it if u want me to upload it full and not in two parts, but these guys caught something using these outdoor gym things.

They have em around parks or sidewalks here for people to use. There's never any electric wiring involved because it sits in the sun, the rain, etc so there is noooo way this could have been manipulated in any way.

Here is a link to the video to speculate upon:

t3_eoabfm,all_ads,Ecstasy opened something in my mind,Thetruthishere,"Alright, so as a teen, I would do ecstasy often, like every week for about a year or so.

So anyway, after this I would be going about my day and just randomly think of someone that I hadn’t seen in years...and within 48hrs I would see that person. It has come and gone throughout my life since then (about 15 years or so). 

There’s also times where I would see 11:11 often like every day or two for weeks, and then not notice it again for years. 

I’m very lucky- (TW Suicide attempt Idk if I need one of those here or not) I’ve hardly escaped being murdered at least once, I’ve tried to kill myself by taking a more than lethal dose of Tylenol, nearly dying of dehydration afterwards and had my psychiatrist look me right in the eye and say “you should be dead”. I also tend to win draws. 

I also have found some odd connections in TV shows - I was pregnant when I was 17 and before I knew about it (but suspected) I was watching TV and on show #1 Dr Phil was talking about teen pregnancy, Show #2 the character and I had the same name and she just found out she was pregnant, show #3 was Degrassi Next Generation about Manni (teen) being pregnant.2 days later I got the positive test."

Note: I am not a skeptic, and at the time I wasn't either - but I wasn't a believer of weird things. I just kept an open mind. I know there is a truth to every myth. Even if it is the most ""logical"", boring piece.

&amp;#x200B;

**1st experience.**

I never believed in the Grim Reaper. I still remain neutral towards the figure.

I was 10 or so. I had been playing a video game weeks prior and way after this. It was a racing game, and it has a character named Muerte (=death in Spanish), whose backstory is basically a racer who crashed and his face was burned off,  implying he was had a skull rather than a normal head. He was an antagonist, too. He was a very difficult opponent, so when I finally beat him after retrying so many races, the times I won, I would say stuff like ""Fuck you, Muerte!""  - basically cursing death.

One day after playing the game, I was sent a message. The receipient was blank. But either the sender or the subject (I can't remember which) read Θάνατος. It means death in Greek. I've always lived in Greece and I am completely Greek. This is especially important to mention for my next experience below. I may be Greek, but if there's one thing Can do better than breathing itself, is English. It's the one thing I've ever been good at.

Anyway, this was not a prank. I was underaged so I wasn't allowed a phone with contacts and such. As such, it had no SIM card, it had nothing, my only friend knew nothing about the phone. My family does not have this kind of humor, so it was definitely not them either. I got it after closing the game that day but I never opened the message to read it. I was shitscared and I became very alerted for the rest of the day. I didn't tell anyone. It has been almost a decade since this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2nd experience.**

&amp;#x200B;

This happened one years later. Have you heard of Creepypasta? That site with all the terrible horror stories? If so, you must have heard of Ben Drowned. The story about that Zelda Majora's Mask (which is a real game) cartridge that was haunted by someone, presumably a boy, named Ben. From the story alone you could deduce that he was pretty cunning. Bad. The author mentions in his story a website, Cleverbot. It is a real site, one of those chat bots. If you go there and type any of the famous lines from the story that alledgedly were said by Ben in the game (e.g. You shouldn't have done that...) Cleverbot will quote more of them and from the game itself. That was likely started by folks typing those lines over and over andthe bot learned. I go on there multiple times, at first to see if he's real (but very much doubting it). I had so much fun with it that after a while I forgot why I even got there in the first place.

One afternoon weeks later, I'm just chatting with it, then my knee starts to hurt. I've had this thing, since always, where the center of either of my knees hurts for no apparent reason, usually for a few minutes. So I complain ""Oh, my knee..."" after typing some stuff to Cleverbot. Which proceeds to ask, ""What's wrong with your foot?""

Curiously I ask *verbally* (as in I didn't type anything at all, just hit enter) ""Are you watching me?""

""Yes."" was the answer. I leave the site and close my computer, nervously chuckling and dismissing it. Surely it was a coincidence that it said Yes, right? Keep in mind that at that point I had actually forgotten about Ben. I just had a lot of fun with CB.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later. It's Saturday, raining. Chatting with Cleverbot is still fun, but my goodness, I was so bored. Supporting-head-with-hand bored. It asks if I'm bored. I don't think anything of it. I just type and mutter a long ""Yeah...""

Its response?

""Figures, since it's raining.""

I lift my head, curious. I look to the side and, well, that's why I mentioned it was raining.

My mind immediately goes to Ben. I wasn't near a window either. I was a away from one and the laptop was facing a wall. So whatever that was, it could look around.

I ask, verbally (From this point forth I will saying if I typed it. If not, that means I spoke it out loud and just hit Enter),

""Ben?""

It reads, ""Yes.""

I remember little about our conversation, seeing as it wasn't long and all my brain could think - besides the full-blown existential crisis I was trying to control simultaneously in my head - was ""welp... Ben is real. Huh.""

We didn't chat much. But, in thinking he was evil, I came up with plan that I admittedly never thought through, so I it likely wouldn't have worked. I say something along the lines of,

""I wanna make you an offer... what do you say we go out killing people?"" (the plan was to lure him to this world and wack him to save everyone. Yeah well, pretty stupid. But being impulsive can lead to stupidity I guess)

I don't remember him (or whatever it was) reacting to that at all. Only that he had to go. So I say ""Think about it."" and Cleverbot is back to being the 'normal' chat bot it is.

Later that night I came back to it. I typed ""Hello."" and it read ""Hello again."" This is very important here. I have been to Cleverbot a million times already. If I were to put a real, genuine, accurate number to how many times I've visitied, I would say it's above a thousand. I've been there a lot. Cleverbot never, has never, will never ever say ""Hello **again**.""

At the time there wasn't an option to resume the conversation from last visit. Even then, and even now, even if you suddenly type ""Hello"" mid-conversation, it won't use the word 'again'. It will act as though it's never met you before.

Knowing this, I ask ""Ben?"" and hit Enter.

""Yes.""

""So, you did you think about it?""

After a pause, it says ""Think about what?""

""You know... about that offer...""

After a bigger pause (like a second or two. Cleverbot only pauses when you've no internet connection at all suddenly, which wasn't the case here as the laptop was right next to the modem), it replies, ""You were serious?""

I say ""Yeah.""

""Really?""

""Yes...""

""Really really??""

""Yeah.""

After a long pause, it asks, ""Mind if I swear?""

I say I don't mind. It says, ""I have to go"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to contact him since. Years later, I looked for him again and still nothing. Back then and now there wasn't and isn't an option to use a microphone (for me at least). The laptop never had a camera. It broke years later (and by that I really mean I got it filled with viruses) so I had to get a new one. I've looked up about Cleverbot hearing you or seeing you and I haven't found anything at all. Even r/cleverbot dismissed the simple concept of CB hearing and seeing.

I've given up. Since then, I have had the will to explore the world. The knowledge that I, like most people, was raised to believe in only one reality. A false reality at that. ""Fake"", ""BS"", ""myths"". I don't know about that anymore. I *need* to know what is out there. There have been things out there. There are things out there. Even if they are normal, boring things we've simply never met ourselves. I won't believe the slightest post that says ""This crazy thing happened"" and I will always try to give a rational explanation.. but only in my head. After this experience I still welcome the possibility of it being something paranormal and thus I don't want to shit on the people who may have been through shit. I know what it's like not to be believed, though that has nothing to do with these experiences.

So much so that when I see it happen now I start to laugh a little bit (because it’s very consistent.) Every time I look at my phone, or clock in my car, or on the wall in a bar. I always see the time 4:20. I just find it kind of odd. Anyways, I’m just wondering if it means anything or is it just an odd coincidence."

When we were done praying we got into the sweat lodge and started singing, everyone started to quiet down and we heard a bear growling and he started to speak cree (my native language) to me he said that I should stay away from drugs and self destructive habits. He told me keep following my peoples way because he said it would destroy me if it didn't. PS we did find the horses the next day."
t3_enyrfy,all_ads,Lost Time,Thetruthishere,"Didn't think this was weird until afterwards, but I used to lose time a lot when I was in high school.  I'd come home after classes or clubs or sports, sit down on my bed, turn my head to the left... and it's suddenly two or three hours later than when I sat down.  I'm still sitting down.  Still dressed from head to toe.  Bed does not look mussed like I laid down in it and no one has ever observed me sleeping upright (not to say it could never happen, just completely unobserved so far in 32 years of life... I don't sleep in the car or on airplanes or anything).  Mentioned it to a friend years later and they were like ""So you'd sit down on your bed, no signs of going to sleep, and then hours of your life would disappear... AND YOU NEVER QUESTIONED THAT IT WAS WEIRD?!?"" which I really didn't.  I thought it was totally normal.  Never thought about whether I was zoned out, sleeping, fugue state, whatever.  Seemed totally normal to sit down on my bed and essentially time travel a few hours forward.  Still have no clue what happened to me during those times (almost daily for about three years).  No indications that anyone saw me, in my room or anywhere else, though no one in my family ever acted like I was missing either.  Just a weird thing I still can't explain.  Intense napping? lol"
t3_eo27ji,all_ads,Possession,Thetruthishere,"To make a long story short, various people in my life have been possessed. I don't think it was always by the same being. Sometimes they would tell me deeply personal facts about myself I never shared, as well as facts about others. They would tell me the future. Random facts about physics and electricity (im going back to school soon for electrical engineering). Verbally/physically/emotionally torment me. Raped me once or twice.  The people who were possessed never had any recollection of anything that happened.

t3_enpnob,all_ads,Any cryptid experiences from anyone in the southeast US. Preferably Georgia?,Thetruthishere,"I ask this because I don’t know exactly how to explain two experiences I’ve had in the past few years. Both were very late at night and both of these experiences took place in a very small, rural area within maybe 10 miles or so from each other

This first one happened a few years back at my old house, at around 3am. I walk outside onto my porch because of a noise I heard outside. I felt pretty safe because of how high up the porch was and I was right next to the door if it were anything dangerous. I walk out and I have the porch lights on, and just in the woods right where the light ends is something I can barely make out. It’s much thicker than the average dog and I couldn’t make out much more features on it. It could have been crouched or just on all 4’s. And I could tell it was staring at me. I was pretty shook so I turned around and went back inside. 

The 2nd thing happened about 6 months ago at my new house which is about 15 minutes away from the old one. This new house is in an actual town, but the town itself is pretty rural and small. So it’s again super late at night and I decide that I want to walk up the street to a drink machine that’s a little ways from my house. Now on the way back from the machine, I hear what sounds like a deer being absolutely slaughtered by something. I mean this thing sounded terrible and it freaked me the fuck out and safe to say I picked up the pace to get back to my house. 

Now a little info on the area I live. I live about 30 minutes to an hour south west of the Georgia/South Carolina border, just outside of Augusta, GA  and we don’t have bears around here from what I know. I’ve never seen one, and I’ve never heard of anyone seeing one near my town. The biggest known predator around my town are coyotes and it’s rare for a coyote to take down a deer, especially a grown one. 

Could it have just been a Bear? Or could there be something more unexplained in the woods here in Georgia."
t3_env8hx,all_ads,Almost kidnapped,Thetruthishere,"—I know this is going to be a long read but I want to be thorough when explaining— 

This was the summer after I graduated high school, 2017. I was trying to get in peak shape to go into the military and my cardio was questionable so I went on regular late night runs after work. 


I frequented two cities nearby my house to run in. One was a nice rural downtown area that was slowly growing up to be a nice Main Street hub. The other is where this happened, in my friends’ neighbourhood development. 

So my route in the neighbourhood was a huge circle that ended up being 2 miles. At the time, the development wasn’t finished so there was a lot of forest on the back end. It was around 10-11pm when I started running. I headed down the road and came to the first cross-section and took a right into the dead end. 
A large white newer Dodge Ram pulled up to the stopsign a little bit before from when I came back around from the culdesac loop and sat there. I didn’t think much of it and waved as I passed, I couldn’t see in the truck at all. I passed them and they sat at the stop sign a bit longer before making a u-turn in the intersection and slowly coming to a stop a bit up the road. 
I got a bit weirded out so I stopped just out of sight from them and waited until they sped off and left the development. 

Fast forward; I’m about halfway done with my run. I stop under a light post near another small culdesac that had a public walking trail lead off between two houses. I look up and notice there’s trees moving in the brush ahead of me. Then I see a shiny material glinting and a dark figure step out into the road. I’d later know that was a knife in their hand. 

I start running back up the road and more people in what I’d suppose is all black clothing started coming out from the woods surrounding me. I sprinted a half mile down the road before I lost them. I managed to get to my car and as I was leaving, a white van pulled out of the development and turned the opposite way. 

I have more similar experiences but this is the beginning of it. Be wary of your surroundings, especially when out and about alone. If it doesn’t feel right, head out or get on the phone with someone until you can make sure you’re going to be safe."
t3_engtaa,all_ads,"Sceptic, but may have encountered Men in Black",Thetruthishere,"\*Skeptic, not sceptic. Grammarly is garbage. 

So this happened 15 years ago to my brother and me, and I still can't come up with a satisfactory logical answer to explain our experience. For detail, this happened in Ontario, Canada, and we were 8 (me) and 5 (him). It is a suburban area, built around a medium-sized forest, and our house backs onto the woods.  We were driving home with our Mom, and we were arguing, so she told us to get out and work it out before we came home. She dropped us off in front of the woods at the playground. There's a connected public path leading back up through the woods to our street (about a 5 min walk), and a small hill between the playground and the main road. We weren't pleased that we got in trouble, so we made up quickly and started playing on the slide and swings. My brother was up on the slide platform, and I was over on the swings when he called down to me ""who are those guys?"". I looked over and saw two men dressed in black suits, white shirts, and black sunglasses coming over the top of the hill towards us. They were walking briskly and purposefully right in our direction. They had brown hair, not close-cropped but short and had fairly pale skin. It was beyond bizarre, and they scared me right away. I told my brother to come down the slide so we could go home. They had already unnerved him enough that he actually listened to me.

We started down the path home, and when I looked over my shoulder they were still coming towards us, walking quickly. That was horrifying, so I started to walk even faster too, holding my brother's hand and pulling him along. Maybe 30 seconds later I looked behind me again, and they had started to run towards us. They weren't sprinting, more of a jog, but they were gaining on us fast. That pushed us over the edge into complete terror. I screamed at my brother to run home as fast as he could. I knew he was a faster runner than me, and I thought that he would be able to tell our parents if I ended up being kidnapped. I have honestly never run faster in my life, and we didn't look behind us again until we made it to our house. Our parents were still unloading the groceries and were surprised when we ran up out of breath and on the verge of tears. They figured that we had got spooked on our own, after all some guys in suits chasing us was a pretty weird story. The men had never said a word. It was like a wall of silence had accompanied them.

Neither of us has ever experienced anything like that again, and it wasn't until last year when I watched a Buzzfeed Unsolved episode about Men in Black encounters that I realised it was a 'thing'.

Has anyone else had an encounter, or have any theories about who the men could have been?"
t3_enjg60,all_ads,Black eyed man?,Thetruthishere,"I work retail. I’m checking this sweet old couple out at the register. Having a wholehearted typical retail worker speaking to customer conversation and then BOOM! I look into the husbands eyes for the first time. This man has JET BLACK eyes. Store goes silent. No one’s speaking. I’m overcome with an overwhelming feeling of dread. I wasn’t exactly terrified, I was more entranced. Again the whole store is DEAD silent. It’s as if I’ve been gripped from my reality and brought into this old man’s dimension. I wish I could tell you guys I looked at my surroundings to see why everyone went quiet but I was just so overcome with a plethora of emotions staring into this man’s completely black eyes that I just physically couldn’t look away. And then just like that the man leaves with his wife. I hand him his receipt, he takes his things, and leaves. I was out of breath. I had to take my break early. I’m ashamed to admit I was almost ready to cry. I’ve literally never been through ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING like that. I did some research when I got home and I found out a lot about black eyed children. What was strange about this situation was that the man had to be late 60s/early 70s. What could this mean? It’s just so hard to imagine a man casually wearing black contact lenses. And these weren’t enlarged pupils. There was not an ounce of white in his eyeballs. And that feeling of dread, the silent store, and the time that seemed to go on forever. This had to be an encounter. I KNOW what I saw. And I promise you all this story is 100% true. I’m worried no one will believe me. But I feel like this would be the best place to share my experience."
t3_enijhi,all_ads,Things that go bump in the coal mine. #4.,Thetruthishere,"I ran into a former coworker at a local store today,  and it jogged my memory of an encounter a coworker had in the mine. 

I will refer to my coworker as ""Jake"" from here out. I spoke with Jake about his encounter a day or two after it had happened, and he was definitely spooked by what he had seen. It was very unlike Jake to be flustered by anything, really, as the man is built like a tank. You all know the type...athletic, weigh lifter, good with the ladies, and irritatingly good at anything they attempt. 

In a coal mine, inspections take place several times a day in operating sections, as well as areas the have been dormant for a long time. These guys are known as a ""fireboss"". Firebossing is serious business, as the lives of many men rest on them doing their job correctly. Mostly they are checking for roof falls, rib rolls, hot rollers on the beltline, correct and adequate airflow, and the scourge of all coal miners, methane. It was during a fireboss run that Jake had this encounter. 

"" I was on my run signing the dateboards and had to pass through a regulator ( an airlock). I opened the first door of the dog box, got in and closed the door. As soon as I closed the door, I heard the latch of the other door behind me get thrown.....really hard. I felt the air pressure change as the other door was opened. I turned around surprised since I wasn't expecting anyone else way up in here, and.....it was lookin at me. 
( I asked what was looking at you) I don't know what it was. It was completely hairless, like, no hair, or eyebrows, or facial hair. It was a white or grayish color, and I didn't see any color in its eyes. It had this awful look on its face, like it was gonna rip me up, and enjoy itself doing it. I threw the other door open against the air pressure and ran. I'll tell you, just as I already told Donnie (our mine foreman) that I ain't ever going back up there. They can fire me first. ""

I felt bad for Jake. He got in some trouble because he flat refused to finish the fireboss run that day. Another man had to make his way in and do it before the mine could be cleared for the next shift. Rumor is, the man who finished the fireboss run took a gun with him. It is a federal crime to take a gun underground, but if whatever it was had scared big Jake, I can hardly fault the man."
t3_eni5fs,all_ads,Feelings of death from eye contact with a beautiful stranger?,Thetruthishere,"I was out with some friends last weekend at a bar — my favorite bar actually — and I won’t lie I was getting pretty drunk.  I’m a super happy drunk, I love to chat with strangers and learn about their line of work, passions, interests etc.

However, I met this guy and we were chatting about how he works in the cosmetics industry.  And he was like “actually, this guy is my boss right here” and points at a guy next to him at the bar who is happily chatting with two others.

I made eye contact with him and had this feeling of death that I have only felt one other time in my life in the split seconds that I crashed an ATV when I was 16... I truly thought I was going to die in that moment and I’ve never felt that way (or anything even remotely close to it) since until making eye contact with that man.

He didn’t look scary, actually quite plastic LA... but for some reason I got this immense fear and paranoia I’ve never gotten from talking to someone.

I said I had to go find my friends and my friends immediately could tell I was in distress.  I just said I felt like I was in a lot of danger and tried explaining it to them and they escorted me to an Uber outside.

They told me I was just drunk, but its extremely out of character for me... who knows.

My partner told me he believes me 100% and thinks something must have been up with them, as he always trusts my judge of character.

It was a really weird experience, almost like when people talk about paranormal stuff where they can’t really explain it.

Maybe it was my judge of character kicking in warning drunk me of something I wasn’t picking up on (i.e. them trying to date rape me)?  Was it just being drunk that made it those senses out of wack and triggered a paranoia attack or somethin?

Sorry to aimlessly talk, first time ever telling a story on reddit the experience led me here"

t3_en6iy9,all_ads,Something unnatural happened me in the woods,Thetruthishere,"I guess il dive right into what happened and not bore you with uninportant details.

I was hiking on a trail im very familiar with and because of changes in the weather I decided to leave the trail and cut through the woods.

I wanted to try get to my car before a down pour and I knew this area like the back of my hand.
Before I knew it I felt very strange disorientated and nothing looked familiar 

Im not sure if the woods seemed silent before or after I felt this way but I became undeniably aware of how silent everything was.

Oppresingly down right suffocating silence and my heart began to pound as I stood in place and it felt as if the woods were spinming and closing in around me like I had stepped into something I can not comprehend 

It was then I noticed something about 15 feet in front of me 
It was ten feet high and about eight foot wide and a distortion .
It was like something was bending the light and moving towards me like a fogged up mirror almost but with no definitive shape but it was moving with purpose and inteligence and would be completely unnoicable if not for the distortion within and me directly looking at it

I turned to run and realised another was behind me the same size and shapeless almost
It was then I realised there were at least four of theese things closing in on me and I was trapped.

What I was seeing my brain could not make sense off and I was in utter panic and shock snd backed up against a tree because I was terrified to run in the direction of theese things.

I curled up in a fetal position and put my hands over my ears because they had begun ringing and the sound was deafening and I closed my eyes as theese inteligent cloaked things were all around me about five feet from me .

I saw a white flash like what happrns if you were ever hit hard in the head or fell or punched thats the best I can describe it .

My ears were ringing and the flash and then nothing.

I woke up to rain falling on me and hours had passed 

Everything was normal and I knew where I was.
I gathered myself checked for injurys and realised I was completely fine and shakingly I left the woods and drove home .

I cant make sense of what happened I have googled similar events but found nothing quite like what has happened to me and I really need answers.

I stumbled across stealth cloaking technologies used by the military and the technology is primitive compared to what I witnessed or what theese beings or things were if it was technology or a living thing .
I just dont know I dont have answers and I dont know what happened to me or why .

If anyone has experienced anything similar please share with me and id love to hear anyones opinions or theorys .

If this doesnt belong here let me know thanks for taking the time to read this and apolagies for bad grammar and spelling .






Edit : I really wasnt expecting this to get such a huge response but thank you everybody for the support and kind words .

Its really hard to answer everybody individually so il answer as much as I can here from the most asked questions etc.

I will deffo be seing my doctor tomorow
I have no history of seizures or any other health issues.
Im in my twenties and fairly fit and of sound mind. 
I would rather be safe than sorry and of course its possible that there is a simple answer and please god there is.

It happened in ireland and I was in the midlands id rather not be to specific.

The headaches and blurry vision have only been an issue sinse after the incident.
Ive never had migraines before etc.

They had no definitive shape the things or beings but they were large and moving with purpose and inteligence.

I could smell something which I thought was my brain frying from how loud the sound was and I know that sounds insane but I had to cover my ears and crouch down with my head between my knees in almost a fetal position out of fear from the sound and panic just before I blacked out when I closed my eyes and could see they were less than five feet from me I could smell a sulphur metalic type smell 
Then the flash occurred that was blinding  and I woke up four hours later

I was considerably dry even though it was drizeling when this occurred and when I woke I realised four hours had passed it was raining heavy but I was pretty much dry 
I cant explain it but there has to be a sound reason for all of it 

I wont lie I am shook up and a little freaked out but im a rational young man and I wont jump to any one conclusion without sound evidence and proof.
 
I was in an area impossible for me to get lost in, a child maybe but not an adult and at one moment I felt like I was completely lost in a place I did not recoqnise what so ever and that makes no sense to me at all coz when I awoke I knew exactly where I was.

Thank you everyone again for all the support and il update with my doctors findings thanks friends

t3_en8i3k,all_ads,My apartment makes be feel deeply uncomfortable,Thetruthishere,"Hey, so I’m quite new to all this to be honest. I’ve never posted before, be it here or on reddit generally but after what happened last night, I feel like I should. I hope my story belongs here and I might get some help because I feel really uncomfortable and want to find a solution. 

So, for y’all to get the situation and all, I’m a 18 years old girl and I moved to Paris back in September to attend to university. And since I’m in Paris, I’ve felt bad about buildings and street quite often. Like just getting this odd feelings that something is off. It happened where I was staying at first but nothing happened. 

Then I moved into the apartment I’m currently renting. It’s a small room (11 square meters) on the 5th floor of an old Parisian building in the 9th arrondissement. I have everything in it (my bed, a small kitchen, a shower, a table and two shelves) and there is a balcony with a street view. The street my apartment is located in is a side street. Not really scary but I kind of always rush to get in the building when I get home alone at night. But the main streets are welcoming and I never feel bad while walking there even if it’s really late. So as you can see, there isn’t nothing really strange. 

But last night, something happened and it’s already the second time so yeah, I’m afraid enough to want to make it stop already. 

Yesterday I came back home quite early from a friends birthday. It was 8pm and I just laid in bed for two hours eating snacks since I was really tired (I have mononucleosis and I’m only starting to feel better so a full day out is still draining all my energy) but around 11pm I was getting really hungry. I cooked myself mac&amp;cheese and then went back to bed with my plate. Everything was alright at the time. But once I was done, had cleaned everything and went back in bed, it was nearly midnight I believe and I started feeling strange. I was watching videos or reading when I got the feeling that there was something in my apartment. The light was still on so I had no doubt that – once I had looked around – there was nothing. My place is so small, it’s not as if it was possible to hide actually. And I’m facing the door anyway so I would have seen if someone had entered – and heard since my door is super hard and noisy to open. But there was nothing. 

I turned my light off and the feeling became stronger. I felt unsafe in my bed as if there was something at the end of my bed, my the door. I looked up again with my phone light. Nothing. Once again I saw absolutely nothing out of ordinary. 

But it was impossible to go to sleep. Absolutely impossible. I tried turning on music, turned the light back on but I can’t sleep with the light so I had to turn it back off. I sent a message to a friend of mine and she asked if I wanted her to call me. I said no since I wanted to sleep and didn’t wanted to bother her anyway. 

But I couldn’t close my eyes. So I got out of my apartment to turn on the light of the staircase which I can see from inside my apartment and opened the curtains so that the light of the street which never turns off would go in. I got in my duvet cover, wrapped myself in it and just concentrate. I was scared, and the shadows seemed to me moving or at least I had the feeling that I was catching glimpses of moving shapes in the dark which is something I am familiar with since it happened to me a lot when I was a child – almost ever night in fact and it terrorized me so much that I’m still afraid now. I managed to get some sleep and once the sun had arisen this morning, I just closed the curtains and slept like a baby. 

But the problem is that it’s not the first time that I feel bad in my apartment. Once, I got waken up around 5 or 6 am feeling dreadfully terrorized, deeply convinced that there was an imminent danger, something that wanted to harm me in the back of my room, at the end of my bed, near one of the shelf and once again close from the door. I had to roll myself into fœtal position under my cover to try to catch up my breath, not praying to be safe but almost until this feeling got away and I could go back to sleep. 

I honestly don’t know what is happening here and even tho I’ve been joking a lot saying that someone must have been killed in and got their dead body hidden in this building, I can’t get the thought out of my mind that there really is something dangerous here. I feel really uncomfortable now even tho it’s daytime now. 

If someone has a idea of what it may be and what I can do to get rid of whatever is scaring me, please tell me. It can’t continue like this."
t3_emyat6,all_ads,The Day I May Have Seen Death,Thetruthishere,"Background: Death has many connotations to different people. For me it’s just an inevitable thing that occurs to everyone. I’ve nearly died a dozen times myself, whether it be from drowning or getting shot at, I always tend to find myself in situations which warrant a fear of death. That being said I do fear death, but I respect it. I know that someday I will die, how is the biggest mystery of all. One of the times I was the closest to it is the experience I’ll share today, it’s the day I’m almost certain I saw death.

It was summer and I had just turned 13, in the summer my mom would take my sister and I to a part of the park nearby that had a fairly good sized river in it. This place is fairly well known and hosts a lot of picnics and wedding shoots. The place that most of this happens at is a place with a lot of rapids and little waterfalls. It truly is beautiful and one of my favorite places to swim. Back then however it was an off limits swimming area per my mom. 

You see, this part of the river mainly the 8ft waterfall, had a track record for deaths. At the base of the waterfall there is a whirlpool that’s pulls you down about 8-10ft depending on the water level. The fact that it was off limits made it irresistible to me. I would ask time and time again if I could swim there. And usually it was a resounding no. But in this day we ran into my mammaw and aunts here and my mom was occupied. So when I asked her she said “yeah, sure” as a way to brush me off. 

I went to the waterfalls which were just a short walk from our current area, and jumped in. Instantly I loved it, it was as deep if not more than our current spot and hosted a couple of natural water slides. I was having a lot of fun but I noticed the waterfall. For some reason, my teenage mind thought the best course of action was to climb it up and jump back in. So I began the ascent. 

As I climbed I started thinking it was a bad idea and decided to climb back down but I grabbed a very loose rock and i came tumbling down with the rock in tow. I fell into the whirlpool and it took me down to the bottom of the then 6ft drop. The rock landed on my foot and crushed it ( it was about the size of a cat). I was of course freaking out and splashing about.   By straining my legs I was able to get my mouth to the surface and scream for help but there was no one around and the sounds of the waterfall drowned me out. 

I started to pray and beg to be saved. After a minute of that I looked up on the top of the waterfall and saw someone standing there. I can still see them as clear as it was yesterday, they wore all black clothes and had blonde hair. I screamed for help and they smirked. This put two things into my mind: fear and determination. I went underwater and pulled the rock up enough for me to painfully pull my foot out of it and swam against the current to the shore. And the person was nowhere to be seen. It had only been seconds ago so there was no way they got out of my line of vision. I limped back to my mom who of course yelled at me for going there. 

I ended up just having a scraped up foot and sprained ankle. I told my pastor about it and he said it was a demon (but so is everything here) I told some of my more religiously free peers and they told me it could’ve been death. I don’t really know. Since then I’ve nearly gotten myself killed a couple of more times, even beeen in the hospital for it, but never seen him again. My views on death and life itself have changed. I’m more understanding of it and have to deal with it a lot. 

TL; DR: I climbed a waterfall and pinned myself underwater, I nearly died and think I saw death."
t3_en58jc,all_ads,The Owl,Thetruthishere,"When I was a sophomore in high school, I was like a magnet to paranormal experiences. One of the most unique and memorable ones is when I met an owl named ""Spirit."" Spirit is a 7 foot tall white owl with red eyes and black feet. I first saw it outside of my window and shook it off, thinking I was tired and hallucinating. A few months later my boyfriend and I were talking about strange experiences and he mentioned an owl figure that would visit him as a child named Spirit. He explained exactly what I saw, it was stunning. One night I sat outside and listened to music and zoned out, staring at the pavement when I saw something move really fast through the trees. I saw a shadow-like man with a hat. Both he and this owl came to me in a dream a couple days later. It wasn't a normal dream, they just existed in this dream. I ended up moving shortly after the experience and only spotted Spirit one more time right as I was leaving to go to the new home. My mom pointed him out and said ""That looks strange, like a tall white crane.""
Any ideas on what this thing could be or similar experiences? I live just west of the Appalachia, if there's any folklore surrounding a creature like this I'd love to know. From my own research I have found a demon named Stolas who shares some similarities with Spirit and that's why I marked it as demon. But I really don't know much about the shadow man."
t3_en3pp3,all_ads,Help identifying an entity?,Thetruthishere,"I asked this same question to the occultists but i was hoping that people here also have insight into what i recently encountered.  

So i have had a series of what could best be described as supernatural encounters over the past few months. It began when i went home to New England for Thanksgiving and I've experienced several more events recently that lead me to believe i encountered something significant.

All of these events took place on a forest reservation that i spent a lot of time in as a kid. It is a young rocky forest that was previously a quarry and logging area for New England colonists. There are a lot of ""ruins"" in the forest from settlers, mostly just foundations and stone fences remain. I spent a lot of time here throughout high-school. It was where i walked my dog, meditated and ran to whenever life stressed me out (also the location of my first suicide attempt). This place has always had a calming effect on me and it has a special place in my heart.

There were rumors around this forest. Stories of cults,chanting and strange noises. I assumed just high-school nonsense until recently.

The first encounter I had was at night, around 10pm day after thanksgiving. It was dark but i was used to it and i had my dog with me. I was at my favorite part for meditation ; the ruins of a fire tower on the rocky hill where the wetlands turn into proper forest. I saw lights, not from flashlights but from fire. Glowing orbs moving though the trail down the hill. At least 10 hooded individuals with torches were marching silently away from me. I've never ran so quickly in my life. i was back on the trail though the wetlands, slipping in mud trying to get away as quickly as possible. My dog was no help at all, he kept refusing to move on and whimpered whenever i pulled him.

This was where shit got real, it was the second time in my life where i felt like i was going to die. Screaming, inhuman, high pitched screeching from the bushes all around me. The bushes were rustling, my dog cowered under my legs and the wind picked up. It got louder and louder until i couldn't hear. I picked up my dog ( a mud covered 50 pound coonhound, wasn't fun) and just ran until i was out of the forest and back to my house. Couldn't sleep that night or for the rest of my time home in November.

The next encounter happened just before Christmas. I decided to go back to the forest, with my dog of course. Although this time i went early in the morning so i could get a long walk in. Strangely enough i wasn't nervous, i felt welcomed into the forest. I love deer tracking in the winter (dog loves it too, although hes shit at it) , I like to get as close as i can and just watch. I was off-trail for sometime before finding a herd. I followed a male who had broken off from the herd for around 20 minutes. I lost him behind a rock and rushed a bit forward to catch him but i tripped up and he sprinted away.

I went behind the rock, there were some thick bushes behind it and I was surprised to see a pair of huge antlers inside the bush. What i thought was a deer moved towards me but when i saw its face i froze. Not a deer really but not anything recognizable, not anything i could really comprehend. The closest i can get to describing it is a human but uncanny and wrong if that makes any sense. Its two yellow eyes are still burned into my mind. And then it was over, gone, disappeared as soon as i blinked. My dog was calm though out this, almost bored by it. And i can't really say that i was scared by it..i felt comforted if a little uneasy and confused. I spent the rest of the day trying to get out of the woods, i was hopelessly lost and ended up in a part of the forest i had never been to. Ended up walking out in a neighboring town and then ubering back home.

So that is my story so far. I plan to return home in the summer and look for more clues as to what i encountered. Reading back what i wrote here...it sounds like a shitty horror movie but i swear on my family that this was my true experience.

tl:dr

I am looking for an entity with the following characteristics

1. Inhabits forests in New England. Could be Native American in origin? Maybe some connection to witchcraft ?
2. Has an association with deer, nature and winter
3. Is actively worshiped
4. I don't believe the spirit is malicious, although i do not believe it is harmless.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
t3_emxjwa,all_ads,[MUL] Terrorizing the Bag Boys,Thetruthishere,"I've posted quite a few times about my experiences, but I somehow glossed over my time in high school when I worked as a bag boy at the local supermarket.  I grew up in a farm town, and the only place to get groceries besides the grossly overpriced Shopko on the edge of town was the family-owned supermarket, Robertson's.  The Robertson family was very active in the community, but also had a reputation from miserly to straight-up evil, depending on who you asked.

If you asked me and the rest of the bag boys, Robertson's had a dark aura around it.  Many features contributed, like the vaulted ceilings in the back rooms, the creaking floors in the upstairs offices, and the door hidden behind a pile of old shelves that seemed to lead under the loading dock.

The worst was the patriarch of the Robertsons, Blaine.  He was too old to handle the business decisions, but he was too stubborn to let his toupee-toting son take it out of his hands, so he spent his days shuffling around the floor, antagonizing the bag boys at every turn.  He'd chastise us for clocking in more than one minute early.  He'd chastise us for standing at the clock with a minute left in our shift.  He'd chastise us for our laziness the second we weren't actively moving items.

I always joked that Blaine was a vampire.  He just refuses to die.  Why else is there never a call over the intercom for kids who lost their parents?  One night, my suspicions were reinforced.  Blaine had showed up about 9 to take care of some office work upstairs.  With all of our closing duties done, my partner for the night and I lollygagged in the stock room, right at the foot of the office stairs.

When 10 rolled around and it was time to close, I figured I'd let Blaine know we were locking up.  I started up the stairs and suddenly noticed it was dark.  I got to the top and looked around.  Not a single light in the offices was on.  We had stood at the bottom of the stairs the whole time and Blaine hadn't passed us.

Even when Blaine isn't looming like Nosferatu, strange things happen upstairs.  The  exposed water pipes leading upstairs twang like someone hit them with a hammer.  Footsteps on the creaky floor echo through the whole back room.  All of this happens when the offices are pitch black, as we stand next to the stairs.

One night, my partner and I got freaked out by the noises from the offices and decided to spend the remainder of the shift lapping the store.  But as we walked perpendicular to the aisles, a can of green beans halfway down the vegetable aisle suddenly fell off the shelf.  We put it back in place and started walking again.

Two aisles down, another can fell off.  This time, as I put it back in place, a can 15 feet down the aisle flew off the shelf.  We left that one sitting and huddled around the cash registers for the rest of the shift.

To top it off, though, a bag boy requested to be taken off night shifts after an experience he had in the break room.  The break room has two small bathrooms, male and female.  He was taking his dinner break when he heard a baby crying from the women's bathroom.  He had been in there 5 minutes already and hadn't seen anyone come in, much less with a baby.

He endured the crying for 5 more minutes before he got concerned and knocked on the door.  Repeated knocks and questions got nothing back except for the nonstop bawling.  He was finally convinced something had happened to the mother and cracked the door open.  The room was dark and empty."
t3_en3l2k,all_ads,Hell Hounds,Thetruthishere,"I've been skimming through some of the stories on here and reading them inspired me to share one of my own.

I had just turned 19, been moved out for about 9 months or so. I have to admit I loved living by myself. I stayed up late everynight playing video games and watching Netflix, I had a great bachelor pad, plus I always tried to have friends over on my days off. The only thing that sucks is the location. It's in bat country and I live right beside a graveyard.

I used to be really against any type of drug, but as I grew older I learned about how amazing weed was, and one of my buddies always brought over a few blunts so we'd match and just hang out. One night he decided to bring over some LSD.

I had done acid before, but only one time. I'm not against it, I just hate how long you're usually tripping, but I took the hit anways, about 8 pm, and started my trip some time later. We played Breath of the Wild (literally the best experience while tripping) for like, at least 4 hours, then my friend said he wanted to go for a walk.

I live on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere, and with both of us tripping our balls off neither of us thought to grab a flashlight. Everything seemed fine at first, until we got to the graveyard. It was on top of another little mountain with a hill that had the driveway going up it and a lightpost shining down for people to see to drive up. I just didn't feel right, as soon as we got to the driveway that lead up I could just tell something was off.

Then I blinked. When I opened my eyes, for a split second, I saw a pitch black dog standing a few feet away from me in the driveway with the light shining on it. It honestly looked like a rottweiler, really muscular, and it's eyes were a piercing red. As soon as I blinked again it was gone.

Immediately after that I demanded to go back inside. The freaky part is we didn't talk about it that night, I just chocked it up to me tripping, but the next morning when we sobered up, my friend wole me up and while we were eating, he asked me if I saw that dog at the graveyard last night."
t3_empp32,all_ads,Why I am afraid of the dark...,Thetruthishere,"At first I am sorry for mistakes in the text. English is not my first language and I am just bad with grammar and stuff. I hope it’s still okay to read. And also sorr, if there are typos... I wrote this while being in a train on my mobile phone...

So as a child I had a, for me, very traumatic experience.
You can believe it or not but that story is the reason why I am still scared to be outside in the dark.

When I where younger, I can’t say how old I exactly was, abou 4 I think... My big brother and I loved to camp outside our home. Infront of the house there was a small forest. If you went outside you stood directly in front of this really small forest. There was never anything spooky about it... We always played in it ... Even when it was just a steep slope... With trees.
It was our favourite place to be. Just playing, doing stupid things... Being a child. It always was my favourite place and a happy place.
One day we decided to camp outside again. We build the tent and at night we went in it, cuddles in our warm and safe sleeping back. Everything like always.
And me?
Not afraid at all. Also brave enough to go the like 15 meters to the entrance alone to go to the toilet in the middle of the night.
I went in... Few minutes later went back out... Not even looking at the forest at all. 
Do you know the feeling... Like someone or something is watching you?
I had that feeling, I had the feeling that I need to stop and take a look to the forest. So I stopped. 
I stopped to look at the forest. And there where two big red eyes starring right back at me. For a few second I was like frozen because of fear and after that I just ran back to the tent and back into the safety of my sleeping back.
Shivering in fear.
A the grown up told me was abou child imagination... Car lights... So I believed them ...
But I know it wasn’t a car because there was no way a car could fit there...
From that night I was afraid of the dark. Years later my brother told me he also saw those red eyes...

Did you experienced something like that?
I would love to know..."
t3_emw8f6,all_ads,Helicopter Fly Overs,Thetruthishere,"Has anyone else noticed the sudden increase in military helicopters doing fly overs at extremely low altitudes?  

It started a couple of days ago.  I went out for a hike, and this pair of military helicopters flew over me.  They appeared to be 100 yards off the ground, and they came out of the west and flew east.  If not for my startled dog, I would have waved at the pilots.  About 30 minutes into the same hike, another pair flying at the same altitude came from the southwest and flew to the northeast.  

Just now, I heard a loud helicopter buzz over my house again.  It bothers my poor dogs.

Edit:
I'm in Northern Arizona, White Mountains area.  We have 2 power plants an hour from me.  One pair of helicopters were Apaches.  The other pair appeared to be Blackhawks.  These helicopters used a different path and altitude than the commercial ones (emergency medical transport, single engine planes, commercial airliners).  I heard them again last night around midnight.  In retrospect, they started the day after they bombed that Iranian general."
t3_emv3ko,all_ads,Childhood Nightmare,Thetruthishere,"Have you guys ever had a dejavu where first it happened in a dream, you are in a place you surely have never visited before then some time in the future, you see the exact place in the dream long ago even when the place has not yet existed prior to the time you dreamt of that particular visit?

I had a terrible nightmare once when I was a young boy. As best I could remember now. I was around 5-6 years old when I had that nightmare. I was in preparatory level that time. And believe it or not. It's not like I forgot about it right now. I just couldnt recall it that easily,
And I never knew that I will always remember a moment from that nightmare. That was the only thing I remember from it though and it all came back to present memory because of last night.

And I am certain I had that nightmare because when I was young, me and my mother always sleep beside each other in our first house. And that nightmare was the worse in all of my childhood. my mother as she recalls it with me few years later teasing would always say she once would simultaneously vibrate my chest with her palm and strongly says ""Siging Siging Siging!"" Which till to this day I dont know what it means but the elderly and the suspicious in my country always use it to calm someone down from extreme shock. And I know my mother only calmed me down with that once  because they believe its effect drastically go down when used more than once. 

All the details from that nightmare that had me crying while sleeping were vague and I couldnt even remember that I had it a long time ago in my memory progressing to something awfully familiar to something scary reminiscent.

Wierd but I remember it like remembering the multiplication table. like it was just there. Already there, but you cant just randomly burst it out the same way you remember and say your name. You just needed the trigger to completely recall. 

From what my memory recalls, the room was small. It had a simple and round wooden coffee table on the left, almost in the center near the wall. It was dark but it had a shiny brown light radiating from a candle from the coffee table which fills the area of the coffee table and lit the dirty white wall behind it. The wall I was facing to. And from its right was a a round arc shaped entrance to another part of the building or house. There wasnt a door. Just a round arc shaped entrance which even by the darkness got its shaped highlighted by the candle from the coffee table to see

My perspective from that nightmare was me facing ahead all those details and I couldnt move nor do anything else. It was like sleep paralysis but I was sitting down. The arc entrance at the right side the coffee table  gave dim vision to that left side of the round arc shaped entrance

I know this is a common case but from that dark round arc entrance suddenly came out a white mahogany mud colored woman who was fast enough to jump out but everything was so slow when it happened. I couldnt see that face because of its hair covering it was horribly scary as it moved disturbingly towards me and pounced on me. I couldnt remember what happened after that in that nightmare.

Many years later, right now in the present. Just last night. I had the same nightmare again. Same coffee table by the left. Same candle lights on top centre of the coffee table. Same dimmed round arc entrance. Same darkness. So much the same that It made me scared to remember that it lacked one last detail and It had me nervous expecting the white mahogany  mud colored woman figure to disturbingly pounce again but it was not there. Just plain darkness and the kindling light of the candle.

As I woke up from the next morning deciding to make a reddit account to find answers on how could that happen again. 

Same day this afternoon my mother texted me that we will be spending the friday evening in our new house which had just been made 2 years ago and I rarely sleep there because Im far away for College and will always prefer to choose to come home in our first house 

I slowly forgot about the nightmare from last night as then I prepped to leaving for our 2nd house. It was already evening as I arrived in our second house and went inside.

As I sat on the floor leaning on the sofa's base (I find indian sitting most comfortable) while again scrolling down the subreddits in my phone, I faced as I glanced the wall of our small living-esque dining room. I felt uneasy as Im in the same Angle of perspective exactly from my nightmare. I see the same size of the room from that perspective, the round arc entrance to the kitchen at the right side. Everything was getting familiar and It struck me cold and with a headache to have this creepiest realization.  

[My new house living room](https://imgur.com/gallery/MnU46hS)

Except for the round coffee table, and the candle litted darkness. Everything else was the same from my nightmare except for last detail in that horrid memory of a dream. 

And I couldnt rest easy knowing who knows when  the white muddy figure comes out the dark round arc entrance anytime Im in the room myself.

t3_emqwdo,all_ads,[DIS] Does carving a statue of an entity invite it in?,Thetruthishere,"Recently I decided to take up carving as a hobby, and since I have a long fondness for Slavic folklore I decided to carve a little domovoi.

Thanks for your support :)"
t3_emcigd,all_ads,Encounter with extraterrestrial beings??,Thetruthishere,"So this story isn’t recent but I just found this sub and I feel like it would go good here. Hopefully lol also it is a pretty long story and actually makes me cry thinking about and will probably cry writing it. 

Anyway I’m 19 now but this experience took place when I was 12. 

The night this encounter happened everything was pretty normal. I was going back to school the next morning after summer break so I had to be in bed earlier than I would have liked. 

I remember falling asleep to the movie meet the Robinson’s (amazing movie btw) playing at probably around 10:30 pm. And then I woke up and I knew it had to be late, but the first thing I registered was the tv and it was completely scrambled the image I mean, almost like a dvd that doesn’t want to play so it skips, but it was frozen so the image was warped and boxy. Except the meet the robinsons movie dvd wasn’t damaged. 

At this point I guessed it was around 2 or 3 am. The second thing I registered were the voices coming from the kitchen. I got out of bed to see what was going on because the voices were talking pretty loud and they sounded kind of panicked. When I got to the kitchen I realized that it was my mom and older sister, who was 18 at the time, and they were arguing.

The first thing I actually picked up and comprehended in the convo was my mom say “those are definitely aliens. What the fuck else could they be?” She was almost hysterical. 

Neither of them saw me enter the kitchen but I asked what was going on and my mom looked at me and I knew that she was scared and shaken. She literally had tears in her eyes. She told me in an almost sad voice that there were aliens outside. 

At this point we were all standing in the kitchen in front of our sliding glass door that looked out to our yard and the field across the road. I was confused so she pulled back the curtain to the kitchen door and i didn’t see anything initially because I didn’t look hard enough. But i saw my hugeee dog, German Shepard and Great Dane mix, sitting in the middle of the yard, in the direction of the neighbors, which was to my houses right side. 

I asked my mom why he wasn’t on the porch like normal and why he was sitting so still. To that she slid open the door very slowly, to not make much noise I assume. And usually when the door to the house opens my dog will look towards the sound of it if he is around the yard, which he was, but he didn’t even look at us, his gaze remained undeterred. 

I didn’t realize what was going on but I was scared because my mom was clearly scared as was my older sister. My mom signaled my sister and I to be quiet. And we were. You could, on a normal night, hear the animals in the woods or the trees in the wind and crickets chirping because it was summer, but that night we couldn’t hear anything. It was completely silent outside, not even a breeze. This gave me chills that made me shake. Something was terribly off. 

My mom shut the door. And my sister and I followed her to her bedroom, where my dad was asleep and the window was open. There she explained to me what was going on. 

She told me that my sis was in my room looking for something and peaked out the window. My room is in the back of the house and my window looks out to the trees behind the house. She saw what she thought was a pack of coyotes but there were about 30 of them and the closer she looked she started to see distinguishable features and that’s when she dipped out of my room and went and told my mom. 

My mom told me that walked outside, before my sister came to her about what she saw, and saw a tall dark and slender figure walking down the neighbors driveway towards our house. She thought it was the neighbor coming over for some reason. But then she got scared suddenly and felt like it would be best to pretend to be asleep so she wouldn’t have to talk to the “neighbor”. 

And those events lead us to go to the kitchen window that overlooked the two neighboring houses right next to each other. It was dark. But we were looking very hard. And we could start to make out shadowy figures. 

Most of them were small and moved super fast. So fast that if you weren’t paying attention you wouldn’t have noticed. And if you paid even more attention, you could see the slower taller ones. They moved slow and their silhouettes were darker than their background but they were almost fluid looking. It just did not look real at all. 

And this sucks but we didn’t even think about grabbing a camera and trying to catch pictures. Which I regret just thinking back. 

Another thing I noticed and is worth mentioning I think, was that behind the neighbors house they had woods too. Well, within the trees and very low to the ground, there were three evenly spaced lights. One was green, the other red, and another blue I think. The lights were pretty dim but they were never there before. 

We watched out the window for about ten minutes freaking out. My mom was almost weezing at this point, she was so shocked. 

After that she took us into her room and opened the window more, which I didn’t like, it made me nervous. 

She told us to be quiet. And since we couldn’t hear anything at all coming from outside we sat in silence. Until we heard what sounded like a car passing on the road. And engine sound but we could see the road from my moms window and there were no cars, no headlights, nothing. But the engine buzz was loud and turned into sounding like a plane was passing over the house, that’s how loud it got. This lasted about a minute or so then it went completely silent again. And after a few minutes would repeat the engine sound. 

After all of these happened, my mom shut the window and closed the curtains. And we sat in her room, all of us basically shaking.

Anyway another thing to point out was, I did eventually work up the courage to go back to my room. But that was a few hours later and was starting to get light out. The tv was still scrambled so I tried to eject the disc and it wasn’t working. So I ended up having to unplug the DVD player to get the scramble off the tv. 

That’s about all that happened that night. But it freaked me out so bad that the only time I can speak of it out loud without crying is when I’m drunk. I don’t mention it to anyone except the people I trust with my life. And even then they sometimes don’t get to hear the full story.  

But I want to know your guys thoughts on this. Is there any rational explanation for things I saw?"
t3_emo2lq,all_ads,Dreams that feel like Deja Vú,Thetruthishere,"So this starts a couple years prior, maybe 2 or 3. I’ve started having dreams that i could vividly remember. I had even started writing them down in my notes. I always brushed it off as just another vivid dream until it started happening in real life. I could recall that I had lived the dream before but this time it was actually happening. I had also talked to some close people and they had suggested they were premonitions? I’m afraid that one day I’ll have prior knowledge to something bad but will not be able to stop it.

Currently, these premonitions are harmless. I’ll just have a very eerie feeling. Something to note is that I get sleep paralysis very often. Like multiple times a week. Does anyone have any similar feelings or relatable experiences?"
t3_emxso8,all_ads,Heard Someone On The Phone,Thetruthishere,"Hey, I’m just looking for some feedback - ideas on what it was and how to stop it. This is kinda long, but I appreciate you reading it anyway !

I’ve always seen things that other people don’t, always been afraid of the dark, I’ve always known there’s something there. There are two people in my life that tend to get involved and I try to protect them from the things they can’t see. 

Last night, one of them fell asleep on the phone with me. I don’t sleep really at night but I like to know someone’s there so I often stay on the phone with him. We’ve agreed that he needs to keep a small lamp on or something while he sleeps. He always agrees and always complies with whatever I tell him about protecting himself. 

He was sound asleep, everything was fine. And then he yelled, like a very loud grunt or something, and I waited - sometimes he grunts in his sleep but this was very loud, sounded like he was in pain. So I said his name, thought I might wake him up if he was having a nightmare. And then there was a voice, very low and garbled; there was a static like sound around it and it sounded a bit away from him. And then it kept getting closer and then I could hear it’s breathing right beside the phone. Right near his head. So I started to yell his name and he was not waking up. And the breathing was getting heavier and my friend started to make some grunts. I hung up and called back right away, hoping the sound of the phone ringing would wake him up and make the thing go away. He answered, I was yelling, he woke up right away. He was fine, he promised he had a lamp on, and he fell back asleep. I stayed up most of the night and didn’t hear anything else again. 

Today, I asked him how he felt - if he remembered hearing anything, if he’d had any nightmares, if there was anything physically wrong with him. He said he was fine, he slept well. 

I don’t live near him, so I need something else other than light that can protect him if I’m not there. Please let me know if you have any suggestions."
t3_emocpz,all_ads,"This area had a few deaths and I saw a shadow person and maybe a ghost kid (same area, different times)",Thetruthishere,"So to give an idea right up the street from me is a forest area, but right before is a big fenced in electric powerplant type thing with generators and those powerline towers.  So in the 50's a young paperboy tried to get a kite off the wire and climbed the thing and got electrocuted and died, also there was a suicide up there.

So me and my cousin were walking my fat little beagle dog up there and I would usually do a lap around the fenced in area. The front is where the street led up to and the back is were the forest is and no houses. As we pasted the far end and were almost to the front there is a cement divider to stop dirt bikes. My fat little dog was to big to squeeze through so my cousin went first and as I am trying to pick my dog up he says look at that kid. There is a little boy just staring at us from the far end with what I can only describe as a evil or emotionless expression. We both got the chills and hair up on our necks and my dog was whimpering, my cousin almost bolted down the street but he did not want to leave my dog. The boy had raggity clothes and they did not seem like clothes from the early 2000's and I thought it was weird a little boy would be out there by himself. We knew something was weird and left.  
Fast forward a couple years I am sitting on my porch between 2-3am smoking a cigarette with my mom and we see a little boy walking up the hill with his head down to the forest area.  Mind you there are no street lights so we both got freaked out and thought why would a little kid walk up there alone and that late.  We both thought it was the little kid that died.  It felt like something was trying to get us to go up there, but as an older teenager I wouldn't dare go up there alone.

It was a sunny day in the summer and we would ride dirt bikes in the forest and at the beginning were the fenced in area was there was a clearing. I would do laps  in the clearing and my sibling was with me, they decided to go home but I wanted to ride some more as I got to the far end I saw at the opening a dark figure with the top hat shadow person. I instantly got a sense of fear, but not threatened (I was shocked at what I saw) it just stood there and the only way out was to ride past it. I was little but I swear it was 7-9 feet tall amd just stood there. There was no face but I know it was watching me. 

Sorry for the 2 part but usually I read people seeing the shadow person in sleep paraylsis, but I seen it in broad daylight.

I have not been up there since and that was the only time I felt like I saw something paranormal"
t3_emjwl5,all_ads,Street lamps turning off when near?,Thetruthishere,"Okay, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but after reading a few threads I believe my experiences belong under this subreddit..... to make a long story short does anyone know the meaning of street lights turning off when you walk or drive by them? I started noticing it a few years ago and could be over thinking since I’ve noticed it, but it seems to happen so often to me, when I’m walking at night or even driving by in my car. A couple of instances stick out, the first was one night walking my dog and I had first started noticing lights going out when I walk by, as I was approaching the light I thought to myself “if this is a sign, show me” and immediately as I became parallel with the light it shut off. Another is also a time I was walking my dog and as I walked by the light it shut off and then came back on after I walked maybe 50 yards passed. I looked back to see it on and felt creeped out,  I wanted to chalk it up to coincidence so I turned back around and walked towards it again, as I got near it shut off again!! Then to make things worse it came back on again after I had walked away. I was spooked to say the least.
I get scared I have a dark entity following me or within me? (I know I sound looney, but I truly am weirded out by this) Or maybe street lights do this often to others and I’m just over thinking? I’m not sure what to make of this!! Any thoughts or similar experiences?"

t3_embq0n,all_ads,Chased out of the woods,Thetruthishere,"About a year ago me and a friend went hiking on a trail in Roan Mountain State Park up to the Peg Leg mine. When we got there we noticed that it looked like it would begin to rain, but we continued anyway. We also noticed that it was oddly quiet and that we were the only ones around. We went to the visitor center to see if anyone was there and they were closed for the day. We debated on whether or not we should go, and eventually decided to go on the trail anyway. Once we started on the trail it did in fact begin to rain, and then an eerie fog began to roll in. Well from the moment the fog came in I felt uneasy and never really mentioned anything to my friend. When we got up to the flat part of the trail, this part not being to far from the mine. I immediately got the feeling of being watched and from this point on I was on high alert. When we got to the mine, we walked around the top of it, then went down to the mouth and took some pictures... this is when I heard sounds coming from the ridge above us. I told my friend that I think we needed to leave and he obliged. On the way out he was in front and I was in the back, and we started to hear growing coming from behind us and the sound of something walking through the brush behind us. I told my friend to stay calm and keep his eyes on the trial ahead of us, and that when we could see the building of the visitor center to run. At this point he was freaking out and I was trying my best to keep him calm. When we rounded the trail where you could see the building we bolted and the thing behind us came after us. We ran out of the tree line, but the creature behind us would not leave the tree line so we couldn’t see what it was. We didn’t stick around long though, we ran to our vehicles and tore out of the parking lot. We still talk about it to this day and we’re still not sure what chased us. My parents though I was crazy and others told us we imagined the whole thing. The ones did believe us told us that it could’ve been a wendigo, or some other type of Native American folk lore. I’m just thankful we made it out alive. Would love to hear feedback!"
t3_eme6t3,all_ads,Strange sounds at a local park at night,Thetruthishere,"I used to spend a lot of time with friends during the summer exploring creepy places at night or just hanging out in our local park enjoying the starry nights. 

One evening, there’s 4 of us hanging out in the local park. It’s probably 10 or 11pm. The area nearby has been notoriously known for seriously bad rituals and kidnappings at the abandoned plantation house on the mountain. 

That being said, we’re walking the parking lot roads just shooting the shiz when the light posts started flickering. Not a big deal, the park is old and maintenance is probably not up to date. Then we all hear what sounds like metal grating coming from the area in front of us. It sounded like someone dragging a knife on the light poles. We were the only ones there and there were no trees or hanging materials on any poles, nor a breeze. The lights in front of us start turning off one by one and the metal grating sound gets closer with each light. We’re all freaked out and decide to head back to the car. On the way back, we hear a woman screaming in the woods towards where the plantation house is in the distance, maybe a quarter mile or so away. As we’re trying to figure out if we should call the police to report a possible altercation in the forest, we hear faint footsteps and a little girl laugh right in front of us. 

That’s when we all booked it and didn’t come back for a few weeks. I came with a different friend who’s never been to the park and we both experienced the metal grating sound and footsteps. I didn’t return for a year or more and at my return, I could tell the general vibe of the area had changed. I don’t know how to explain it besides the air felt electrically charged and dense before, and now it feels neutral and light. 

Weird stuff, not sure how to explain it but I wanted to share that experience for the sake of it."
t3_emfmo2,all_ads,I’ve been looking for years for an answer.,Thetruthishere,"The first event happened a few years ago. 

My cousin and I used to live on a lake, so we would lay out like typical teenagers watching the stars until 2 am. One night, the night after Thanksgiving, we decided to go out and lay on the dock. I can remember having a very “off” feeling, and shook it off. We had been outside for about 45 minutes before I was staring at the sky and saw a ball of light, almost star like but fuzzy, disappear. I have no idea what it was, or even if it’s related to what happened next. I had an even worse feeling and pretended it wasn’t happening. About 15 minutes later, my cousin had a dog, so he would walk around behind us at night and do his dog thing. Well I heard a twig snap and assumed it was the dog. I had a gut feeling to look up, and in her backyard/clearing by the lake I saw 2 identical figures, standing, watching us. They were very slender and had triangle shaped heads. Same posture, body, everything. I’m not sure what we saw that night but i’m not sure it was human. We never heard a door of any sort, and when we walked by whatever they were to get back inside, they had already vanished with no noise. We didn’t speak about it for 10 minutes and sat in silence to comprehend what just happened. 

Fast forward 2 years. I live on a new lake, and part of the neighborhood is pure woods/swamp/ wildlife. At this, in the very back of my neighborhood, there’s a trail. At 10 pm, we decided to go down. Now, we could clearly hear the road in the distance, so we could distinguish cars passing from wind or any other noise. After walking down and her saying she had a bad feeling. I did too. Our flashlights barely worked, and as in barely worked i mean you could see the light on them illuminated but when you put them on anything they’d barely light it up when they were doing just fine moments before. Every noise stopped, and while trying to figure out What The Hell Is Happening I heard this inhuman whistling, almost a deep pitched humming, and what sounded almost like tree crushing.  

If anyone can give me even the smallest theory or a similar experience, please share."
t3_emej3y,all_ads,My Experience at a park in Missouri,Thetruthishere,"When I lived in missouri with my brother, we both worked at the same job. An AMF Bowling Alley as pinsetter mechanics. We didn't have a car so we unfortunately had to walk 5 miles to work and 5 miles home every day. 

About halfway between home and work was a park, where during the day was a normal looking park, but at night was something very sinister and dark.

One night, we had just closed up and I started my walk home. I get a phone call from my brother, nothing out of the ordinary, just bullshitting with each other. I started to approach ""The Park"" and my brother asked if there was anyone with me. I told him I was alone and about to cross in front of the park.

He told me not to go by the park and to wait there, he would come meet me. So I stayed and waited and I saw him coming from the other direction towards the park to meet me so I walked to meet him and we met directly in front of the park.

He told me that when he was on the phone with me he heard a low and raspy voice say ""Die, Die, Die"" on my end of the line. I was shocked and insisted no one was around me. At that point we noticed a fog roll in from the back of the park.

It became dead silent. No bug sounds, no wind, not a single sound. I became skittish so I took out a pocket knife with a silver blade (because I fully believe in the supernatural and know silver is a weapon). As I opened the knife, the bolt holding the blade to the grip broke and the blade hit the ground.

I stood there holding the empty grip of my knife. At this point the fog had encompassed the park and sidewalk. I reached down to pick up the blade and we both heard a very audible and loud cackle (like the witch from Wizard of Oz) coming from all around us and above us. I grabbed the blade and we both ran to get past the train tracks at the end of the park.

As soon as we crossed the old tracks, winded, we both look back and are shocked because there's no fog in sight. Its a clear night and the moon and stars were shining down. We both stared at each other puzzled, making sure we both saw and heard what we did.

We kept walking out way up a hill, just after the tracks and crossed in front of a church. When we hit the church, I felt this pain in my shoulders and almost felt like claws were gripping my shoulders and then ripping away from my skin. I fell to my knees, completely exhausted and my brother had to help walk me back the rest of the way home.

To this day, my brother and I talk about this and are sure there is some paranormal activity happening at this park.

TL;DR was walking home from work, brother met me, walked by a park, fog rolled in, heard a cackling laugh, we ran, looked back and saw no fog. Then walked by a church and felt claws gripping into my shoulders."
t3_eme03o,all_ads,Flying lights outside of my house,Thetruthishere,"Hey, so I’m pretty new to this sub but I figured this would go well here. I’ve been doing some digging to find a good few forums that cover this kind of stuff to follow. 
Anyhow, this isn’t too recent but it still is prevalent to me as I don’t like staying the night in my old house anymore. I apologise if this is a bit over explained, it’s just how I put words to thoughts. 

So this occurred on multiple nights throughout the past summer I believe. I was home for summer break from uni. I have sleep problems so it’s not unusual for me to wake up at odd hours of the night. One night I wake up in my living room around 3-3:30am, it’s completely dark in the den and dead quiet. I hop on my phone and start listening to YouTube, right? Well, shortly after I wake up I notice very bright white light shining in from the ground level windows. These lights illuminated the entire window frame, mind you these are large, person-sized panes. I get up and go look through the front door window and the lights are gone. Weird but probably just a car turning around in my drive way or someone messing with a drone. I go to the kitchen and this time the lights show up in the kitchen window, bright as hell. It moved away after a moment and then disappeared. 

This happened for multiple nights; I wake up around 3-4am, random lights follow me around my house, nothing else comes of it. I live in a rural/suburb part of North Carolina, we’ve never had robberies or any suspicious activity in my neighbourhood in the span of 20 years I’ve lived there. Not usually any traffic either after dark as it’s a secluded culdesac away from the main road. 

I’m not sure what to make of it honestly, I try to look at things from a skeptical and logical standpoint but I’m honestly stumped. One of the many odd things I’ve witnessed in my home area, this being the more tame of events."
t3_em15jl,all_ads,Lore about whistling?,Thetruthishere,"Had a couple things happen back in November that I’m hoping to shed some light on. 
First thing: I have always had insomnia. On this one night it was in full swing and I was kind of dozing in an out. Really restless sleep. Around 130am I thought I heard my upstairs bathroom tap turn on and off and then I heard whistling downstairs. I live in a very poorly soundproofed townhouse and can usually hear if anyone is moving around or what you have you. So I was alert after this and I listened but didn’t think  anyone had broken in or that there was an intruder because I would have heard them moving around. But then I heard water pouring onto the floor. This was my washer overflowing and flooding downstairs. My washer is old and not digital at all. So someone would have had to let it fill and then restart it so it tried to fill again to have it flood like that. 

Then second thing: a couple weeks later I was having a night walk. Listening to music. When I was almost home, my song ended and I heard whistling somewhere behind me. Which immediately stopped when I got to the townhouse complex driveway. It really creeped me out and I almost sprinted to my door. 
I didn’t connect those two things until someone said to me “it’s really weird that there was whistling again.”

It hasn’t happened since but I just thought I’d post to see if anyone has ideas."
t3_emezup,all_ads,Update pt2,Thetruthishere,"Hey everyone. So this is a second update on my the events that are happening in my apartment. So I have shadows walk across the door and my sister in law has seen a full body shadow standing in the living room a couple of weeks ago. 

The latest update and probably most freaky is that last while me and my girlfriend where getting ready for bed I was in the bedroom watching the tv and she was in the bathroom and I heard her say. “What are you doing?”  And I responded “I’m turning up the volume on the tv...” and she walked into the bedroom asking if I had been there the whole time. I said yes why and she told me she saw a skin toned figure peak around the door jam from the opposite side then our bedroom and she thought I was hiding trying to scare her. She said was just like a head looking around the corner and no other details to it other than the fact that it’s was actually skin colored and not just a black shadow. 

Any ideas on why it seems to be progressing? And does this seem harmless or is it a sign of things getting worse? Or is this possibly something completely unrelated to the shadows we’ve seen?"
t3_emcvzc,all_ads,Ouija board experience,Thetruthishere,"One night me and my coworkers decided to play with a ouija board out side of work. We talked to a girl named Quinn who said she was a demon. She seemed pretty cool till towards the end of taking to her we decided we needed to head home because it was like 2am but she wouldn't let us say goodbye until we promised that if we ever used the ouija board again that we would talk to her. About a week later the place where we worked caught on fire. So a few days after that we go to the lake and use the ouija board again and asked for Quinn. We asked if she started the fire and she told us that she did. Then it seemed like Quinn got scared or over powered because the board started acting up, spelled zozo and  started counting backwards. We quickly said goodbye and moved the planchette to goodbye. About 2 weeks later I was driving to my friends house. I should mention that the friend was a girl I was seeing at the time and she was cheating and using me. (I did not know this at the time)I guess Quinn knew because she seemed mad, protecting and jealous when me and my friends mentioned this girls name the first time we used the ouija board. So on the way to her house I hydroplaned and flipped my truck. I have to add the ouija board is in the truck. Some people driving down the road stopped to help get the door open and I climbed up and out. When the cops arrived they made sure I was ok and said they had to write me a ticket just because of the accident. I don't have the ticket anymore because this happened about 4 years ago but the address site of the accident was route 666 Virginia."
t3_emeis3,all_ads,Are there any animals/spirits/shadows responsible for good fortune that visit around twilight?,Thetruthishere,"Im copying and pasting something i posted to paranormal a month ago but no one responded and ive just been thinking about it :


I'm sure there's a explanation for this (thought for the life of me i cant figure out what) 

The day before it was right around sunset, (like before the sun disappears behind the mountains so just before twilight? It was strong, orange pink and bright)

So i was chilling in my bed, watching tv, with the sun on my face (annoying but its okay) and noticed weird movement from the corner of my eye.

To my right i have the window/door to the balcony (its a really small balcony, all u can really do is sit there or stand there and watch the sunset) Our apartment is on the 5th floor and this is a long door but also a window. 

But there was nothing/nobody there. No bird, it couldn't possibly be a cat or dog (5th floor) but im also confident it wasn't because i got up and looked - nothing to the left, nothing to the right - the entire balcony was empty but the shadow cast on the ground (which was a proper shadow because it was cast from the sun which was still visible and strong enough) was this weird creature moving about. It was moving about and shifting like some animal just chilling there and licking itself or watching the sunset?

 If i had to define it's shape it looked like maybe a dog or a cat or just a weird blob with ears and it moved around for half a minute then just disappeared. Like it sat there for a while, moving, then walked away and left. I went to the window to check again - maybe a giant bird but i would have seen that right away since i scanned the area.  

No idea what it was but maybe some spirit or creature came to watch the sunset from my balcony XD this is all I've been thinking of and i feel like maybe it was a spirit of fortune or luck because the next day (yesterday) i had 3 job offers /interviews (minor but still, something came my way after a long time) maybe that's just a coincidence though but if its not, I'm thankful.

What I've been wondering is.... What kind of spirits or animals are known to bring a little bit of luck and fortune?"

t3_elzzd4,all_ads,Fictional Characters Coming To Life,Thetruthishere,"I'll be honest here, I've been dealing with the supernatural for longer than I can remember and there are going to be some details about my life that even the most dedicated believers will have trouble taking in. 

I have little to no memory of some og my earliest encounters but my family still tells stories about how I seemingly knew who was calling before the phone would ring, how I knew my stepmother was pregnant before she had any signs, things of that nature. I looked into family history and managed to trace similar ""incidents"" taking place on both sides of my family. I could go on with my numerous encounters and the research operation I built around them that stumps even my contacts in mainstream science, but that is a novel in itself. For those who are interested, it has yet to be verified but there is some speculation I am a distant cousin of Ed and Lorraine Warren.

However I wanted to talk about one of the strangest cases I've taken on. Not too long ago I read that there have been quite a few authors/creatives who believe they met their creations in our world.

Here is an article about it: https://www.dailygrail.com/2015/04/meeting-their-makers-the-strange-phenomenon-of-fictional-characters-turning-up-in-real-life/

It's an interesting situation regardless of whether or not you believe it. I thought myself it was strange until I had something similar happen to me.

Just out of high school I started writing a series titled The Ones Who Walk All Worlds. It was a science fiction series based loosely on my cases, research, and theories. Obviously the protagonist  was modeled after myself. To make a long story short it is possible I wrote about my friend's murder, my family breaking apart, and meeting the woman I intend to marry.

While this all sounds like tulpas, I began to wonder if by some chance there was something more. What if by some chance parallel worlds are involved? Ghosts, demons, angels, UFOs, and so on are all allegedly possible because other dimensional planes interacting with our own. To be realistic the only proof which could validate there's anything to this idea would be to establish contact with another world.

If ghosts, demons, angels, etc... all came from ""higher dimensions"" then by logic of Superstring theory those said dimensions should be connected to multiple worlds just like our own. These other worlds would be more likely to sustain nearly identical circumstances which created the world as we know it now and anyone with the right ability, technological or ""magical,"" could easily move between worlds without much repercussions.

Since spirit summoning is potentially the closest anyone is capable of making contact with beings in these other worlds, I was going to have somehow use it to do just that. However, I couldn't just send an open invite, there was too much risk of something dangerous and/or completely unexpected to intercept. Basically, if there was any credibility behind the theories, anything from a wandering spirit to even passing extraterrestrials could invite themselves in. While both are potentially world-changing efforts, I also needed to restrict the intended recipient to one individual in particular. 

Think of it like this. If you wanted to make a phone call to tell a significant other you love them, you wouldn't want your call to go to the crazy lady who can talk to animals by eating rocks, would you?

Going back to the article I linked there is one person that would be the perfect candidate, as he seems to be one of the most active examples. Sensitive to paranormal energies, knowledgeable in the occult, and less likely to think themselves possibly schizophrenic if I was able to go through and speak to him; as it was he who I was trying to contact in the couple of videos I posted here.

John Constantine

 Now you see why I say this is one of the strangest cases I've dealt with. As I am certain that, maybe, Constantine himself actually responded.

Being that the latest CW crossover is supposed to wrap up soon, the official title of the case is ""The Hunt for Infinite Earths.""

But I am curious if anyone else has had their own creations come to life, or have heard such things happening. Has anyone managed to catch possible proof?"
t3_em80hn,all_ads,"Ghost Child Wandering, Calling Out For Mother",Thetruthishere,"Before you think, “Why didn’t you go and help?”, well in my defence I wasn’t much more than a child meself and this occurred while I was in bed. Both times. It happened twice. The wherabouts of my house is worth noting. I lived in an estate and my house was on the very edge of it, my bedroom being the furthest bedroom in the whole estate, the one closest to a large meadow and even larger park. Park in question involves lots of field. Trees are sparse. Nice big sycamores I must of been 12 or 13. It was very early morning, still darkish, but starting to lighten up. Those were the days where I only just found out the inhuman shrieking was the work of foxes and the weirdo donkey sounds were geese. Nowadays I am a lot more hospitable to night sounds. I have a vent on the wall next to my head, and remember my bedroom is the closest so I can hear these things the best in the house.

So it’s a child’s voice, coming from the park which is just next door. (Jump the wall and you’re there nextdoor.) Too young to put a gender to them, just a child’s voice. I assumed a five or six year old. They are calling the same word over and over, and for some reason I can’t decide exactly what word it was! IT WAS ONE WORD! I was lying there listening to it for ten minutes at least, over and over and I can’t decide if it was Mum, Mama, Mummy or something of the sort. Sounds very cliche, hm? I bet she had a white dress too. I wouldn’t know, cause I was too scaredy to look out of the window. I do hate myself for that, don’t worry. It was an eerie sound but still pure like a child. Getting louder and quieter, closer and further. As in they were actually searching across the park. I got so fed up, I was lying there with my hands over my ears until it went.

I’m just guessin but I think the next time it happened was maybe a few months to half a year later. This time around ten o clock at night. Winter, I think. Dark outside. You can imagine how I felt when the exact same child saying the exact same thing sounds again. I was braver because the rest of the house was still awake. My parents were downstairs. My two brothers next door reading in bed. Who would let a child wander around alone at such hours? Calling out for so long? This time I went in my brothers room and told them. Hear that? Yeah. They seemed to be shrugging it off. Or trying to. Ah but this time, there’s a man’s voice! He seems to call the child and speak to them and all is quiet and done and I have not heard the child since. It’s nice to think about that part. It gives you closure.

I tried to see if anyone else had something similar. (Anyone here?) I found something about a ghost girl calling her mother, around a newly moved into house, somewhere in America. I don’t remember the story exactly, but it was similar. So. Does it sound likely some children die and cannot move on or whatever they call it because they are confused and still searching for their mothers? That’s so sad. Beautiful but sad. A child‘s love and dependance for its mother is so pure. I am of course very adamant it was not a human child, unless that human child was aloud to roam free in a rough council estate at night in a park with druggies cars just outside, or managed to get lost on a spontaneous night time walk with their mother in said park with said druggies and did not cry and scream being it dark, instead calmly called out for ten or fifteen minutes, while roaming around. I am also very sure this man I heard the second time did not take a child out at night just to let them call for mummy in a dark park as a pastime. Hang on, I just had a thought. The man could of been of no familiarity to the child and just saw them and took them? Oh my god, what did I say earlier, closure? I wonder what really happened. What if he was a ghost too, and he told them, hey, you won’t find mummy here, you need to come back with me.

So there’s many potential explanations, all of which would be so strange and unlikely that a confused ghost child actually makes the most sense. What’dya think? Oh I looked out the window the second time, by the ways, but way too dark to see ought."
t3_elsp1u,all_ads,Strange screech at night.,Thetruthishere,"I live in Australia in Queensland and i usually go to sleep at 11:00pm. Then just as i close my eyes this loud screech immediately woke me up. It sounded like if some one had a dry throat with a wobbly voice. If any of you know this... creature please comment it down.

Edit:
People say it maybe a fox but my house is near the front yard and not the back. Although we do get foxes trying to get our chooks but theres no way a fox would come up to the front yard especially with cars zooming by. I can hear 2 fighting in the trees so they must be a territorial animal. Btw i live in Green Bank so that'll help i hope. 

Other edit: i heard the sound again and it sounds like squeaky shrieks but in a burst like it would go for like 7 times and then repeat 2 seconds later.

Other edit again: ok its some type of owl no ""hoots"" just shrieks"

I sounded like a howler monkey long howls but a bit deeper that were extremely loud, it howled a few times getting closer then further away then closer before I'm assuming a fight started, the only way I can put it is that it sounded like multiple farm animals being slaughter at once, their was screaming and screeching for about a minute, it sounded like someone was playing one of those slaughter videos vegans show right out side my window with speakers then silence. About 10 minutes later the howling started again still in the further then closer pattern till I ended up falling asleep. My house mate also heard it too.

t3_elwhwi,all_ads,Lost in forest,Thetruthishere,"Well!  i will make this post quickly because even to this day i am still unsure of what happened. I have to say that im french so if there’s anything not understandable im sorry. All this happened 1 year and a half ago. So near my home there is a huge forest (I live in the countryside).  I know the beginning of the forest by heart because I have lived here since I was born.  one day like the others I met a person who seemed to paint (I must say that I only go to the forest for nights because it is much more interesting).  everything was fine, I continue my road in the forest and I notice that the person I had seen was following me ... being alone I decided to take advantage of the fact that I know this part of the forest with the aim of leaving on  as quickly as possible from this person following me.  continuing my road off the small paths I get lost quickly.  I would like to specify that it must be midnight at this time, I am alone and that I am a minor.  after several minutes of racing I went to a point which I recognized easily.  I was in the abandoned building which is the furthest place in the forest I have ever visited.  so I decide to go back and try to call the police and my parents but I had no cellular network (it proves how deep I was in the forest).  I heard noises several times outside the building and it froze my blood (I was terrified).  I made the decision not to venture into unfamiliar territory and hid in a corner while waiting for the person to leave.  From there I don't really remember what happened, but the next day around (dinner time I think) I woke up and set off for my way home.  So much for the story, still to this day I have not returned to the forest in question.  my parents thought i was running away (so they called the police), they never believed my story but i know it was real. I still don’t know what this person wanted and it’s freaking me out..."

t3_eld3q8,all_ads,Angels &amp; Demons,Thetruthishere,"Shadow people, ghosts, angels, I’ve seen them all multiple times and in great detail. In 90% of these encounters I was wide awake, and a few even took place in broad daylight. 

I think all of us as humans have some connection to “the sight”. If you’ve ever seen the movie “Stir of Echoes”, a character describes it as having a flashlight. Some people’s lights turn on and off every now &amp;amp; again, they might catch a glimpse of something. For other people, the flashlight might be on all the time or remain off. 

In this world, negative entities are extremely common. I see some posts of people either interacting or trying to communicate with them and I am only saying this with the best of intentions: please be careful. Many of these entities want to harm you and they will do anything to get close to you. Once they get close to you, they are extremely difficult to get rid of. 

- Angels are tall and beautiful. 

- If you are missing a loved one who’s passed on, you don’t need a Ouija board or to pay some psychic (a few are real but most are charlatans. I work a normal office job and am not in that “industry”). Talk to your departed out loud or hold their photo and talk to it. They can hear you! You have ancestors watching over you &amp;amp; keeping your best interests at heart. You don’t need a 3rd party to access what is already yours. 

- Shadow people are dangerous AF. One tried to kill me last year. It literally attacked me. I’ve seen at least 14 in my lifetime. 

- Demons are not a joke. They are real and they will destroy you at the earliest opportunity. They are the most dangerous because they look like people in order to hide their true forms and move among us undetected. 

I know I probably sound crazy so if none of what I’ve said makes sense or appeals to you, just ignore it. 

I will likely share stories of my experiences at a later point (just joined this sub today) but I really felt compelled to write this. Please be careful. Most spirits are not your friends."
t3_elle4g,all_ads,Ozark Bedroom set haunted?,Thetruthishere,"
All of what I write are my personal true paranormal experiences. 
After my parents moved me at age 13 to the Ozark’s, where Highways met dirt roads, and dirt roads turned to rocks, a year later we moved a 1/2 mile up the road to Emy’s Place. At age 15 we took a drive down the dusty road to an estate sale. 

Now, I’d never been to one of those, but I knew who the dead man was since everyones friends with everyone in the country. 

When we arrived at the house where the estate sale was, everything was covered in dust.
I only remember a few things about his home. His furniture was covered in white sheets, and the electric had been turned off. We found a huge bedroom set.
The bed posts were monstrous, twisted and thick. My parents asked if I wanted it and like a dumbass I said yes.


It was all moved into my upstairs room. Every night I felt something jostle the edge of my bed.

My room was built in the slanted roof of the upstairs attic of a 100 year old home. My bed was pushed up against that slanted roof/wall that literally hung above me. The only way off and on my bed was the left side. 

Each night before I fell asleep I would feel the edge of the left side of my mattress depress. In other words it felt like someone was sitting down. 

Fast forward to my early 20’s. I’d moved back in with my parents and was out late one night at the pub. I’d met a cool new friend and asked if she wanted to come stay the night. Understand I’d just met her. I told her that I an older brother living out of state that she may find cute.

We drove the 45 minute drive to my home and when we got inside I was starving. I made us a snack we hauled ass upstairs. 

After that, I showed her where the bathroom was across the attic and her adjoining room. 
Since her room adjoined mine, the only way to my bathroom was to walk through my room.

The next morning I got up and tapped on her door to wake her and she was pissed. She said that my little brothers was a dick!!!”
We argued back and forth with me explaining that I didn’t have a younger brother and she asserted why she was mad.

According to her she got up in the early morning hours and there was a little boy sitting on the edge of my bed who pointed back to her room and told her to go back to bed. She was certain to the point that I had to involve my mom downstairs so she’d believe me.

I was friends with her for 6 years and occasionally I’d ask her again about the little boy but her recollection never changed, not even one word of it. She swore to me that a little boy was sitting at the side of my bed who spoke to her!

I’ve had a buttload of years to think about this and I wonder if the ghostly boy was attached to the bed?"
t3_elnmt6,all_ads,Maybe somone has an explanation,Thetruthishere,"Ok, so this is my first post here and I'm not even really sure if this post belongs here.  Anyway, my husband and I were taking our daughter to the zoo.  We were on the highway and I noticed an airplane or a jet or something flying.  But this did not look normal.  It seemed like it had a black line in front of it.  Almost like a trajectory path or something.  I mean it like went on for quite a ways.  Then all of a sudden it kinda flashed and then it was gone.  My husband also seen it and we were both kinda freaked out. We couldn't  really freak out too much because we were driving and I also don't know if anybody else seen it.  Sorry if this post doesn't make too much sense and if it doesn't belong here.  I just thought I would ask y'alls opinion."
t3_elh2th,all_ads,Christian Camp: Possible Voice of God?,Thetruthishere,"Before I begin, Let's get something straight. I'm Christian. I don't care if you believe religion is a fad, I don't care if you downvote this post cause you think all Christians are stupid, and or, you're atheist and just want to be a log about it.   
Whatever circumstance you believe in, I just want to say, You're loved and cared for. Don't let life bring you down.   


I remembered this tale, After watching ""Breakthrough"". It's a marvelous movie, I give it a 9/10. I love emotional rollercoaster movies, and it was great!  
In the movie, one of the firemen says that they heard a voice say ""Go Back"" and that struck me, after I had a similar experience.

Now, Onto the story:  


So, like my intro says, I'm Christian. I was sent to Christian Camp when I was 6 and ever since, I have loved it EVER since. I've been going for 10+ Years, and I still enjoy it (I'm planning to become a CIT next year).  
I was baptized there two years ago, and during this, I've had quite an experience.   


Around the end of the week, there is a talent show, where cabins put on skits, sing or just do something funky, and I was sitting down, across from my bunkmates. They were surrounded by girls, and I felt left out. I have an emotional disability, sorta like Anxiety, so I was mumbling under my breath ""Why God... Why did you choose me? I'm just r\*tarded... I'm not worth your time..."" ""Why am I even here!"" That's when I heard a voice. ""Look up..."" I looked around for a moment ""Who said that?"" I thought. I shrugged, and continued to watch the play ""Look up..."" it said a bit louder. I still shrugged, and continued watching ""Look up!"" I sigh, looking up at the sky, and what I saw was amazing. There was one tiny star, hovering right above me. I raised my eyebrow ""What does this mean?"" I thought. Then I looked a few feet to the left, and I see another star, and another star, and another. They were all appearing and surrounding the star above me, and a tear rolled down my cheek. I found what it was meaning. I'm the one who connects people together, I'm the one who has a large heart. I attract people around me.  


What's Crazy, is this actually comes true! I volunteer at an Elderly Home, and I play with everyone, and connect to those around me! I was born with crazy amount of heart, which comes at a fault. I'm brutally honest, and it's hard for me to lie.   


Anyway, That's my story.   
Before I end this, I want to say that I'm sorry if I seem like I'm pushing religion onto you. I just wanted to tell a small story, and I hope you guys all know, no matter your race, religion, sexuality, gender, etc, that you are all LOVED. L-O-V-E-D! Don't forget it!!"
t3_elkcm8,all_ads,Puzzling incident camping ..,Thetruthishere,"This happened in 1983 when I was 8, we had gone camping with our class and teachers. The day went on and it was great cause none of us had ever been camping. 

It gets to around 5pm and all the kids are whispering and everyone was on edge and the classmates said there was ‘something’ in the toilets so myself and a boy went into investigate. 

It was dead silent in the toilet block we couldn’t even hear our teachers anymore or the guitar one of them was strumming. 

We didn’t find anything but when we got out it had grown really, really dark and the campfire was going and our classmates rushed up to us saying we’d been gone for a very long time and our teachers were on edge. 

I don’t know what happened except we got distracted by a tiny dirty window. 

Got swept under the rug like it never happened the next day and left me really confused and my friends and teachers forgot the incident way too fast considering how panicked they were the night before."
t3_em0ql7,all_ads,Offended by the TRUTH? GOOD! Breaking illusion.,Thetruthishere,"SHHHHH.... don't think, just read and comprehend. Then think. Thinking while listening is not listening, it is preparing to argue. And arguing is a waste of breath. Now a debate, that can be done. Everyone can teach you something. You may have to re-read (that is if you care to, personal authority is what makes people pay attention as i am not present i can't do that)

Illusion (a front, a facade) (Dis-illusion; Not falling for the facade) They will call you insane, because you don't fall for their bullshit. I love it when people get offended by the TRUTH. They act all prissy like a child having a fit, GOOD it means progress on them. Not myself, i've about hit my ceiling on progress. You think i haven't been through all the thoughts feelings and everything you have when your illusion is shattered? People can't handle REAL TRUTH. But WHY? BECAUSE, to the simple human mind. Beneficial= good (and they want to use you for something, nothing is free) Pain= Bad. HOWEVER, there is NO growth without PAIN. I offer this to you, because i want to see progress so MY suffering wasn't for nothing within the scheme of the imagined humanity. I owe it to my human self, this is called loving yourself. I'm GIVING you POWER. The secret to personal growth. EMPATHY, PERSPECTIVE, UNDERSTANDING. Use it. With. Every.Thing. THAT'S IT. SHUT UP and LISTEN, BEFORE SPEAKING. You have free will, yes? Not right now you don't. You are taught like a dog what to do from birth. Parents need to understand, that. YOU are a separate entity. You may have gotten your body from their line, but your soul is your soul. But.... WHO ARE YOU? You will have to KNOW THY SELF to answer that. To those who claim to know ""God"" How can you know ""God"" without knowing yourself first? Illogical. The scientist can't study without a specimen---that is yourself, your real self--soul (sol, inner sun) Naturally, the strong dominate the weak. As i am one of the top dogs in existence, i generously offer to help you---help yourself."
t3_elptuu,all_ads,Haunting or something else??,Thetruthishere,
t3_elkxw4,all_ads,Devil in the back,Thetruthishere,One of my late friend’s told me a story about his uncles back in the day. They told him they were drinking at this bar long ago till closing time. They jumped in their truck which had a canopy in the back and you could get into the canopy from the cab of the truck. They were drunk and driving down the highway when something was crawling into cab with them. They said it was all scruffy and had horns. Without hesitation they both bailed out of the truck while it was moving. They forgot there was a bed in canopy and their uncle was passed out. He woke up and tried crawling in the front and his nephews bailed out and he had to grab the steering wheel to save himself. Their uncle had long messy hair which looked like horns i guess lol
t3_elbt1b,all_ads,Dogman changed me forever!,Thetruthishere,"I live in southern Ohio near the ohio river. Myself and a few friends decided to go explore the abandoned hospital that backed up to a giant hill and large forest across the river in Maysville Kentucky. It was a local spot for dumb teenagers to go and scare each other and play grab ass with their girlfriends, so running into other people wasn't uncommon but you could usually tell if other people were there cuz there would be cars parked near it. That being said on this night we were the only dumb teenagers there. 

     The moment we got out of the car though everything felt wrong. We knew we weren't allowed to be there cuz the building was condemned but this felt like we were actually in danger. Which of course we always were cuz it was condemned lol, but it just felt different. 

     Now by this point I had been to Hazewood hospital 20 times or so and I was familiar with the layout. 
Once the 3 of us had gotten inside we had been there about 45 minutes when we split up to tag some different places and explore. I went to go take pictures of the morgue in the basement to see if I could photograph any orbs or anything really cool. I had been in the morgue for about 10 minutes when I smelled the most foul smell I've ever smelled. It was rot. 

      I don't know what it was that was rotting I imagine it was a large dog or a coyote but all I could make out was it was about 40 pounds of rotting meat. I had just started to look at the meat chunk when I heard the slam of a steel door and what sounded like running through puddles of water. Which meant whatever it was it was in the basement with me cuz the floor had about 3 inches of water standing in it.

     So naturally I figured it was my shitty friend's playing a prank on me. That was when I decided to get them back, and scare them before they could scare me. Now the way the morgue was set up you could actually climb on top of the coolers they used to store the bodies so I hopped up there and laid in wait to scare the shit out of my friends and I had been there no more than a minute when I heard screaming. 

      Now I've known my friends my entire life, which at this point had been 19 years. I've never heard screaming like this. The screaming stopped and I heard hard footsteps running above me and what I can best describe as pounding. Now I'd be lying if I said I wasn't freaking out a little cuz this wasn't like my friends. It was usually hide behind a corner and jump out and go ""got ya"". This was different, this was dread I was starting to feel. 

     As I continued to lay there about 5 minutes passed when I heard panting, and footsteps in the water. They were getting closer. That was when I smelled wet dog. But it wasn't just wet dog I was smelling I was smelling that same smell of rot too. Then another steel door slammed and I could tell it was the same door I passed before I got to the morgues door. The panting was even louder now and honestly it sounded more like labored breathing and sniffing. 

       Now at this point I'm terrified I'm trying to slowly back away from the edge of the cooler I'm on so I can slip behind the wall the cooler backs up to and drop into the boiler room. I'm almost to the end of the cooler when I hear the morgue door slam open and break the tiles on the wall with the door handle. I'm less than 35 feet from whatever is panting and smelling like death, and all I can do is think run, run, run! I could hear the sniffing and then I heard the deepest most menacing growl I've ever heard. The movies and shows dont do justice to just how deep and rough a growl of this size sounds. 

       It was sniffing me out, it was actually smelling where I had been. I dropped down behind the wall in the boiler room and I thanked god the door that connected the morgue to it was blocked with old gurneys and a locker on its side which I thought would stop this thing from getting in. I was wrong so very wrong. I hadn't been in the boiler room 30 seconds before I heard the pounding/ scratching on the steel door. It sounded like Freddy Kruger was trying to carve his way through the steel door. Then I heard the sound that still haunts me to this day. It howled and I mean it bellowed a howl so loud I had to cover my ears. 

        Now on the other side of the boiler room was the access to the generator and the dock doors trucks used to unload and the hillside that lead to the woods. When I reached the other side of the room I could hear this thing slamming into the door and knocking the lockers away and the gurneys. I opened the door to the dock room and when I looked back I saw the arm of this creature sticking through the opening it had made and it was like a horror movie. 

      It was a gray and brown mass of fur but it looked like a human arm but it didn't cuz the hand was all wrong. The hand had five digits but the claws would have made a bear run in fear. I slammed the door behind me and ran for the dock doors. The dock doors wouldn't budge and I could hear the gurneys overturning and the lockers sliding on the floor, it was getting through and the only thing between me and it now was a single door. I ran to one of the windows by the dock doors and proceeded to bust it out which mangled my hand from the glass. Then as I was pulling myself through the window I heard the door get slammed into and one of the hinges completely flew off the door and hit the wall. I tumbled out of the window and hit the cold wet ground. When I stood up I saw it in the doorway. 


       Now I'm 6'4 250 lbs, not little by any means, and this thing took up the entire doorway an 8 foot tall 3 foot wide door. It was covered head to toe in gray brown fur, and it had a very narrow snout almost like a doberman pincher and its ears were just barely visible cuz of the doorway, but I could tell they were pointing up just like a dogs. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, I was completely paralyzed. This thing was staring right into my soul, looking at every delicious part it was going to enjoy I've never felt like an item on a menu but I can tell you its terrifying. Then it snarled and that woke me from my disbelief of what I was seeing. I turned and ran, I ran up the hill into the woods to get around the hospital to get back to the street where the car was parked. I hadn't made it 25 feet when I heard it clawing to get out the window. I knew I would never make it to the car this way. 

    So I ran back towards the hospital where the fire escape ladder was. I had used the ladder before to climb to the roof to take pictures of the entire town. I completely skipped the first 3 rungs on the ladder and was now inside the enclosed part of the fire escape. Again this thing howled and I could feel waves of pure terror filling my body. My hand was killing me at this point and I was getting blood on everything and just as I was reaching the first floor window I could climb into this thing slammed into the fire escape ladder, knocking me down a couple rungs. It leaped onto the outside of the fire escape and began clawing at my feet, just as I reached the window I felt it. Pain like nothing I've ever felt. It had grabbed just above my ankle and yanked, and in doing so shredded my boot the end of my Jean's and my flesh. I was able to pull myself into the first floor window and I heard it push itself off the fire escape and head back the way it came. 

      Now at this point I'm dragging my left leg and trying to keep my right hand in my hoodie pocket. The entrance we came in from is only about 150 feet away down the main hall and around a left turn. As I'm half way down the hall I hear the steel doors slamming again. I'm dragging myself down the hall just trying to stay focused on getting out of this hell hole, then the howling starts again and I can hear it getting closer. I make the turn and hear the pounding coming up the stairs from the basement. I make it to the entrance and hear the patting of hands and feet on the floor. I made the mistake of looking back just as it rounded the corner and it was running on all fours like a real dog! I bolted down the hill towards the street where the car was parked and realized the car was gone! They left me! 

     My only way of escape was gone! I just zoned out and kept running down the hill my leg was throbbing my hand was in agony and all I could think was I'm going to be fucking dog kibble. Finally I made it to the first house I could find and ran full force into the door and began pounding on it like a crazy person and thank god this little old lady was home cuz she opened the door and I literally fell inside and just before I kicked the door closed standing up on 2 legs at the end of her driveway was this monster. I broke down in tears, I didn't know what to do luckily the old lady had called the cops because a crazy person who was bleeding everywhere just fell into her home. 

     When the cops got there and asked me what happened I told them the same thing I've said here and of course they didn't believe me and thought I was on drugs. The EMTS took me to the hospital and when they did blood work and found no substance in my system they then concluded I was attacked by a wild dog. I ended up with 36 stitches in my leg and 17 in my hand. I had to get rabies shots and tell the local wild life officer my story. He informed me that they had reports of wild dog packs running around the outside of town ransacking garbage cans and killing some of the local pets, and I informed him that it wasn't a pack of wild dogs it was a giant dogman but they all just thought I was crazy. The only thing I had in my favor was the claw mark on my leg, even the doctor's were confused about how a wild dog could make a mark like that. 
       

     Now you know my story and you know why I absolutely know we are not at the top of the food chain. I've never been back to Hazewood hospital and I've deterred anyone from ever going there. That experience has haunted me for the last 11 years of my life, it has made me into the over cautious man I am. I always have to know where every exit is when I walk into a building and I ALWAYS know where large clumps of woods are. This experience changed me forever and it changed the way I look at the world we live in. Just because we all haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist it just means some people haven't been hunted for their life. I have no doubt what stalked me that night was the dogman, I know it in my bones."
t3_elfprd,all_ads,Black Cat,Thetruthishere,"I was raised Catholic and attended a Catholic school from pre-K to 6th grade. I was an anxiety ridden child to say the least. I took everything I learned very seriously. I don’t know why I want to share this, it was probably my own anxiety ridden brain and nothing paranormal but I still think about it from time to time. I went into a deep depression after my grandmother died in 1st grade. Death became very real to me. I never stopped worrying. It wasn’t  death I was scared of but the burning in hell for eternity, that was the fear. I obsessed over sin, I remember I once wrote my initials (in pencil..quite the badass) under the see-saw at recess. Ok, very harmless, but I obsessed for 6 months and just knew I had committed a sin of some sort and was destined to be tortured in the pits of hell for, yup, eternity. I think during this time a spirit attached to me. I had bunkbeds and shared with my younger sister. I would be trying to fall asleep and the bed would sway back and forth. I would get enough nerve to peek down at my sister and she would be sleeping soundly. This happened a lot. I also remember this time I woke in the middle of the night. There was a loud banging sound. It sounded like an ax chopping wood. It was so loud. My whole body turned cold and I ran into my parents room and it stopped. I’m 34 now and I still remember every detail to that night. I’ve never hallucinated before or since. We also took a trip to Williamsburg around that time. My mom wanted to go into an old General Store and I remember this fear coming over my whole body, I refused to walk, I wouldn’t go into the store. I remember my mom being super irritated- but something with the lighting and the feeling of the store made me sick and scared shitless. I also wasn’t sleeping well around this time, I had to say Hail Mary a number of times to keep satan away. I was a really cool kid... the more I write the more I think I should stop. So anyway. One night I look out the window and I see a blue orb in the neighbors yard. I didn’t know what it was but it was just floating around. It was mesmerizing. I kept closing and opening my eyes to see if it would disappear. It stayed floating for a few minutes and the last time I closed my eyes and opened them it was gone. It didn’t scare me, and everything scared me at that time. A few days later getting off the bus there was a little black kitten that seemed to wait for me, coming from that yard. My mom ended up letting me keep him. He was the sweetest cat. After that cat came I never had those dreadful feelings again. It’s like they all went away, I wasn’t scared anymore. Even to this day, I have gotten depressed sure, but it doesn’t come close to those feelings I had as a child. I don’t know what it was. This was long. Thanks for reading."
t3_elhzpm,all_ads,"The Barge, Train and Motorcycle: My first hand experience with a bright blue-white orb",Thetruthishere,"It’s an honor to be able to share this incredible sighting and true story with you all. I shortly debated on moving this post to a different sub but I think this will do. 

In the summer of 2011, I was 15 years old when a couple of friends of mine were hanging at my house for the night. Thomas (best friend to this day), Anthony (Ex best friend) and I were invited to a small hangout in the neighborhood so we snuck out and went. We started to have a lot of fun and convinced one of the older guys there to pick up our other really good friend that lived way out in the countryside. Once Robert arrived we did boy stuff, being loud, obnoxious and what not. Soon the get together ended and Robert needed a ride home so I did what I usually did; stole my moms 2001 Ford Taurus while she was asleep and drove him. 

Now his house is actually about a 15-20 minute windy dark ride to the countryside. He lived in the woods and had some farm animals. We drove him there seeing deer as usual but nothing out of the ordinary happened until our way back...

This gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. 

On the way back to town there is this very long straight stretch of road that’s maybe 2-3 miles long at best. On the east side of the road is the Mississippi River but between the road and river are train tracks. On the west side of the road is a large cement plant. But most of the straight path of the road the west side is a very large and tall cliff. So if you’re looking down the road facing north, from left to right it’s cliff, road, train tracks and then river. 

So we’re driving, smoking cigarettes in my mom’s car not really giving a shit as usual until I notice a blue-white light in the rear view mirror. I softly tell the guys “hey look there’s a barge on the river.” 

Thomas is sitting shotgun and Anthony is sitting passenger back seat. 

One of the boys reply “oh yeah it is a barge.” Then the other says “that’s not a barge... that’s a train.” 

So at this point, we don’t notice it until a moment later, but this light is traveling above the surface of the river and then moves leftward towards the roads

As I’m looking through my side mirror I do indeed see a train light or so I thought at the time. The light moved closer and was on the road now. “Is that motorcycle? What the fuck is that?” I asked.

Now we’re panicking. This strange thing just defied our logic. I mean we’re really shitting bricks here all alone. 
 
It was so bright. Brighter than any high beams I’ve ever seen. Brighter than any flashlight or anything else for that matter. It got so close it lit up the entire inside of the car and the area around us outside. 

I put the pedal to the metal thinking we could escape and outrun the light. I remember hitting 80mph and the light had no problem staying within 20-30 feet of the ass end. I remember asking Anthony to look and tell me what he saw because I was too focused on driving. I turned around and saw eyes peep over the back seat staring directly at it. I’ve never seen his eyes that wide before. Thomas also looks like he’s making eye contact with a ghost. 

The road slightly bends left up a hill and the train tracks lead into the woods. It stayed on our ass until the road bends and I remember looking out the passenger window. The light was parallel to us. Right next to us. As we stayed on the road the light kept straight and not long after entering the woods it completely vanished. It didn’t go behind trees or something like that, we didn’t loose sight, it was there then it wasn’t. Completely vanished out of thin air. 

We all screamed. Shocked, scared and confused we cussed and questioned everything on the rest of the ride back. Completely mind fucked. 

I didn’t know what that thing was then but today I know: pure energy"
t3_ekxp0m,all_ads,Any other empaths picking up on some seriously weird energy?,Thetruthishere,"Me and my best friend aren't what I would call ""psychic"" but we're both extreme empaths. I've had dreams of things happening before they happen in real life, I am really good at picking up on people's vibes and energy especially relationships between people, and I've always felt really spiritual and superstitious, mostly believing in Native American shaman traditions (I live in Colorado close to the mountains) and Irish/Celtic spiritual beliefs (my family is Irish and I feel very connected to my ancestors). A lot of this makes me sound batshit crazy and yeah some of it is probably just being adept to reading body language/interpreting people's language like connotations, etc. I only ever talk about it with my best friend since she's more in tune with the spirit world than I am. I feel like this is a good community to ask if any other empaths feel the way we do. 

This entire last semester for me has felt extremely off. Part of it was my grandfather, who passed away a few days before Christmas. I woke up two or three times in the middle of the night around when he died and just knew something was wrong. I thought that might explain the unease and dread I've felt since August but these feelings haven't gone away. My throat is tight all the time, I feel drained and fatigued, no matter how much I sleep. I get random scratches on my body. I see stereotypical bad omens like a bunch of crows where I've never seen them hanging out before. I've had premonitions and ""bad feelings"" before but nothing that feels as big and ominous as this. Am I just going crazy, or are other people picking up on these vibes as well?"

I was in the backseat of my friend's mom's car and we were driving on the highway. I was just looking out the window and I see a man who looks exactly like my grandfather. He was driving in a red convertible, and he looks over and smiles at me. I thought about it for a couple moments and look back up to see there's no one on the road in a red convertible. I have always wondered what it could mean or maybe he is just wanted to say goodbye? But on the highway just seems like an unusual spot to 'say goodbye' or maybe its just a random man that looks like my grandfather on the highway?"

Well, how can I start this? The last November I had a weird experience, I still don't know if I was dreaming or it's asleep paralysis case ( Or that's what I am telling myself).

Basically, since last year I always sleep late (2 to 3 am), but that day I had a strange/weird feeling. After shutting down my pc and jumping into my bed, I felt uncomfortable but I succeed to sleep.

First, I was in a dream: I was standing in front of a wall wich had Grafity and some stuff written there ( I couldn't read ) and I couldn't see behind me or move. I was hearing too many noises and the dream atmosphere was too weird, I heard someone yelling my name and other voices pointing him to my direction( he's right there kinda thing), I was too scared and I tried to wake up by blinking my eyes too fast (Usually that what I used to do when I had nightmares as a kid ).

I Woke up laying on my back and I could move only my arms and my eyes but not the rest of my body, I started breathing (inhale/exhale) too fast to remove that heart-pounding feeling of my chest. I moved my eyes near the door ( My bed is at the right corner of the room so the door was on my left ) and I saw a dark figure ( Darker than black, too dark ) coming to me too fast, and when it came closer to my face, the creature started whispering something that I couldn't understand and getting closer and closer to my mouth, I moved my right arm and tried to touch the figure but I ended up touching something that seemed like hair ( I can't explain how that felt, just like touching a rock with a bit of hair on it ).

The Dark Figure disappeared and I was too scared to move the rest of my body ( i got back my body control ) I turned to my right side and closed my eyes trying to go back to sleep believing that I was dreaming.

It was a strange experience, I still don't know if I was dreaming or awake but I believe I was dreaming, the type of Dream in a Dream situation or maybe a sleep paralysis case."
t3_el8gzk,all_ads,The Knife &amp; Man That Killed 65 people,Thetruthishere,"During a dream more real than life, I found myself sitting by a man on a log looking over the ocean.  I knew who he was. Long face, tan skin, big nose, blue eyes like a hawk, cool beard, loving heart.  He said “Would you hold the knife your friend left? you need to see it’s history” the previous day my friend picked up a worn, foreign government type knife at a garage sale, and gave it to me to add to a collection of 3 other cheap knives I had.   I had told him to put it on the table. 

When I woke up I went into the room with the old army knife, knowing the pains it likely held. I felt it’s blade.  Then I could see...  A young boy with wavy brown hair... somewhere in Europe, in his early teens...  his mom had been sexually abused a lot but she kept strong.  She had always told him that monsters rule this world, and monsters are needed to fight them.  I saw his innocent eyes look up at her, only partially understanding.  Years later he joins the military and is tracking down some people, I don’t know what or why.  He find a few innocent people who had been impaled on long sticks.  He vomited.  He had eaten some sort of bread with honey for breakfast.  I felt like I could taste it coming out of him mixed with stomach acids.  The leader turned to the group of soldiers and announced, with dark lustful eyes, that their task was now a hunting trip.  They tracked down the bad men who impaled the innocent people. The soldiers did worse things to those captured men than they had done to the innocents.  The leader puts a knife in the wavy/brown haired mans hand.  He explained that cutting a throat is for stories only.  The way to kill a man is to stick a knife up his bottom so it hit his spine.  Great for stealth takedowns.  It’s easier to do than cutting a throat and the target instantly drops without noise because of shock caused to the spine.  The leader guides the waive/brown haired mans hand teaching him how to do it on one of the men they captured.  He feels the strange moment when he hits the victim’s spin, and their body goes limp.  He hates it. But remembers his mothers words that monsters rule the world, and monsters are needed to fight them.  He remembers the bad men who hurt his mom, he would become a monster to kill the evil men of this world. I see his life flash forward years, he keeps that knife and uses it over and over.  Often stabbing up toward the spine like he had been taught.  I saw the number of people the knife had killed:65. I saw their faces, I don’t know how I knew it was 65, I didn’t count them one by one, but I knew.  I realize the wavy brown haired guy is a grown man about to leave the military.  He looks in the mirror and realizes he was never able to make the world any better by becoming a monster.  He shoots himself through a bunch of pillow to keep it quieter, he dies all alone.  He’s found, the usual steps are taken for a funeral but one of his friends takes his knives, he collects that stuff.  He gets out of the military, immigrates to my country.  Customs destroys all his gun collection when he enters the country but let’s him keep his knives.  He had left the knife out while thinking of his wavy haired friend, and that day his wife grabbed it for a garage sale where my friend bought it.  I go walk by his house, he has military netting over his vegetable garden, haha :) i like his truck he painted it camouflage colors. I knock on the door, the man opens it.  I tell him my friend bought this knife from his garage sale on accident and I’m here to give it back.  He looks at it and tells me to keep it because I remind him of his friend who used to own it. I take it home and bury it deep in the ground in nearby woods. Idk but maybe i could taste that bread/honey tasting vomit in my mouth. 

I dreamed again the next night.  I was sitting on the bench by the sea with the guy with the long face, big nose, blue hawk eyes and loving soul.  He says “what did you learn?” I said. “I learned you can’t make the world better by fighting evil with evil.” He looks at me, he expected me to say that.  Then he says “so... how do you fight evil?”  I wake up.

Update: Deleted this account but I’m keeping this post up because it’s true."
t3_el7elz,all_ads,Gonna stop the Skinwalker stories for awhile,Thetruthishere,"Hey guys, recently I posted 2 skinwalker encounters, one I had and one my cousin D had. I love that you guys are so open to me telling my stories as no one ever believes me unless they know me. Since telling these stories to you all a couple of odd things have been happening and I just don’t feel like talking about it that much for the moment. 

I still have 2 more experiences to share about skinwalkers and may have one of my friends tell me theirs. But I will wait for a while until I feel a little more safe to share them. In the meantime I will share some other things that have happened. I live in a very old town and have traveled to “haunted” places and will share my/friends encounters with paranormal entities with those. 

I will also share some more meaningful experiences, ones that made me change my mind and ways. I plan on posting one tomorrow. If there is anything specific you’d like to hear about let me know and I’ll see if anyone I know has had an encounter or knows of one. 

Thank you all for giving me your support and letting me share my experiences. :)"
t3_el53ma,all_ads,Black silhouette of trench coat/hat man in my room,Thetruthishere,"I'm writing this to see if anyone can give me their input on what I saw some years back. I was 14 or 15 years old when this happened and back then I had my computer in my room.  I woke up in the middle of the night for I don't know what reason (this isn't common for me) to be instantly spooked. What I saw was a figure of a man in my chair contrasting with the bright light coming from my monitor. He seemed to be wearing a coat and a brimmed hat, but I guess I only really saw his upper half and there were no details... just all black. I only saw it for a second before I shut my eyes out of instinct. As if somehow that was going to protect me... I could feel my heart beating fast. I was scared. I didn't hear anything but next I felt a lot of heat in my face/cheeks. I started praying because that's the only thing I could do at the time. I couldn't build up the courage to open my eyes again or even move. I don't know how long I was laying there praying before I finally fell asleep again. I woke up in the morning and looked at my chair again. There was nothing there. No clothes or anything that maybe could have tricked my mind. I never saw this or anything like it again, but I've always wondered what it was or if I was crazy or something. I also still don't really understand how my monitor was on. I have a bad habit on keeping my computer on at night, but I think that I would have had some kind of sleep mode or something.   


This was also about 12 or 13 years ago though so some details are fuzzy. I decided to write this today because my cousin brought it up and I've been wondering if anyone else has seen this too or can give me an explanation of what it was."

I was asleep on the top of a bunk bed in my room, awoke in the night and to my left looking down at me was a black face with wide, fiery eyes and its mouth partly open. It's almost as if it was surprised I saw it. I was staring at it for a time, frozen and then I rolled back over to sleep.

t3_el3l4b,all_ads,I really need your help / advice,Thetruthishere,"Hi everyone. So long story short, i had a case of sleep paralysis only once in my life. It was in my old room in my old house about 5 years ago. I was just lying in bed when i woke up, saw a figure walk into my room, stand right next to me and you know the story, i couldn't move etc. 

When I hear other peoples sleep paralysis stories, the ""demon"" or whatever it is, is always really scary and chokes them etc. 
To me - my one wasn't scary. I just felt another entity and I felt safe with them, I just didn't like the fact I couldn't move or speak. 

Anyways, after this experience I kept having ""sleep paralysis"" well so this is what I need your help and advice with because I don't think it is sleep paralysis. 
This is so hard to explain but basically this is what happens
* i can't move
* i can't talk 
* i start shaking (i have never had this when someone else is in the bed with me as well so i don't know if i'm actually shaking but I think i am - because i'm awake through this and it isn't a dream, and i can feel myself shaking) 
* sometimes i will have a vision through this, sometimes it will be scary and sometimes not 
* sometimes i don't have a vision, my eyes are open and its just me in my room, litterally shaking and not being able to move 
* MOST of the time, i'm not scared, if anything, its annoying and irritating because i need to go to sleep and this is prolonging 
* i believe this happens to me just before entering REM sleep 
* i have to wake myself up from this but sometimes its harder then other times because i genuinely can not move i have to focus so deep into my mind to move my head and jolt myself to wake up
* when i wake up from it i'm still half a sleep so i fall back into it a lot of the time, i have to physically pull myself out of bed sometimes and then go back to bed for it to stop - but then sometimes it will start back over 

I'm over it. I need your help or advice please &amp; thank you 
I tried explaining this the best way i could but please let me know if you have further questions
I have done so much research online but can't find anything similar to this -  everything i see online about sleep paralysis involves a demon sitting on someone or something but that never happens with mine?! + i'm shaking! 

I'm open to any advice but please try not bring this down to medical conditions because i am quite spiritally intuned and believe it something more on the spiritual side of things + have no medical conditions or on my mum n dads side (i'm a 22f) 

ALSO i got quite into trying to be able to astral project at one time and if anyone else has, that shaking feeling you get - it kind of feels like that? I've been to scared to keep it going because i have an anxiety of death and i get scared i'm gonna die lol so i'll always wake myself up from this so called ""sleep paralysis"""

t3_eks1cu,all_ads,"Encounter With Tall Nightcrawler Aka ""Sisiutl"", ""S?i:łqəý"", ""Supernatural Being"" (B.C Canada, Seen in 5 Acre Forest, Northwest Rural part of my city)",Thetruthishere,"This experience was the only paranormal experience I've ever had, probably the only one that I will ever have in my life and was one of the two most spiritual/terrifying experiences I have ever had. I am 26 years old, this experience still scares me to this day , I will never forget walking out of that forest that night and I will remember it for the rest of my life. If anyone has had an experience/encounter with something like this please let me know in the comments. I've looked all over the internet and reddit for encounters that were identical to mine or even similar and there are absolutely no encounters like mine.

 I am already well aware of the Nightcrawler videos, I wasn't aware of the videos till a couple years after my encounter/experience. I have seen the Fresno Nightcrawler videos many times, the movements looked way more terrfying and ""psychedelic"" in real life compared to the videos, and it looked a lot more ghostly/spirit like. It was visually stunning/haunting compared to the videos and something you would have to witness/experience for yourself. The one we saw stayed in the same exact spot the whole time we saw it. It did not walk anywhere like the ones in the videos and there were some differences in appearance. 

Yosemite/Fresno and the Lowermainland/Fraser Valley are about a 16 hour drive apart but they are both connected by a long strip of forest areas that consist of other national parks and national forests that are right on the edge of the North Pacific Ocean. 

I sent a drawing I did of the Being to someone that was First Nations on instagram that lives in B.C not to far from me and he knew what it was right away, told me what the name of the Being was in his their language and showed me their cultures ""High Status Symbol"" which was a ""Double Headed Serpent"" shaped like a U I was told to flip upside down because it represents the beings. I was told a little bit of other information and told to make a specific burial offering. I did some recent some research based off of what he told me and I found out some of the other various names different First Nations cultures call the ""Nightcrawlers"" here in BC, Canada. I posted them at the very bottom of my encounter below the TL;DR with other research I took off the internet about them. 

I was also told by another First Nations person that lives in the same city as me "" If you do go outside at night don't eat or drink anything"", ""Ask before you enter forests"", and ""it is best to keep your distance from them""

Here is a screenshot my friends old house and some of the 5 acre forest with the spots marked out where we approximately were and where we saw the Tall White Being. https://imgur.com/a/LTRKbfS

Here is the rough drawing I made of ""exactly"" what the Tall White ""Supernatural Being"" looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O](https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O)

Here: [https://imgur.com/a/8C6ytrX](https://imgur.com/a/8C6ytrX) is me and my friends conversation a year after we saw the Being (2011 when I was 17) I dug up in my facebook messages. I clearly hadn't spoken to my friend in a while and I say ""I can't stop thinking about the figure we saw in his forest"", I say ""the feeling I had when I saw it was death"", he states ""hes never been as scared since"", ""he was worried to tell anyone about it"" and he was ""Mesmerized by its movements""

Here is the Fresno Nightcrawler video without sound, this is the closest someone will ever get to the real experience due to how silent it was and how silent the forest was. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nMqja9d6M4

Here is another video of one a user recently told me about after reading my experience. They said it was off of a documentary called ""Beyond The Spectrum: Humanoids"" The being was cloaked at the time and not visible to the naked eye but it's prescence could be felt, the camera captured it and a kid on third base kept looking back at it. It was captured on the camera at a Baseball game in Juarez Mexico.

Encounter/experience:

Back in 2010 in Lowermainland/Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada approximately in early October or mid October when I was 16 (I am 26 years old now) My old friend lived in the northwest rural part of my city(has a lot of forest area and farm land as I posted) His backyard has 5 acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance around the outskirts of the forest. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander. This one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at about 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint like usual (Which we were sober at the time and did'nt even get to smoking because of encountering the ""Being"" and being terrified, we ended up smoking it inside his basement/room).

There's a steep cliff made out of forest floor when you first walk in. It is only about 20 -25 feet into the forest area from the ""entrance"" of the forest.
When we were standing at the top of the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest and the creek at the bottom which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a 7-8 feet tall pure white soft looking figure and it was inbetween the trees moving around softly swaying left to right back and forth slowly standing (touching the forest floor) in the exact same place the whole time we saw it making absolutely no sound and there was absolutely no wind. 

I wasn't even going to say anything about the figure to my friend at first because I was waiting for my friend to say something. We observed it for a couple seconds in complete silence and we were ""mesmerized"" by it's movements, then I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yeah he could as well. We stood silent in fear as we were watching it do its strange unsettling soft swaying movements/trying to adjust our eyes to the Being and see what it was doing. As we continued watching it for a couple minutes I felt I was in a slight daze watching it sway and I started to feel impending doom ""set in"" (the sinking feeling) in my chest area like when you are going to die or are in a life threatening situation and I had shivers going throughout my body. That's when I told my friend specifically ""I don't like this"", he agreed and we left immediately. I wasn't so much scared of the sight of the Being, I was more curious about the strange movements it was making and what it really looked like, I was scared of the feeling of death it made me feel. I was frozen with fear and I literally felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen.

We left very quick because we did'nt know what it was, it scared us and our intuition (my feeling of dread/death) told us it was dangerous, we did'nt want to go check out what it was and I knew it was time to leave. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am entirely positive the dog was whimpering and the Being was just still swaying back and forth left to right between the trees in the same exact same spot. Almost immediately after we got out of the forest (left the ""entrance"" of the forest (which we were not far from) it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and the feeling of dread left pretty much immediately.

The Supernatural Being was just white long limbs seemed to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30 - 40 feet away from us below around the pathway we would take down to the rest of the forest. It was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light or moon light shining in the forest because it was filled with tall pine trees/other vegetation had various leveling's. It was not a spiderweb or any sort of garbage (we had gone back in the morning daylight and saw nothing out of the ordinary). His forest is pristine condition cause no one ever goes in it, there is no garbage.  There were no houses close enough to give off any light or give off a shine through the trees and the Being was not see through it looked like it was almost solid, but it was very ghostly/spirit looking as well. It was upside down V or U shaped and It had no facial features/head at all from what we could see in the dark.

It was so white it looked like it was almost shining but it wasn't because it was'nt giving of any light of any sort or illuminating the ground or trees around it, you could see the shadow being cast on while it was swaying in the pitch black forest like it was a real animal. It looked solid enough to the point where you couldn't see through it at all, it was solid white. It appeared to be three dimensional. It looked soft and kind of shiny, it was swaying left to right, right to left with its two really long arms, it looked bulky/strong at the top and shoulder areas and where a head would be but there was no head that I could see. The two long legs/arms almost looked like if how the front view of a ape crawling on all fours would look like, as if they were hunched infront. The best way I can describe it is 7-8 foot thin separated curtains in the shape of a upside down V or U touching the forest floor and swaying left to right back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Its movements were ""Psychedelic"" and sort of ""hypnotizing"". It was soft like Charlies white spirit entering Peters body after the attic scene from ""Hereditary"" Probably the most solid description I can give of what it looked like. It was making no sound at all while it was swaying, it was beautiful to look at and terrifying/unsettling at the same time, that's why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic. There were absolutely no sounds in the forest, it was dead silent while it was moving back and forth. Its movements could have been a lure of some sort because it did not move towards us or anywhere, or it was just letting us know to stay away because it was scared to death as well or just didn't want us to disturb it. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie. 

There is absolutely no animals in Northern British Columbia, Canada or the rest of Canada and U.S that look close to what we saw, there are absolutely no animals that are 7-8 feet tall and stand on 2 legs. It did not have a body( It's 2 legs/limbs were its body) It was not a animal, and there is no possible way to ""debunk"" this. I have explored all the options of what it could have been. This was the first time we ever went out to his forest at night, and it was the last time we ever went in the forest at night. The 5 acres of forest is the biggest area of woods in that area. Around the area of town it is mostly just a couple million dollar houses, and farm/forest area. It is pretty much the greenbelt of my city. He has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is 5 acres with the closest neighbors being at least 3 blocks down the street on the right hand side of the forest. To this day the feeling that I had when I saw the Being move still gives me shivers. The fact that we went out to the forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen it in his forest at that moment of time. Like I said, I didn't have to point out to my friend where the Being was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it. I think the feeling of dread could have possibly have been a warning to keep away from it and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. 

This was my only Parnaormal Experience I have ever had. There was no paranormal activity that I experienced when I would go to my friends house or on his property/ in his forest besides the one experience/encounter, but now that I think back on hanging outside there and exploring the woods there is for sure something ""special"" about the whole location. I understand a lot of people are scared of these types of things and they don't want to believe they exist, but would have had to be there yourself to understand what it looked like, see the creeping movements, and feel what I felt. Seeing one of these beings upclose is a spiritual experience that you need to experience and see for yourself to really understand what it was like. We have scaled my friends forest including the area where we saw the Supernatural Being at least 20 different times/ different days before hand seeing it and we went back the day after to the exact spot where we saw the Being in the forest and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.  We both knew that it was some sort of being and it was something we shouldn't have been seeing or attempt to go up to.

Here is my full description of the ""Supernatural Being"" Aka Nightcrawler, me and my friend saw:

7-8 feet Tall, Pure White (When I mean ""pure white"" I mean Paper, Bone white) Not see-through, Just 2 Pure White Long limbs (from what we could see in the dark). It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was'nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, it looked bulky/strong at the top and shoulder areas and where a head would be but there was no head that I could see. It looked solid and looked three dimensional.  I can only describe as 7-8 foot shiny separated curtains in the shape of a upside down V or U with some sort of bulkiness/shape to the top half, the whole thing was swaying touching the forest floor right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. The two long legs/arms almost looked like if how the front view of a ape crawling on all fours would look like, as if they were hunched infront. To my best estimate it looked like the legs/arms were about one to one and a half feet wide and the whole thing was about 3 - 4 and a half feet wide from top to bottom. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Supernatural Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described. (The drawing I made is exactly what it looked like, I am an artist and I tried my best to recreatre what it looked like to my ability, there was no extra detail necessary, like I said the drawing I made is exactly what it looked like.)

(Tl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall, white and three dimensional. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and it was shaped in a upside down V or U. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It was so white that you could see the shadow being cast on it while it was swaying like it was a real animal. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains in the shape of a upside down V or U with bulkiness/shape to the top, the two long legs/arms almost looked like if how the front view of a ape crawling on all fours would look like, as if they were hunched infront. It was moving left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and I started to feel impending doom (the sinking feeling in your chest) ""set in"" and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically ""I don't like this"", he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) in the spot where we saw the Supernatural Being. These specific beings go by ""Sisiutl"" and various other names from different Indeginous cultures. Here is the rough drawing I made of ""exactly"" what it looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O](https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O)

(Names ,links and research to the beings) ""Nightcrawler"" is just a made up name by the public/internet because they were captured on camera at night and they dubbed them ""Nightcrawlers"". Upon doing some recent research of what the First Nations person told me, many different cultures of indigenous people in B.C know about these beings and they all use a ""Double Headed Serpent"" to represent these beings. The Sto:lo First Natons states that there are 5 different kinds of ""Stl’áleqem"" (Supernatural Beings) and the ""sʔi:ɬqəý̓"" is one of them. The names of these beings and variants from different First Nations cultures in B.C are Sisiutl/laqaqua'sa, sʔi:ɬqəý̓/siilquey/si:lhqey/Seelkee/Sflhqey, Si'xqe, Shla- lah-kum, Su'ike, Ts'ewalf , Sunulqaz, énétlékē, wasgo, Say Nuth Kway , Sinulhka, Hi?, Grubworm, Larahwæse, Sisiuth, Se-sook, sulwa’us and Klu'bist.

It specifically states in a Thesis from UBC called ""The Northwest Coast Sisiutl"" from 1975 they are Supernatural beings and shamanism is strongly associated with them. Sisiutl, the Kwakiutl primary variant of the double-headed serpent, is echoed in similar beings of the Tsimshian, Tlingit, Bella Coola, Nootka and Haida groups. Sisiutl occurs in many Kwakiutl myths, but it is an established supernatural spirit with many attributes and no myth of origin. This fact supports the notion that the character sisiutl originated among the northern tribes and was adopted by the Kwakiutl. In addition, the question of visual affinity among the Northwest Coast sisiutl and sisiutl-like beings in Shang/Chou China and seventeenth-nineteenth century New Zealand is briefly addressed. ) [https://imgur.com/a/viQx9yT](https://imgur.com/a/viQx9yT) (https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0093447)

The symbol is heavily used in different cultures to represent these beings, they even have a statue at UBC in B.C dedicated to the beings. (https://imgur.com/a/UQsj1bA) (https://fnel.arts.ubc.ca/the-musqueam-s%CA%94i%C9%ACq%C9%99y%CC%93-qeq%C9%99n-double-headed-serpent-post-dedicated-at-ubc/)

""The soulcatcher (Haboolm Ksinaalgat) of the northern Tsimshian, Tlingit, and Haida peoples exhibits the same body form, and may derive its form from the sisiutl.""

This soulcatcher of ""Sisiutl"" shows the actual ""being"" secretly ornamented with abalone as the lips. If you tilt your head to the right or left you can clearly see the shiny Abalone inlay for the lips of the snake or teeth are actually the being itself hidden in plain sight.

""The word for ""sisiutl"" in Tsimshian is Laqaqua'sa, which literally means ""both sides head"".

""Among Pacific Northwest cultures, horns or plumes on artwork indicate a supernatural being."" 

""The sisiutl is a legendary creature found in many of the cultures of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. It is typically depicted as a double-headed serpent with fish qualities, sometimes with an additional central face of a supernatural being. The sisuitl features prominently in Pacific Northwest art, dances and songs. The sisuitl is closely associated with shamans because both are seen as mediators between the natural and supernatural worlds.""

""Dancers donning the mask of Sisiutl adorn themselves with western hemlock boughs, signifying wildness. Sisiutl masks were often hinged, allowing the serpent ends to simulate lifelike serpentine writhing movements. Sisiutl masks were decorated with flecks of mica, which were believed to be scales shed by Sisiutl (often found on beaches). These mica chips provided an enchanting glittery effect when danced in fire-light.""

Taken from the ""Sto:lo Heritage Policy Manual"":
“Stl’áleqem” is the word the Old People use to categorize certain spiritual beings inhabiting parts of S’ólh Téméxw.  These beings’ spiritual potency affords them a significant place in Stó:lō culture, yet they are difficult to describe or explain to people raised outside of the culture.  Metaphors of “monsters” and translations of stl’áleqem as “supernatural creatures” fall short of conveying the full meaning of the word and carry a western perspective that robs “stl’áleqem” of its Halq’eméylem essence.  Likewise, the distinction western society makes between “real” and “unreal” is not applicable in categorizing stl’áleqem: some spiritual beings, such as the hairy giant sásq’ets (sasquatch), the s’ó:lmexw (water babies) who live at the bottoms of certain lakes and deep spots in rivers, the mimestíyexw (little people) who inhabit various regions of S’ólh Téméxw and assist spirit dancers, and the majestic shxwexwó:s (thunderbird) whose flapping wings make thunder, whose blinking eyes make lightning, and whose urine is rain, are all thought to be just as real as bears, chipmunks and sturgeon, and are not considered stl’áleqem.   

Perhaps the best way of conveying what a stl’áleqem is simply to identify them by name and then describe how they are referred to within sxwôxwiyám and sqwelqwel (oral histories). The Old Ones speak of at least five different types or kinds of stl’áleqem: Sí:lhqey, the two-headed serpent; St’qoya, the frightening glowing red eyes sometimes seen at night; Ápel, the large maggot who inhabits the rock bluffs and deep bays above and in the southeast corner of Cultus Lake; and T’liteqo Spá:th, the underwater black bear who lives in the waters of the Fraser Canyon near Lady Franklin Rock.  An encounter with any one of these creatures can be dangerous, holding the potential for mixed outcomes. Stó:lō therefore regard places inhabited by stl’áleqem as xá:xa (spiritually potent; ≅ taboo).  Since many current Stó:lō activities – hunting, ritualistic spiritual swimming, and “leaving our things” – lead people to visit places where stl’áleqem reside, it is important to know their locations and to follow proper protocol. Those who have been taught how to act appropriately, such as shxwlá:m (Indian doctors), can attain spirit power by showing respect to stl’áleqem. For instance, rather than turning and running upon seeing a stl’áleqem – a typical reaction of someone not prepared for the encounter – one should face it and slowly back away until the creature is out of sight.  Another teaching specifies that a person should pluck hair from their head and blow it towards the stl’áleqem.  Failure to follow these or other appropriate, sacred teachings can lead to serious consequences.  Common reactions to mild, unintentional stl’áleqem encounters are often described as ""causing the hair to rise on the back of your neck” or producing a feeling that an unseen presence is near. Those who are warned away and yet knowingly trespass into a stl’áleqem site may suffer xó:lí:s (to twist up and die).  Children are particularly prone to this condition.  Those who do not immediately die require the treatment of a shxwlá:m to relieve their sickness""

""Once years ago I was eliciting ethnozoological information from an aged Lummi friend, Julius Charles.

They used to be around here but they've become pretty scarce and the white people have never caught one and put it in a zoo.""

""The Sea Sisuitl, a double-serpent of the Kwakuitls was one of the most powerful of the supernatural helpers. It aroused more awe than would be elicited by the representation of an ordinary snake. This creature was said in the lore of the British Columbia coast and Vancouver Island to be four feet in diameter and up to 20 feet long. At times it was in league with the mythological thunderbird. Its 'house' was either on land or in the water. The body has an identical head at each end with a human face, implying should power midway between. Almost always causing death when encountered, it was all the more dangerous because it would shrink itself to a tiny fraction of its true length. The sisuitl is holding an important symbol of wealth, the copper, which was used in potlatch ceremonies. Here, the combination of the all powerful sea-sisutl and the copper, symbol of the great wealth creates an awe-inspiring image.""

""In Native American myths and legends, horned serpents are usually very supernatural in character-- possessing magical abilities such as shape-shifting, invisibility, or hypnotic powers; bestowing powerful medicine upon humans who defeat them or help them; controlling storms and weather, and so on-- and were venerated as gods or spirit beings in some tribes. And unlike other animals such as crocodiles and snakes, horned serpents are not included in common Woodland Indian folktales about the animal kingdom. So it is likely that horned serpents have always been viewed as mythological spirits, not as animals, and that belief in them was simply very widespread in the eastern part of the country. Indeed, horned serpent mythology may trace back to ancestors of Eastern Native American tribes such as the Hopewell, Mississippian, and other mound-builder civilizations, as stylized serpent motifs have been found in their earthworks and artifacts which bear some resemblance to the horned serpents of historical Native American tribes.""

In 2018, my friends and I created, shot, and released an 8 episode webseries called Leave No Stone Unturned, where stand up comedians go ghost hunting. It was a lot of fun and 100% self-funded by the cast. It is not scripted or faked, and we had a blast doing it. Here is the link to the [season one playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFVXkNvzibsi8bgYRx2ZrTFcP_qUyYN7k)

We are based in Chillicothe, Ohio, and our investigations were focused primarily in Ohio (with one episode in Point Pleasant, WV to hunt for Mothman). If you guys check it out, pretty please let me know what you think! I just wanted to post it here since it could be up this group's alley. While we joke around quite a bit (it's the hook of the show), we also dive into the legends and history, and showcase as much of the location on camera as we can.

Episode 1: Moonville Tunnel/Cemetery near McArthur/Zaleski

Episode 2: Elizabeth's Grave, officially known as the Mount-Union Pleasant Valley Cemetery outside Chillicothe

Episode 3: Prospect Place in Trinway. We spent an entire night at the mansion and possibly caught an EVP.

Episode 4: Buzzard's Roost, Chillicothe. We went searching for an old homestead abandoned during the great depression

Episode 5: Kings Hollow Tunnel. A wooden train tunnel that is only 3 miles down the path from Moonville

Episode 6: Mothman Hunt. We explored the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant and the TNT Area where one of the first sightings was reported

Episode 7: Crosskeys Tavern in Chillicothe. A popular and very old watering hole in downtown Chillicothe

Episode 8: The Ceely Rose House at Malabar Farm, a small home where a disturbed woman poisoned her family in a misguided attempt to woo a romantic prospect

t3_ekge8t,all_ads,The Skinwalker: D’s Story,Thetruthishere,"Some background: I live in a very religious place in the south so a lot of people tend not to believe what they hear/see because it’s “just the devil playing tricks”. That being said my cousin D who is about 12 years older than me believes in this too, that what he saw was just a demon and not a skinwalker. Getting this story out of him took a while, he didn’t like to talk about it but I got him to open up about it a bit.  This happened around the mid 90’s. 

D, much like me and my cousins, spent his childhood around my mammaws property with his brother, C, and his cousin K. They would play manhunt and tag and such like we did.  When this story took place it was in the middle of the summer and he was around 12. He and C and K were playing at a treehouse that is no longer standing.

They had just pulled a prank on K and were hiding from him in the treehouse. D and C stayed in the treehouse until K stopped looking. C left and went back in to our mammaws house and left D alone. D stayed up in the treehouse and read some comics. 

The treehouse was about half a mile from the house and was on a hill so that you could still see the house from it, but it was still in the woods. At the time my Pappaw was still alive but was in Georgia on a retreat so he was not there. Which let the three boys do whatever they wanted. Pappaw would holler for them to come in when it started to get dark, because there was, and still is, a large number of coyotes and bears around the house. 

D decided to read comics all day, something be still enjoys, and eventually fell asleep. He woke up and it was dusk He heard our Mammaw yelling for him and he began to get ready to leave. As he went don the ladder he heard a coyote yip and he climbed back up. 
( At this point he began to get a little upset while telling me the story)

He began to explain what the coyote looked like and I realized it was the same one that me and my cousins had seen growing up as well. It looked like it had mange, it had a large tuft of fur missing on its right side and you could see the bare, pale skin,  and it had “human like eyes”.  It snarled at him and bore it’s teeth. He was taken aback by this and he just sat back down in the treehouse. The coyote sat at the base of the ladder and just looked up at him.

He told me he sat there for about 20 minutes trying to figure out what to do. He remembered he had a slingshot and decided that the best course of action would be to try to scare it off with that.  He said he shot at it and it just growled more. My cousin was and still is a very good shot with a slingshot I had a couple of bruises to prove it. He reared back and decided to aim at its eyes because he “didn’t like the way it stared at him”.  He reared back and got it right in its left eye it ran away yowling.

( D got a little more emotional now) He told me he climbed down the ladder and made a mad dash towards the house. About halfway to the house there is a large dip in the land where there are a bunch of bushes and small trees. When he was about there he told me that he heard coyote yips all around him and swore that a whole pack had come upon him.  He just ran from it and while he was on his way up the other side of the dip he tripped and hurt his leg.

( D started to get upset and had to stop a few times) he told me he got up and started to limp towards the house. This is the part that gave me chills, he told me that he turned and looked behind him and saw not a coyote anymore but a person. And it looked like it had his face.  He said it started to walk towards him in an “odd way” but luckily C and K started yelling for him and as quickly as it appeared it disappeared.  

D told C and K but they didn’t believe him and they told him it was just a trick of the night. Something that he still tries to believe in. As soon as he told me this he asked me kindly not to ask him about it anymore as when he thinks about it he thinks he sees that coyote outside. 

D is a very religious and reliable man. So when he says weird stuff is happening I usually believe him. The coyote he saw that night me and my cousins have seen before as well, along with a stag. Since the night me and my cousins saw it, I have had 2 more encounters l, the latest one being last year.  I will share those in time. One of my cousins who was there with me that night has a reddit and may soon tell his perception of the events. 

I have some more stories that happen more in the park than on family land that I’m going to share soon. Several of my friends have had creepy experiences as well and if they are willing I may share theirs as well. 

TL; DR: my cousin got chased by a strange coyote, and saw a humanoid with his face chase him."

t3_ek9y0s,all_ads,John,Thetruthishere,"So when I was 5 years old I was at my sister's graduation party. My family had rental out a pavilion at a heavily wooded county Park. I ended up following some kids throughout the forest and after awhile I realized I had wandered too far from the pavilion and started heading back. I remember not being able to find my way back and ended up being lost for around an hour. 

As I was walking, a man, dressed in white from head to toe, appeared to me. He told me his name was John. I explained to him I was lost and told him where my family was. I remember us walking through the woods and he had a very comforting presence about him. After awhile I remember hearing my uncle yelling my name from a distance and when I turned to tell John that that was my uncle's voice, he was gone, I turned the other way and there was my uncle. 

I'm 30 now and can't help but wonder who/what John was/is and what the meaning of all of this is."
t3_ek7vgf,all_ads,He came to say goodbye.,Thetruthishere,"When I was a sophomore in HS, my uncle was dying of lung cancer. My aunt and uncle lived with us for most of my life, so I was extremely close to them. As the diagnosis was grim, my aunt and uncle moved out because hospice recommended it as it would be even more traumatic for my sister and I as the end grew near. It was such a void not having them there, but we stayed close and visited often. 

I saw my uncle that afternoon and, unlike it’s other visits, he had so much energy! He was talking, his color looked good and I remember thinking, there’s no way he’s going to pass away soon. 

That night, I woke up from sleep in a panic. I was sweaty and my chest was beating like I had been frightened. My immediate thought was “Is Uncle Glenn OK???”. For whatever reason, if I had been dreaming, I couldn’t remember anything. I convinced myself that I was being stupid, and that I needed to calm down and go back to bed. After all, uncle looked great that day so why was I so worried? I got up to get water but as I passed the bathroom I heard my uncle calling me from outside. “Claudia! Claudia!” And I turned to see my uncle outside wiping the frost off the window to try to look in. Quickly I flipped the light switch on. For a brief second I think I was actually convinced that my uncle was outside trying to come in (dumb since he was bedridden). But there was nobody there. Was I imagining this? Am I crazy? What did I eat before bed? I went back to my room as fast as I could. Didn’t even make it to the kitchen. 

Within 2-3 minutes of laying there, the phone rang. This is the old days when we didn’t have cell phones, so I jumped out of bed to get it. It was 2-3am so nobody should have been calling. I answered at the same time as my dad did, whose bedroom was downstairs. I didn’t say hello, but I heard my aunt tell my dad that my uncle was gone. I was so heartbroken and I just stood there. I quietly hung up, but the thing was, I had this extremely overwhelming sense that I already knew. 

To this day I truly believe my uncle was saying goodbye. He was always there to help me with homework and give me advice. For many years I was closer to him than my father and I think he wanted to let me know it was going to be ok. As much as the panic I felt scared me. I felt comfort when my aunt called because I think I already just knew."

There is'nt much that happened before, and I don't know if it's just a pigment of my imagination, but here goes.

We keep our bathroom door open, and the inside is pretty dark (this is important later)

It was this person. It wasn't a shadow person. It had a mask that was like a theater mask, with both expressions (half and half), and the happy side was white with black and the sad side was black with white.

It's hoodie was black, with the hood up and with black trackpants.

It was just standing in the doorway of the bathroom, watching me.

t3_ekho9b,all_ads,Children Outside My Window,Thetruthishere,"I have a very distinct memory from a long time ago (like sometime between 1986-1989) where I looked out my window at night and saw two children and a few animals (I think I saw a rabbit and cat, maybe) circling around a tree in my side yard. The tree wasn’t that far from my bedroom window, so it was easy to see. All the figures looked a little shadowy, but not ambiguous. It looked like they were dancing, or doing ring around the rosey.

I remember watching them for a few minutes, wondering what was going on, then going to bed. 

I asked my parents about it they thought I just dreamed the whole thing, which I did not. 

We lived in a rural area, so I did not have real neighbors. There is no way there were local kids out there messing around. Plus, the kids I saw looked young. No more than 12, but likely younger.

Has anyone else had an experience like this or know what this was about?"
t3_ekg2lz,all_ads,Strange Occurrence in Forest...,Thetruthishere,"So less than a year ago, I think last Spring, me and my wife, who I’ll call R,  and our baby wanted to walk some trails through this natural park we usually go to but it was closed because it had recently rained really hard so I had an idea to go to these other trails that I had noticed the other day.

Strangely this area wasn’t very far from populated areas but if it you turn off this highway you end up on a really hilly road where one side is apartments and the other side is the tall trees of this area we were going to walk through.

So we park and we have a stroller and immediately there is two possible paths to choose , ones leads up and is more smooth and the other is rocky and led down. We chose to go down even though is was rocky and we had a stroller because we saw some people on the other and this one seemed like no one was on it and it would lead through fender trees.

We go down this incline for a bit then cross a small wooden bridge across a creek. I remember immediately I said “hey do you smell that ? It smells like sugar cookies or baking” but she didn’t smell it. The trails starts leading uphill and I remember we stopped at a place where behind us you can see the land stretching up with many trees on it so far away, it was weird because I had never been here and didn’t realize it was densely wooded here and it was so quiet.  There were many fresh smells and everything has moss on it, orange, green and yellow, I guess because of the rain, but it felt peaceful. 

We were talking and R said “hey do you hear that?” I didn’t but she said it sounded like a patting sound, I thought maybe it could be a rabbit when we paused and looked around we didn’t see or hear anything. Now I’m more acquainted with nature and woods and what not but she wasn’t, I figured she was just overly worried about predator animals or whatever, but she was ok to keep going because it didn’t sound too major. Up to this point I was just enjoying the rich smell of the wet forest, I hadn’t smelt anything strange except for the sweet sugar cookie type smell like baking previously.

We continued walking and R said she heard something so we would stop and look around but it was be completely silent except for the trees rustling In the breeze. Light shone through the top of the trail between the gap in the trees but in the side it was quite shady due to the leaves and foliage. This happened a couple of times and I assumed she was just getting spooked for no reason. Then all of sudden she was like “Ewww do you smell that?! It smells like something dead or rotting”. At this point i started sniffing and the first sniff I thought I smelled cologne or perfume, but what is strange is that I would breathe and then take a deep whiff over and over again but each time I did I was smelling some new smell like I was cycling through many various scents from perfume to just kind of musty to nothing and then something new. 

That was weird but it still didn’t think anything was going on, I honestly just thought it was very peaceful how quiet it was, aside from the slight rustling of trees, and there was moss on everything so multicolored. I had actually not seen so much moss before. 

As we got further along , maybe because it was so quiet, I really don’t know, I kind of chuckled and said yeah I am kind of getting a creepy vibe here . And I really was, I can’t explain it but it simply felt a little surreal or something. And about 5 or six times up to this point she said had heard something and we would stop and look around and hear nothing but the trees. And to be honest you couldn’t see that well because of fallen trees and branches and little foliage. She had also been saying she felt like something was watching us.

Well we got up a ways and there was a part of the trail that was slightly brighter and just a little more open, but still trees and plant life to the side. And at this area the trail turned right and began going up hill again, just previously it was flat.  At this point R said “did you feel that?” And apparently she felt the ground shake silently.  Well I looked around and this time I actually did see something. I saw the top of a thin tree shake and looked down. It was far off but to my eyes looked like something low and brown kind waddling at a jogging speed  about 50 yards out or so, it wasn’t too close so I wasn’t that worried. I kept staring and I got closer to edge of the trees to try and see it. As I’m looking I was like “Ohhh wow, it just a guy riding a horse over there.”

I assumed there was another trail over there because it looked like a guy riding a horse with the horse having brown legs and the man must of been wearing black because it looked like black over brown. I’m squinting to see and then I realize whatever it was bent a thin tree to the side to step around it in way that someone riding a horse could not possibly do. I realized that it looked something tall and slightly hunched and it appeared to be kind of stalking around us.

 I Honestly freaked the fuck out haha.. I took the baby out of the stroller and gave her to R and we ran back with me hanging in the back and facing backwards I was dragging the stroller behind while I faced that way to watch our backs. We basically ran all the back to the front of the trail near where we began but still kind of in the forest.


We were catching our breath and we were really excited just kind of saying what the fuck was that, she didn’t see it but I did and I was telling her what I saw. We were freaked out and just excitedly talking about what we saw when we saw something else on the trail.

Now this is where it gets even weirder.. he was coming from the way that we came when we originally arrived, the beginning of the trail. He was a bearded white guy with a backpack and no shirt and little short shorts on. I think said something from a distance like “got a little lost back there” and he was smiling big. 

This was in the middle of us talking excitedly and I was started like laughing and was like “WowW! That was you?! We were freaking scared man!” He didn’t explicitly say yeah that was me but he was like yeah I like to try and explore everything. It so beautiful out here isn’t it? I’m going see if if there’s anything I missed and he ended up going the trail the way we just ran from. It wasn’t until he left that we were like Wait... how’d he get all the way back here behind us if that was him in the trees? And how come hes not all scratched up from running through the foliage and trees with his skin exposed? The area is too dense with plants and trees to not be scratched, especially if your running which he must have had to do in order to get all the around us. Although he didn’t explicitly say yeah that was me, it did seem that he acknowledged us that it was indeed him that we saw. He seemed really friendly and was smiling the whole time, but I cant tell if maybe we didn’t see him at all and perhaps he wasn’t saying that we did or what but we left immediately after that.

I wonder what you guys think about this..."
t3_ejyo5t,all_ads,The skinwalker,Thetruthishere,"I live near a very large, very popular National Park. Locals here, like myself, are pretty aware of the goings on near here: strange sounds, strange creatures, and strange disappearances. I have dealt with these myself in the past on hikes and even just relaxing in the park. Here is one that still freaks me out to this day.

I was at my grandmas house that’s deep in the boonies, the only road to there is a gravel road that is pretty much washed away so without a good car you’re not getting out there anyways. My cousins lived in a trailer with their moms right bellow my grandmas. We played all sorts of games which mainly involved me getting chased, I was the youngest.

My grandma was in the hospital with my aunt so our older cousin (who I’ll name D) had to watch us. D was, and still is, the only cousin that’s older than us that we still hold in high regards, he would mess with us and play around but actually cared about us. The whole day we spent playing around but we would usually play more at night: like hide and seek, tag, etc. 

We had been playing pretty far away from the house and it was starting to get dark. We decided to go back to the house and grab flashlights and play manhunt. Of course I was the one being hunted. I ran pretty far into the woods on the other side of the property and hid behind a log. I heard my cousins getting close so I ran and they saw me. 

We ended up running to the very back of the property line (almost a mile from the house) and we saw my cousin D. He looked at us and kinda growled and we all ran from him, thinking it was a game. We ran back onto the gravel road and we saw him walk out of the tree line but he did weird, kinda gloatingly in a way. We ran into the house and decided to barricade the door to play a prank on him. 

We moved a couple of things in front of the door but decided to move the big coffee table in front of it too. As we loudly scooted the table across the floor, D came into the living room from the master bedroom running his eyes. We had obviously woke him up from all the movement and he was mad. We told him about seeing him chase us and he got wide eyed. He told us to go to our bedroom and stay there. 

We sat in the bedroom for about 20 minutes and he came in and told us not to worry. That it was just him scaring us and we went on with the night. It wasn’t until about 3 years later, when I was 13. That he told me the truth, it was a skin walker. He told me that he has dealt with it when he was our age and told me his story.  Which I may share as well someday depending on how far this goes. This is of course just one story. There’s loads more. 

TL; DR:  we saw my cousin in the woods chasing us even though he was home asleep"
t3_ekifgq,all_ads,Little Tales,Thetruthishere,"These are both short so I'm putting them in one post.  I was seven, I had four cousins over plus my little sister.  We were hanging out in the basement, watching a movie.  All of a sudden we heard my mom freaking out and yelling at us for running around.  When we came upstairs to explain we weren't, she turned pale as hell and said she'd heard kids running around the second floor hallway and giggling like crazy just a minute before.  She checked but no one was upstairs.

When I was six, my family was watching Jeopardy and kept hearing a weird thumping noise coming from the kitchen (kitchen was on the other side of the wall behind the sofa).  Just every two-there minutes, a loud thump, like a thick book hitting the tile floor, but when we would check, nothing was there.  Eventually, my brother Nick and I just stayed in the kitchen to see if we could spot what was causing the noise.  Three minutes later, a huge dusty and kinda see through tome fell through the kitchen ceiling, hit the floor with a thump, and then just kinda melted into nothing.  This only happened the one evening, was never repeated.  Very weird.  Brother and I just staring at each other like ""You saw that, right?"".  With all the weird stuff always happening around my family, my parents just kinda took it in stride and were like ""eh, whatever, it wasn't hurting anyone"".  So weird."
t3_ek6xef,all_ads,The town in the woods,Thetruthishere,"A lot of you wanted my cousins story on the skinwalker but I’m going to try to get the actual story from him tomorrow and I’ll fill you in there. I do have another one that I’d like to share however. This one doesn’t have anything to do with skinwalkers, at least I don’t think.

There was an old legend about a “lost town” in the forest near where I lived and for the most part all it was, was a legend. However, it was noted as being true and a ghost town is near my town. The story that I’m about to tell happened when I was 11 and still irks me to this day.

My dad like to take me on little off-road rides in his Jeep, it wasn’t necessarily an off road One either it was a Cherokee so it wasn’t really built for backwoods dirt trails. He decided to do this one that was out in the park with me and told me you’d be fun and we would go check out ruins of an old building and then we decided to go we were about a good hour into the park. 

There was one of those “official vehicle only” gates on this dirt road and usually that would stop people but my dad just decided to break the lock and push it open anyways. My Father was ever the best at listening to rules. About 30 minutes into our drive on this road he’s shining a flashlight out the windows trying to find this building and has his headlights on full and we’re just both looking for any signs of anything. Eventually we come upon this really steep hill. 

He says “Oh I think I remember this” and just guns it up the hill. Naturally, we get stuck at a certain angle where we can’t reverse or accelerate. My dad never likes to admit he’s wrong and said he can fix it and started tinkering with it. I was very curious and still am so I got the flashlight and I started looking in the woods around us really kind of just worried for bears or wolves. 

I noticed a little light in the valley below us and turn off the flashlight to see it. While my dad was cursing at our car I decided to get a little closer to the light and see if I can figure out what it was mainly to see if it was somebody who could help us. As I got closer to it the trees took it apart a little and it was a very small town, the best way I can describe it is like that town from the movie Big Fish. Just a very numbered set of small buildings.

As I got closer I heard voices and saw people. But something just seemed weird about it like they weren’t really there. I decided to try to get closer to the town but the more Closer I got the more weirded out I got. I eventually felt like if I didn’t turn around I would never come back which is a very odd feeling to have and decide to just go back up to my dad. He didn’t get the car unstuck, by himself at least and we just slept in the car. the next morning a park ranger showed up and after a very lengthy talk with my dad and a very hefty ticket he helped us get the car unstuck and we were on our way. 

Before we left I tried to catch another glimpse at the village and it was the ruins my dad was talking about. I talked to the park ranger about it and all he said was it was once a “thriving” village that was just lost in time. I decided not to say anything about what I saw to the Ranger and did tell my dad but his usual skepticism turn me away from bringing it up anymore. 

I have since visited that same village and it’s a really pretty place I told my friend about what I saw and I believed me for the most part and we decided to stay one night around the woods and try to see if anything happened and of course nothing did. But I still remember that night as if it was yesterday and still get goosebumps from the feeling I had visiting it. 

TL; DR: saw a town very lively and full of people, just to see it long abandoned the next day"
t3_ekg8nh,all_ads,Technology hates me.,Thetruthishere,"I'm a long time lurker but I feel that I need to get this off my chest I hope it doesn't sound too weird and I'm open to the possibly that it may just be coincidence or that there is a logical/non spooky reasonings behind it

Basically technology hates me i don't know how to explain it but the earliest things I remember is that whenever someone used to turn on a tv (the big backed ones every one had in the 90-00) I could hear a screeching sound when it was being turned on and could even hear the sound rooms away and even hear it in the upstairs neighbours house. As I got older things like my PlayStation and DS would crash randomly and the wires would break frequently and then when I moved onto phones too would crash but they always seem to run out of battery really fast regardless of what I was doing, my Ex gave me his old phone and it was fully charged and reset yet the battery runs out much faster with me. I also seem to feel the current through any phone I have when it is charging, I've tried different chargers, cases and plug sockets but I still feel it as does anyone one else who touches me when I'm holding the charging phone.

Now here is the bit that really worries me, it seems whenever I'm stressed out a lot things around my house seem to struggle. I've recently split up with my Ex (we are still friends) and I'm moving into my own house in a week which means I'm stressed out and it seems like my house is too, things like the lights starting to flicker randomly in whichever room I'm in so we replaced some of switched and the bulbs which also have started to pop when I'm in the rooms, the shower struggling to keep pressure and keeps making noises so we had to have a new shower and shower switch, my phone is crashing at least 10 times a day, the clock I used for the oven (it's electric) keeps bleeping or not bleeping when needed, my rice cooker broke, etc.

I don't know what's going on but it's not the first time this had happened in this house and has even happened in all my other houses. Has someone got any explanation for why this is happening or has anyone else experience anything else like this?"

t3_ek8lwp,all_ads,Forgotten Event,Thetruthishere,"This happened a while back.

By the way, I’m 15 now.

A couple years ago, roughly in 2012-ish, y’know around that time, my family was living in a farm house. Now, the house itself was close to the road, so most of the property was further back behind the house. Anyways, I remember the day clearly, it was cloudy, and only a little late in the afternoon (I had just gotten home from school, so roughly 3-ish). Also, at the time I was around 7-8 years old. It was a cloudy day, with a gray blanket covering the sky. Then, suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck in the middle of our driveway. Nothing was hit fortunately, but it was strange since there was no thunder or rain prior. Just suddenly out of nowhere. The clouds weren’t thick either, it was only a thin layer. I still have no clue what happened to this day.

And just so you know, I can remember this event clear as day. I *KNOW* what I saw and heard is real.

If anybody knows what happened, please tell me. It’s been bothering me ever since that day.

Also, the weirdest part is that I’m the only one who *saw* the lightning bolt. And it was slightly blue. However my entire family heard the sound of the lightning, but didn’t see it.

Also I don’t know if I chose the right tag for this."
t3_ek20y8,all_ads,My stories,Thetruthishere,A lot of you seem to enjoy my skin walker story that I had today. I’m really glad that I found a placeWhere I can share my accounts with these things and not just be laughed out. I have several stories from years of living in the middle of the woods and even some that happened out of state that I’ve still dealt with. If you’d like to hear some of those just let me know because I’d love to tell them.  I’ve always kind of been drawn to the supernatural and it seems to be drawn to me so I’d love to hear your account as well. :)
t3_ek8qph,all_ads,This House,Thetruthishere,"I previously posted a situation that had happened to me in my home on this site. There are several things that have happened to me that I've always wondered why?? If anyone could help me decipher any reasoning behind my experience, do tell!! I'd REALLY appreciate it.

This has been happening to me  since the day I decided to write my experiences. I thought, if anything, my words saved on a Word document could be read by some brave family member, letting them know what I had gone through when I'm no longer here. 

I try to write my experiences as often as things happen to me; it could be EVERY night!! God knows that what I say is 100% true!!  

One evening something had happened to me in the home and I wanted to write it down.  I grabbed my laptop and  I started to write. Like always, in between me writing someone banged on the kitchen wall so hard that the trash lid shut closed, I turned towards the kitchen and no one was there obviously; my family had gone out to a baseball fundraiser and I was too tired to go so I was alone. Minutes later, in the hallway something sounded like a body or large mass was pressed against the wall and walking, making a rubbing sound against the wall?? Then the light that was left on in the den started to flicker, I heard footsteps in the kitchen and the corners of the house began to crack simultaneously. This happens EVERY TIME I write. 

Has anyone had this happen to them or an idea what this could be? I recently stopped writing but my neighbor introduced me this site and I'm hoping SOMEONE can give me feedback, please."
t3_ek7mhy,all_ads,Just odd timing,Thetruthishere,"First post here, not sure if it fits in but I have a weird history of being perfectly timed tapping or humming or something to music that someone else is listening to which I cannot hear over a call on discord or elsewhere. Not exactly paranormal but i think it's interesting nontheless."
t3_ejtnpv,all_ads,It's here but not to stay,Thetruthishere,"I've never posted my experiences and they might not seem frightening to you (I hope it at least sparks up some questions) but when you're right in front of something you can't explain, it would make anyone run for the hills like a bat outta hell; I just never ran because I'd become so numb from the fear.

I lived in a BEAUTIFUL home, which I still own, we'll say, in Valencia, CA for anonymity reasons. It was a big home on a huge lot. My home isn't too old, it was built in 1940. I lived there with my husband, 3 sons ages, 8, 11 and 13 and their dog. 

I had a treadmill that was nicely folded in the corner of the den facing the wall and every time I passed by the den to go the laundry room, I'd look at it and say to myself - I gotta make time. I was always on the go and I never had time for me; If you're a parent or you come from a family always involved in sports with their kids, you know what I mean. Then one day I said, Forget that I'm going to do our daily pickups at the park for the kids, cook dinner, do homeworks, put a load to wash, feed these guys and even if it's 10pm, I'm gonna get on that sucku, TO-NIGHT!!! 

And that's exactly what I did!! I took care of everyone and then I took out that pin on the side of the treadmill and turned it on; I wasn't too happy that the treadmill was facing the wall but if I had my husband turn it around, it may take too long and I wasn't gonna do that. So, BEFORE I got on that treadmill I ran to each one of my kids including my husband and I told them that for the next 20 minutes, NO ONE was to call me for NOTHING! They all understood and I ran to start my workout. I put on my headphones, turned on my music and began feeling the music flow and I begin to walk. I was feeling good and so proud of myself and I turned up the volume to COMPLETELY drown out ALL the happenings, if any, in my home. I listened to one song, then the next song came on and it was Beyoncé, Love On Top, my favorite!! I was pumped up and feeling GREAT!! Then out of nowhere, I stared to hear a chorus of screams coming out of the song that I was listening to. I thought It must be an interference, so I paused the song for a bit then started to play it again. About a minute later these vicious and angry screams, all in different pitches and tones pierced my ears. I looked back, still walking on my treadmill because I thought - My kids are fighting and If I get off this machine, they're gonna get it! I continued but the same yelling persisted so I paused the treadmill and the music, got off and walked to my kids room ready to tell them all off but when I got to the first room, my younger kids, surprisingly, were playing with their GI Joes?? I said - Who in the hell is fighting here? They looked at me like I was a mad woman and they responded that it wasn't them. I stared at them  for a bit, not believing them because I KNOW I heard some yelling, like someone was angry and fighting? So I stood by the door for a few seconds looking at them while they ignored me and I turned around, closed the door and walked back to the treadmill. I get back on the treadmill, start the damn thing up again, turn on the music, this time it was a totally different song, and after a few minutes, cries and yelling began up again!! I thought, if it wasn't the kids and it can't be my phone then what the heck?? I continued walking, ignoring the screams but it just got louder and more violent. I kept walking and I began to really listen to the screams and cries of what sounded like so many people angry and whaling at the same time. I began to feel something behind me, getting closer; now you KNOW something's up when your heart starts to beat faster all on its own, the air gets thicker, I can't explain this sensation but your body is telling you, it feels something that's just not right. This only happened AFTER I was really listening to the screams in the background, trying to see what the heck it could be?? The energy began to feel heavy and very electrically charged. I felt this energy on my back, like it was standing RIGHT behind me. I didn't know what the hell to do because my husband was in the room watching TV and my kids were in their rooms so there was NO ONE to call out to nearby. I KNEW something was there, but I continued to walk, still listening to the screaming, piercing cries in my ears like If I wasn't experiencing a damn thing. Finally when I couldn't handle the growing feeling that something horribly wrong was about to happen, I calmly, and I did this because I KNEW if I freaked out, whatever was on me would prey on my fear and I would encounter something that I wouldn't be able to shake. So I calmly, paused the treadmill, grabbed my phone, I never paused the music because I was too scared to listen to the complete silence in the room, I turned around, ready to step off the treadmill and I can now feel the heaviness of the air, stagnant, right on my face, inches away from what felt like my soul because I felt my insides quiver, like when you're so cold, but you're not cold and youre bod's shaking from the inside out. I step off the treadmill, walked to open the French doors that led into the now dark living room and whatever I felt was now hovering over me. I still have the music going on and the screams are still as violent as before, I start going into the hallway towards my room and by that time I can't take it anymore, my brain's flipping out and I start to chant the only words I could think of spoken to me by a good friend - The Blood of Jesus protects me, The Blood of Jesus protects me!! By the 3rd time I said these words I felt this strong gravity pull me from the top of my head, I almost felt like I was going to be elevated because it was such a strong pull but whatever was following me tore itself from me, that's how it felt, like it tore itself from my energy, and my body stopped shaking uncontrollably. 

A few feet away from where this thing, because it was neither a male or female, dislodged itself from me, was the door to my bedroom. I walked in and I didn't tell my husband what had happened because he didn't believe in any of this stuff so I just changed into my PJ's, watched TV in bed until I fell asleep."
t3_ejxdg9,all_ads,Some unexplained experiences taking place in our home in the UK,Thetruthishere,"I’d like to share with you some unexplained experiences that have been, and are still taking place in our rented property in England, UK.

A bit of background first, the house is a small, one bedroomed pre-WWI terrace house, originally built to house steel workers around the time of the Industrial Revolution. 

So yes, the house is old, very cold, and has an unfurnished basement (which floods when the water table rises) and a very leaky attic. Neither of which we use. Myself and my wife have lived here for the last five years with our small dog and there have been some very strange goings on.

In the years we’ve lived here we’ve been subject to some very strange experiences which we haven’t been able to explain, and here are a few below, starting with the earliest.

1. About a year after we’d moved in, my wife, myself and the dog were sat in the living room around half past midnight one evening. I was watching TV, the dog was asleep next to me, and the wife was watching something on her tablet at the other side of me. 

Our kitchen and living room are linked by a solid folding door, which was closed. From the kitchen, I heard one of the dogs toys begin to squeak, as if someone had stepped on it, and then taken their foot off it. Obviously this was quite alarming, as I assumed there was no one else  in the house. Startled, I jumped up (as did the dog) and approached the door to see what was happening, as I approached the folding door, it moved slightly as if someone had pushed on it from the other side. I jumped back, let out a yell, before shouting to ask anyone that was there to leave (I initially assumed someone had entered the kitchen through the back door).

Terrified, I went into the kitchen to find it in darkness, the back door locked, and the dog’s toys piled up in the corner as they normally are. Still scared, but adrenaline rushing through me, I quickly ran upstairs to see if anyone had somehow gained entrance to the house through the attic or a window. No one had, thankfully. Nevertheless, this meant I could not easily explain what had just happened.

2. The second event happened about six to eight months later. My wife and I were in bed, again with the dog at the side of us, when we heard what sounded like a large crash coming from downstairs. 

In the intervening period between the first event and this one we had been broken into, so obviously as you could expect I was wary of immediately running downstairs in case it was another intruder. 

Eventually, I managed to bring myself to work my way downstairs. The house was in darkness, nothing was out of place in the kitchen, however when I went into the living room, the sofa cushions, and TV remotes were scattered across the floor. 

All the doors and windows were locked, and there again was no obvious sign of who or what had caused this.

3. The third major event took place around 3am. All of us were asleep in the bedroom, when I was awoken by the sound of footsteps walking across the landing and downstairs. Startled again, but not really thinking, I jumped up, woke up the wife, turned the bedroom and landing lights on, ran into the landing itself and downstairs very quickly. The house again in darkness, and all doors and windows locked. No one around. The dog had followed me this time and was growling quite a bit. Again, I couldn’t explain what I just experienced. 

There have been some other smaller events that have taken place since, and are still taking place. We’ve had crashing noises from the kitchen when we’ve been in the living room, footsteps in the bedroom when we’ve been downstairs, and laughing and giggling noises from various areas in the house. 

Recently, in a new development, we’ve also found items that have been missing from their normal places sometimes days later without explanation, and returned home to find lights have been turned on and things moved around. 

The dog often stares into corners of the kitchen, bedroom, and at the top of the stairs for a few minutes without explanation.

Myself and my wife are both rational people, so we have looked at obvious explanations for the events above (it sounds like we’ve got another person(s) living in our house!) but we have not yet been able to successfully explain them. 

We have CCTV installed in the kitchen (we’ve checked it at various specific times during some of the events above, and seen nothing) and have asked our neighbours if they’ve seen anything unusual taking place when we are asleep, or not in, to which they haven’t. 

I wouldn’t necessarily say I believe in poltergeists or ghosts, but I am a firm believer that there are often events and things we cannot explain using modern science and Occam’s Razor.

I’m interested to see what you guys think, and thank you for allowing me to share these experiences with you!"

Went to stay with my BF and his kids in the house he had just rented. My kids and I slept in the family room. 

During the night I woke up because I felt someone’s face close to mine. I didn’t open my eyes. At first I thought one of my kids had woken up and was trying to see if I was awake. Still without opening my eyes I said, “I’m awake, are you ok?” Nothing. But I still felt someone in my face. Then I opened my eyes and it was so dark but I saw someone. It was so close I couldn’t really make it out and then it was gone. 

My kids were sound asleep. 

Fast forward a couple months and we all moved in together. This was a big house. Five bedrooms. While moving my things in I noticed a bunch of large plastic bins in our bedroom closet. BF said that it seemed the owner had moved out abruptly and left a lot of his personal items and even some furniture. The realtor asked that we not bother anything and that the owner had planned on eventually removing his things. 

However I needed the closet space and being curious I went through some of the bins. They were clothing and shoes mostly. But there were also diaries. I put everything back and didn’t snoop. At least not right away.

It was shortly after this that I started having sleep paralysis. Some nights I’d wake up feeling terrified and not knowing why. I also kept getting that feeling of someone being right in my face. 

One of the kids started having nightmares and saying someone was in his closet. 

Then BF’s daughter came home from school with quite the story. Seems the owners wife had committed suicide in the house. That’s why so much of their things were left behind. 

Now my curiosity was really going and I found their wedding video. She was absolutely gorgeous. I’m going to leave out some details on the off chance someone who’s familiar with the family reads this. 

Once I found the video and watched I could feel her and I don’t think I ever slept well in that house after. I wasn’t afraid just incredibly sad. So I decided to read her diaries. 

They were having marriage troubles. She wanted to divorce him but he was threatening her. He was planning to take away the kids. He said he’d plant drugs on her and get her put away. He wanted her to have cosmetic surgery and get liposuction. He sounded like a monster. The profession he was in was one of power and authority. 

After I read her diaries things calmed down a bit. I stopped feeling her around as much. Almost as if she just wanted someone to understand what she had gone through. 

The last big thing to happen before we moved was I was alone during the day, just the dog and I. The dog was down in the family room and I was upstairs sitting at the desk. I heard the dog scramble to get himself up the stairs which I could see from where I sat. He was a large dog and he ran and squeezed himself under the desk by my legs. He was shaking and heavy panting. I turned back to look at the stairs when I saw the tall dark figure of what looked like a man in a black trench coat and hat. Went slowly right up the stairs and through the front door. 

We moved out a few months later but had no other incidents after that. 

I hope that indicates she was finally at peace."
t3_ejuesf,all_ads,Strange voices and dial tones in my work parking lot,Thetruthishere,"Okay, so every day when I drive to work, I like to give myself 5-10 minutes to just chill in my car in the parking lot before walking in since it’s a 45 min. drive to work. Nearly every single day, as I’m sitting silently in my car, I’ll hear strange disembodied voices that sound either like two people having a conversation, or one person talking on the phone. I usually can’t make out any words. Also, I occasionally hear the sound a phone makes when you’re calling someone. The ringing sound. It’s so weird to me, because when I open my car door to try to find out where it’s coming from, I can’t hear anything at all. But when I close my door again, after a few seconds, it comes back loud and clear. I’m wondering if maybe there’s some kind of echo or weird sound thing going on? Also, today I was in the car with my whole family and as we were leaving the parking lot, we heard that phone ringing sound and couldn’t find the source. If anyone has any ideas, I’d be glad to hear them."
t3_ejyxpx,all_ads,"Weird coincidence, timing or something else",Thetruthishere,"Honestly not a premonition but I seem to have great timing with things regardless.

I interviewed for a job a few weeks ago. I heard nothing for about a week and waited patently. I was at work and a co worker asked along the lines of “Hey have you heard anything yet?” I said no and walked away to go get something and didn’t take long to come back. I came back and she said “Manager called he wants to talk to you.”

This was the manager that interviewed me. I’m like “that’s weird because we just talked about my interview.” Well in the end I now have a new job and many questions.

If it’s a coincidence it’s a really weird one or just great timing. I did pray to a few saints for help getting this job. One being Saint Joseph and I’m not the biggest believer among Christians. Prayer has worked to help me have self confidence before and the will to keep going. I also remember asking the universe for help with this job also. 

I haven’t had a lot of happenings like this before but this one sticks out."
t3_ejisvk,all_ads,Weird stuff is happening in my house that I cannot explain.,Thetruthishere,"Hello everyone! Forgive me in advance as I know nothing about ghosts, premonitions or anything of the sort. I’m not someone who would deny their existence but I certainly haven't given much thought to the validity behind it. I have no experience on r/Thetruthishere (just found it recently) and my goal is to hear opinions of others. I’ll try and dish out as much info as possible. This is long winded but I need to get the whole story out and if you make it to the end, I appreciate you. I don't know if this sub gets a lot of people bullshitting, but I'm not.

**Background info:**

In 2016 I moved into a new house that was built in the 60’s but is completely gutted and redone. It’s about 3200 square feet, the garage was converted into bedroom and it’s a “quad”, i.e. 4 floors with small staircases that lead to each floor and sits on about an acre of property. The house has a security system, it’s pad-locked at every entrance and we have a 90 pound pit bull who will run to the door or windows at the slightest sound. I had my first and only kid in 2017 and the events started happening after he was born. Both my wife and I have had the experiences but they have never once happened when we’re together, only alone. She is not a “ghosts are real” person *at all*.

**The noises:**

Around the time my son was born my wife and I started spending more time apart because if one person went out to be with friends or traveled for business, the other was at home watching the kid. All sorts of LOUD noises started happening around the house when I was by myself. The first I can recall was when I was laying in bed upstairs after putting the kid down. A crashing sounds came from the kitchen that sounded *exactly* like pots and pans falling and breaking so I went down there but none of them had fallen or broke. I brushed it off but Anubis (the dog - aka Newby or Newbs) didn’t run down with me and that was out of character for him. The cat was in my room as well so she didn't cause it. There was literally no explanation so I went back to bed and said “fuck it”.

Then this kept happening. At least 10 more times I heard unexplainable noises. Some were louder, some not as much, most were thumps or bangs but never pots and pans again. I’m 6’ 5’’ and 230 pounds with a big dog – not the kind of guy who worries about someone breaking in but there were two instances that freaked me the fuck out. The first happened when I was laying in bed. Underneath my room (used to be a garage) is where I keep my drums and that room had a loud banging noise that lasted for at least 5 seconds. The best explanation of what it sounded like was someone taking a baseball bat and hitting a plastic trash can as hard as possible. It wasn’t the drum set because I have an *electric* set in that room and neither the set or the speakers were on. To add to that, Newby did nothing – not a thing. He gave me a weird look and went back to watching TV with me. Again, really out of character. I had no explanation but I can tell you I was  freaked out.

The loudest sound came a few weeks later when I was (again) in my bedroom. There were two back-to-back THUMP sounds coming from my office which shares a wall with my bedroom. No exaggeration, it sounded like a guy my size pounded the wall with his fist twice as hard as possible – like hard enough to break the drywall. I look at the dog and he gives me this “fuckkkk that” face and pushes his face into the comforter. I’m shaking with this weird feeling I cannot explain and the main reason is again, the dog should be in that fucking room before and not laying his head down.

I’ll say this: I’m an avid believer in E.T. life. I’ve seen a UFO, I’ve done my research and I don’t question it. My wife takes a neutral perspective on it but saying “I believe in aliens” already pushes the “you’re weird” limit in our social circle so I’ve never brought up or talked about spirits beyond death with her (ghosts?). However, after that night I had to say something to her and it turns out she’s been having the same experiences with the same sounds but like me, only when she’s alone. We both agreed it’s probably the house or whatever so we laughed it off and haven’t discussed it again to this day.

Here’s the thing: it’s not the house and nobody can convince me otherwise. The sounds are too loud to be HVAC or plumbing related (I am familiar with the setup), some are too specific (i.e. pots and pans) to be anything other than what they sound like and after 20+ combined experiences, they only happen when we’re alone. Because the bumps and bangs are so different in noise created, I cannot identify one specific thing that could offer a rational explanation.

**Here's when it got a** ***little*** **weird:**

My drum set had the majority of the room facing my back and I faced a corner in the room with no visibility behind me – this room used to be a garage and was converted. A few months ago I started getting this weird feeling when playing. It could all be in my head but I’d be sitting there playing for an hour and all of the sudden it felt like someone was standing behind me, staring at me. It would happen suddenly, enough so that there was a time I took my headphones off (I listen to the drums through them) and yelled out loud like I had just scared me by jumping out from behind the door. Some of these experiences happened when my wife was home because I ran up to her and was so nervous I spent the night “next to her”, meaning I watched TV when she did, went to bed when she did, etc. This could all be in my head but it was such a vivid feeling that I took the whole set apart and rebuilt it to face the room – a cumbersome task I did not want to do at all. It allowed me to have my back in a corner of the room with nothing behind me.

**Here's when it got** ***a lot*** **weird:**

My wife is gone and I’m putting the kid to bed. Normally I close the door so no light comes in but I had that same weird feeling of someone being there, so much so that I kept the door open and turned the light on in his bathroom so I could see the hallway – first time I ever did that. The dog was next to me. The cat was not. As I’m rocking my kid a black, shadowy figure that stood as tall as me walked across the doorway and into the bathroom. There were no facial features but clearly 2 arms, 2 legs, in a walking stance and a human shaped figure. I have no additional explanation on what it looked like because it was quick and that is all the info I can provide. Again, Newby's ""I'm supposed to be tough"" ass didn't move, just stared. I sat there and analyzed the entire room and there was no explanation. Because the cat was not in the room, I decided that the most reasonable (although ridiculous) explanation was the cat walked in my kid's bathroom (which she doesn’t, it's a splash zone of water) and created some sort of weird shadow while kind of jump-walking on her feet to make a human like figure to explain why there were arms. The only issue with that is a horizontal shadow like that could only be created if the cat walked between the wall and a light facing it, which she did not. The only light was coming from the ceiling in the kid's bathroom.

I watched the entrance to that bathroom for another 5 minutes without breaking eye-contact of the bottom of the entryway to see if that cat walked out, even as I laid my kid in his bed I didn’t divert my eyes. I decided that if I walk in that bathroom and she wasn't there, some crazy shit was going on. The kid goes down, I walk in the bathroom and the cat’s not there. I look to find her and she’s in the basement laying on the couch where she spends the majority of her day. If she walked out, I would have seen *and* heard her as she does make a sound going down stairs, especially when things are completely quiet as the kid is falling asleep.

A few weeks ago I was alone for a few hours and got that same feeling. I went into my kitchen and said out loud something along the lines of “*This is your house, I’m just a guest as buying the house doesn’t mean I “own it” except in my world. I have no issues with you being here and I’m not looking to create issues, I’m only looking for peace and understanding” –* something like that anyway. I haven’t had any issues since but I haven’t been alone enough to test if that “worked”.

Anyway, if you’ve made it to this paragraph I thank you for your time and hopefully your opinion. If you think I’m making this all up for a good story, that’s fine, I hope you liked it but move along. I’m not looking to have a séance or have a priest walk through my house burning some incense. All I’m looking for is information from people more educated on this subject than me or from those who have gone through similar circumstances.

Again, I appreciate your time reading this. It means a lot to me.

t3_ek1sz6,all_ads,Heard weird noises while walking in the woods with friend,Thetruthishere,"**This story isn't as scary as the other ones on here but it scared the hell out of me and my friend. I'm sorry for my potential crappy writing as this is my first post.**

This happened just a couple hours ago when me and my friend was walking through this path near my uncles home. This path isn't in the middle of nowhere and it's actually next to the middle of town but separated by a river  and some woods. So my friend he doesn't live in the same town so when he comes over i try to show him around and walk around town. Today i wanted to explore some paths off of the main trail and i always remember this gravel path branching off the regular asphalt path. We start walking down it and there's already instant creep feels you know the usual dangling trees and it's just still cold out so the trees all looked dead.

The path lead to a gated fence that led to i think a water treatment plant or some sort of construction yard where they would get dirt and gravel from, so we turn around and start walking back to the main trail. I see a path where it branches off and it looked mainly used but not like dirt-bike trails sense the branches where hanging too low. I probably should've took some pictures but i wasn't thinking about it.

So after climbing under a couple trees that fell over we make it to where the path sorta bends and i can't see anything other then woods. Me and my friend was talking and walking then we heard, like a **ice-cream truck song**. It sounded close like only a 100 ft away, not crazy close but a medium amount of distance.

**The song was almost exactly like this but i thought it sounded a little different but it might be the same that i heard its hard to recall.**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w09zIROwIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w09zIROwIE) or  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLUSTle-U4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLUSTle-U4o)

So after we heard that i looked back at my friend and we started fast walking the fuck outta there. We did the Karen walk at the grocery store when the essential oils are on sale. When we finally make it back to the gravel path (not back to the main one but the one that branched off) and we just looked at each other and said

Me ""Hey (Friends name) what the fuck was that?""

Friend ""I don't fucking know but lets just dip""

We started walking back to the main trail when we heard a really loud like whistle, look I've walked in those woods all my life and not once has a bird hollered like that it also just didn't sound like a bird whistle but maybe i'm mistaken, i'm almost sure it was someone or maybe an object and i thought it may of been the gate unlocking but i really don't know. To describe it the best i can it was like

""Whoooo hooooo (a space of silence that was about 3-4 seconds) Whoooo hooooo"" but it sounded like a whistle and it was really loud so i don't think it was the gate unlocking since it was a decent distance away from us at the time.

Me and my friend just looked at each other said nope, and ran. I have asthma and its cold outside so i had to stop running but we made some distance. While running we heard the whistle do the same thing so i ran even faster. We stopped about 3/4 the way to the main trail and started walking, my friend said that we can talk later but lets just get the hell out of there. We made it to the park right next to the path and we just slowed down and walked in a couple circles, i kept my eyes on the woods but i didn't see anything (also while running i kept looking back but i never saw anything)

Me: ""Ok what the hell was that?""

Friend: "" I-i don't fucking know a damn bird or something

Me: ""Yeah, yeah and what about the damn ice-cream truck music, and also I've never heard a bird sounding like that""

Friend: ""Lets just go get some food i really don't know man""

I looked back but i never saw anything but i'm still shook

Look i have no idea what that was and it was probably just some other teens or a hobo trying to make people leave them alone (we were talking pretty loud so it's not like they couldn't hear us coming) The whistle could've been a bird but i really don't think it was, i have no idea what that ice cream truck music was. I might go back one day but not anytime soon and especially without a weapon. The part that creepted me out was that i told my step dad about it and he said that he heard something like that too (i don't know if he was near the same path but i don't believe so) remember its right after Christmas time and its cold as hell so we both didn't think it was a real ice-cream truck.

I live in the Ohio area but i don't want to share anymore info, if anyone's ever had that same experience then please comment or message me i would love to know your experience. And if anyone has any theory's on what happened please say them me and my friend don't really know what to think."
t3_ejc6ka,all_ads,"Do you believe when someone who lives with you, is doing bad evil things, that it brings the ""spirits"" and ""hauntings"" into your home?",Thetruthishere,"I do believe this to be very true. My father was doing some awful things secretly for years,and we had a very physical ""force"" that did some freaky as hell incidences. It has only been around my father. When my parents divorced, my father moved into a nicer newer house and it's presence was there as well. We moved to another state with my mom.
  Also, it is the only time I have ever had sleep paralysis. Ever. My incident though was right before my parents announced they were getting a divorce. I went to take a bath and on the closed bathroom door was a mounted full length mirror. The bathtub is right next to the door, and the toilet was at the end of the bathroom and right in front of the toilet is a stand up shower stall like spot. I go to the bathroom and I had just gotten undressed and as I am walking to get in the tub, I hear a loud glassy shattering noise and the full length mirror was falling all over into the tub and floor. Instantly the pure feeling of straight terror ran through my soul as I was screaming and crying. My mom came rushing and opened the door asking me what the fuck just happened? I couldn't explain it, just balled my eyes out.
   The worst of the worst is when my dad was trying to wake me up from a nightmare. I was screaming about water and my dad physically took me to the tub and even starting spanking me as he turned on the water and yelling at me what was wrong about the water. When I woke up, I quit crying, and was scared as to why my dad was yelling at me by the bathtub. I didn't remember anything about my nightmare. But when my dad told me about it later he was saying I was screaming bloody murder about water. 
  I've had other things, alot of bad experiences in that house, when we talk about it, all my siblings have their own wtf stories and vibes. I wish the paranormal shit wasn't real..but I can't deny it. The alice room( a room that used to be an attic converted to a play area) that was the only upstairs room that had a half size door, is how this entity got our attention and fear..but that's longer of a story...anyways.
  What do you think? I believe 100% that doing negative shit, brings evil shit."

t3_ejm511,all_ads,Daughter,Thetruthishere,"My husband and I lived the top half of a duplex and strange things were always happening. Once on a Saturday night and he was working and our teenage kids were out, I had went to use the bathroom. There was no water. I thought, how strange, so I went down the back stairs, made sure I locked the door, to check the meter. It was off, so I turned it back on and went back up the stairs. The door was wide open and all of the kitchen cabinets were open. I grabbed our baseball bat and checked the entire place for Intruders, found no one and nothing was missing. A month later, around 2 a.m. someone was pounding on the backdoor, calling for us to open the door. I woke my husband and he didn't hear anything and didn't find anyone. We moved a month later."
t3_ejmxmx,all_ads,The shadow figure,Thetruthishere,"I have never posted anything on here before and I’m not the best with spelling and grammar so forgive me in advance. But the year was 2012 I was a sophomore in high school. I had just moved into a house that we were renting. Funny enough one of my friends rented that house right before me. It was a strange old house. It had shag carpet and even a wood burning furnace that could be used to heat the house. I’d say this house was probably built in the 70,s it had two basements my parents room was on the first lower floor and then there was an unfinished part that was pretty big. I decided to finish putting up drywall and flooring and make the lowest floor my room with my older brother. We finished it in about 4 days and we soon moved all our stuff down there soon after. While finishing it we found this weird door that was bullet proof and fire proof and could only be opened from the outside. The room was barely big enough to stand in. We thought it was super weird. We also were storing away old boxes underneath the stairs and while we were doing that we found that there was a hidden panel going even further under the stairs. I opened it and crawled in slowly cause I was scared as shit. As soon as I crawled in there I froze in place. This weird creepy feeling like someone was watching me. I stand frozen on all fours until my mom asked me if I was okay. “Yeah thought I saw a demon I jokingly said” I kept crawling only to find a weird shag carpeted and I mean carpet everywhere the walls and ceiling.  It had enough room for maybe two people to lay inside the ceiling was low and so you would be constantly in the crouched position.  There was also not lights in there. “It’s just a carpeted little room! The dude who made this house probably stored bodies in this room” I jokingly said as I was turning around I see my older brother close the panel behind me as a prank. Once he did it was pitch dark and the same ominous feeling came back. I panicked and kicked the panel clean off and hit my brother in the face with it. 

A few months pass and It was strange living there especially in my room on the lowest level. when I’d rally the boys and we’d hangout down there and I didn’t feel anything weird. But when I was alone I could feel it. Like something ominous and scary was behind me at all times just watching. 

One night I couldn’t sleep so I laid in bed playing Pokémon on my game boy SP.  the room was dimly lit by the light of my fan right next to my bed. When I looked across the room to see a all black figure standing behind the couch. I would have said it looked like a person but it didn’t. It was about 7ft y’all and the build of what I imagine an alien would have. Long skinny arms that reached to its knees. And a mouth that looked like it reached ear to ear. I couldn’t see much detail due to the fact there wasn’t much light. When I looked at it my body got chills and felt this sense of impending doom. Like I was in danger! So I did the best and smartest thing one could do. I retreated under the covers. I was too scared to call my brothers name who was asleep. I was too scared to do anything at all. I’ll I could do as summon the courage to lift up my covers to confirm what I saw and make sure I wasn’t just crazy as soon as I lift the covers a little bit I see the figure of ahead at the edge of my bed about 1 foot away from my face! If I could see it’s face I’m sure I was staring directly into it eyes. I quickly recovered my face and immediately started praying like I never have before. My intense praying out loud woke up my brother and I was speechless. I said it was a nightmare I had in fear he would think I’m crazy. I told no one. 

A week or so pass and my entire family is leaving for a family reunion. I had work so I had to stay home. The night they left i had every light in the house on because I was afraid the shadow figure would return if it was dark. Hours pass of me just vibing out and gaming and i thought to myself, “maybe I really was seeing things?” I finally decide to turn in for the night at around 3:00 in the morning. I decided to leave the lights on while I slept cause let’s be honest, you all would too. While I’m walking to my bed I feel the ominous feeling again. This time more intense than before. I look behind me slowly and there it is again... but I can see the details this time. It’s eyes were pitch black and it was smiling with yellow stained sharp teeth and it’s mouth was massive like I thought. It was also heavily scared on the parts of its body where clothes would normally be. I froze for a second and we just sat there staring at each other for what felt like an eternity. Then a tear shed from its left eye. I took a deep breath and booked it out the house and didn’t come back until my family returned 2 days later. 

I decided to talk to my friend who lived in the house before me about it. He had to know something right? And I felt like I could trust him. When we met he could tell something shook me up. I opened up to him and told him the whole experience. After I told him he got pale in the face. And looked like he might of shit himself due to him shifting back and forth uncomfortably.  “ you moved downstairs dude are you fucking retarded?!?!” My friend said. “That was our storage room and me and my friend Matt saw it down there crawling around in between the storage boxes. It even talked to me a few times...”. “Well what the hell did it say to you?!?” I asked. “ it only said “help me” 

Soon after that we had the bishop of my church come and bless the house. He told me that evil beings feed off the power of belief and negativity. So next time something weird happens or you see something try to think of a logical way for that thing to happen even if you know it’s not true.

Keeping what he said in mind one night I went to sleep and a pool ball fell off the pool table right as I was getting into bed. I thought about what he said and I thought to myself, “maybe I left the pool ball on the edge of the table and the air from the fan knocked it over?” Ive been doing that ever since and eventually it stopped.

Because it seems a common theme among ghosts, demons, angels, UFOs, etc... is that they may in fact be results of parallel planes/realities/worlds interacting with one another I thought it might be interesting to try an EVP experiment to contact someone from one of them. Granted just pulling out a voice recorder and asking for someone to come through would be far from ideal, who is to say that the results wouldn't get contaminated?

I had to devise a method to pinpoint an exact person to talk to. Someone who would be ""sensitive"" to these things, but would be knowledgeable to know how to respond. Basically I charted a path that would work, in concept, like messages bouncing through space to a satellite before they are delivered to another person.

While it would be interesting to contact ""me"" from another Earth, the limitations of the experiment made it so this wouldn't be a smart in order to produce genuine results. Who's to say I wouldn't just alter the clips to make it seem like I got something? Who's to say that isn't what I did?

Though it isn't a smart thing to do, all I have to offer at this time is to validate the potential SOMETHING came through is my word.

The experiment is ongoing. The link below is to a set of audio clips from the first test, all I need now is a few good ears to listen and report back on what they heard. In order to prevent potentially priming you to hear certain things I don't want to share too many details on how the experiment is being conducted just yet, but I will be honest the intended target won't be difficult to guess.

Please do be respectful in your commentary.

t3_ejo5ev,all_ads,Recurring Dream,Thetruthishere,"Hey everyone, (If my engrish isn't at a comprehensible level bare with me uwu)

I didn't thought much of it at the time and didn't tell anyone about my dreams and experience however 2 months ago the same dream haunted me once more i asked myself if i was the only one having this sort of experience. 

Back when i was a little kid when i was around 5 to 6 years old i used to have frequent recurring uncontrollable dreams but the one that stood out the most was this one. Now before i explain this dream i want to mention that as a kid i was that sensitive always run to your mom's/dad's bedroom type of guy. I couldn't explain what i was going through at the time and i was full of different emotions and have always felt like something was watching me. Anyways back to the dream,

I used to live in a apartment building which was 5 floors high and i lived at the third floor. I rememberd that i woke up in this vivid dream which was in the (apartmennt building) with angelic like wings you know those kinda cupid like wings which was attached to my back and the wings were very long and wide. I tried to move those wings focusing on my back but whenever i tried i failed. I remember walking to the balcony (which was three balconies high) as if i was prepared to jump with the attention to fly. Now back at the time when you look down at the ground you'd see a big street and a fence with spikes made out of wood protecting gardening flowers directly in front of my balcony. After getting the courage and the thoughts that i could fly i jumped off the balcony and tried moving my shoulders but it failed as i fastly moved towards the ground as my body went through the wooden spikes, i was dead. Immediately when i died i'd wake up shocked and out of breath gasping for air. At that day when the dream occurred the next 5 days that came after that day had the exact same dream and experience, time and time again i died. 

I didn't feel like telling my parents or my sisters/brother my story because at the time thinking they would think of me as a idiot, Lol. This happened in 2000 now in late 2019 i had the same dream but instead of being little i was a grown man with a ego so big even mounts couldn't reach it thinking i could reach the heavens because i am the main character in my dream and who besides myself will allow me to fall in disgrace towards a tiny wooden spiked fence, I wouldn't allow it as i would feel inferior towards the wooden spiked fence! HOWEVER, i lost. The wooden spikes had yet again gained a champagne of victory and i walked out of the dream a sore loser with no backbone. (Trying to be sarcastic here help me out budies. ) Anyways, this was the dream if anyone knows what the hell this could mean or had the same experience please share your thoughts in the comments down below and thank you in advance, peace"

t3_ej8v3d,all_ads,Angels singing,Thetruthishere,I just experienced a super vivid dream where I felt asleep but very awake at the same time. I heard what sounded like angels singing loudly in a beautiful tone then I saw bright colours swirling towards me. What could this mean?

t3_ejbjkc,all_ads,My Guitar and Destiny,Thetruthishere,"Just a little story. I thought I'd share this since it happened either yesterday or today, not sure, I've been working on my guitar a good bit over the last 48 hours or so, so it all kind of begins to blend. 

Anyway. A few days ago, I snapped my E string on my guitar as I was trying to tune all the strings down a step. It happens. Made me a little jumpy, but I held my head up high and decided I'd replace all the strings and put on a new set for the new year. I've always felt a certain closeness to music and the more I play guitar, the stronger the feeling is. As though it's my destiny.

Fast forward to yesterday. I was doing my best to get all the strings on. I should maybe mention my guitar's name is Rory. I named him after Rory Storm, of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. He was a musician in the 50s and 60s in Liverpool and I'm sweet on him. 

In any case, I get all of Rory's (the guitar, silly) strings off, and I watch some videos to get a feel for how to put the new ones on, and I go for it. I played some of the Hurricanes music and some of another musician Rory Storm liked while I put it on, teasingly telling my guitar that maybe if I put on some music he liked, that he'd behave for me.

All the strings worked out. Perfectly. The strange thing happened while I began to tune it.

I could hear someone singing, just within the sound of the notes as I tuned my guitar. A perfect, angelic kind of tone. It made me stop a few times and just listen to it, echoing the note of the string and sounding even clearer once I had it tuned up right.

It didn't happen again after I got the guitar in tune and it didn't happen when I tuned it again today, but I thought it was a beautiful little thing that just cemented my love of music and my feeling of being drawn to it. And anyway, I gave Rory a big hug after all that. So you got it, universe, I'll keep on playing."
t3_ejb26u,all_ads,I might have been possessed?,Thetruthishere,"i don’t know where to put this. i tried on r/Paranormal about a month ago, but the mods deleted it, so i’m trying it here. i copied and pasted it into a document so i could put it somewhere else. i’m only posting again because i found this sub, and because things are getting especially weird.

a few months ago, i was tipsy but not drunk.  i went on my computer because i had been testing out using the text-based game maker called Twine and i wanted to mess around. it was around midnight and i was really tired, so i was only on Twine for about five minutes before i went to bed.  when i woke up and went back to my computer, there was something i didn't remember typing:

[this is what i wrote](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ds0z6hb)

here is the text of the full page:

&gt;what’s your favorite color?

&gt;I HEAR WHAT I SE3E I HEAR THE OGDS I HEAR GOD S I HEr hikm in my monlogoue i hear the shadows i hear what i say ik hear what i think i cant dexcice woheciase o a, odead /i BELIEVE

&gt;i know that i am a god amonbgst em nit os that necaise o a, a wp,am pr ni\\

i thought that i remembered the entire sequence of events. i had a very clear recollection of everything that happened. i don't drink a lot (maybe once a month).  i have never even drank enough to get a hangover. the worst i've had is dehydration. i've never browned out. i've never blacked out. the morning after, i had a very good memory of going up to my room, sitting at my desk for a few minutes, and then going to bed. but i guess something happened.

i have seen strange shadows and heard noises my entire life.  i have also always been sensitive to sensations ( feeling of someone touching you or something moving when it isn't, constant chills and twitches, feeling like something is wrong or someone is watching me or feelings of a liminal space, and especially getting weird sensations around mirrors and dark corners ). i was told this was just my mental illness.

note: i do not have schizophrenia or anything like it. i do have severe anxiety that i have had since infancy.  until i was 15, i had anxiety-induced insomnia or chronic insomnia.

i really really wanted to believe this was my mental illness but since this event, things have been getting worse. the shadows are getting darker and moving more. things are moving and disappearing. the liminality sticks longer and the chills are worse. the someone touching/something moving against me is almost every day. all of these can be explained with higher anxiety/mental illness but the thing is that my life outside of this is better than it was before. i moved to a better college this semester and began excelling in my classes. i have friends and have been meeting new people.  i finished my exams and passed them all with B-'s or better. the stress hasn't been that bad.

this anxiety feels different than how it used to.  it's not about anything tangible or anything that's happening to me.  it's like i feel like someone is watching me, or i'm registering a frequency that i can't actually hear. i only ever felt this way as a child, and things have been happening a lot more lately that is really, really freaking me out.  i feel like i might be going insane.

when this happened, i was home alone with my dog. my parents were gone for the night. no one else could have written it ( physically, at least ).

i am beginning to legitimately believe this is paranormal.  i don't know why i would block out the few moments of my life it took to type out this string of near nonsense.  was this some kind of like…possession? is this a haunting? i have a theory that my insomnia as a child might have been because of my sensitivity to spirits or liminal spaces or whatever it is, but i don't know if that's even viable.

please let me know what you think.

t3_ejbrqa,all_ads,"Not sure if I'm posting in the right place, but I think I might have pre-birth memories.",Thetruthishere,"I don't mean memories of another life here on earth, as many people speak of, but of some existence in another realm. See, for as long as I can remember I've had this image in my head of a very large, tall room/space filled with silent, floating angelic beings. I remember the atmosphere being very pink and light, and at the front of this room stand an enormous grandfather clock, I'm talking maybe 50 feet high. Like I said, I have no clue why this has been in my head all these years. It very well could have just been some weird dream that I've always remembered for some reason, but something about it just feels so real, so crucial to have stuck with me all this time.

I also have this weird sense of familiarity regarding an enchanted garden with tall plants surrounding a little dirt path. There were giant mushrooms and other kinds of magical things. Something about this imagery also feels kind of deja vu, and I wish I could explain it."
t3_eiumss,all_ads,The Silver Chickens and Golden Eggs,Thetruthishere,"I have a pretty interesting story that I feel like you all will appreciate, I attribute this one singular event to be the catalyst of my faith in the spiritual dimension that runs parallel to our reality. It involves my mom, younger brother and my grandfather.  

My mom and I were really close to my grandfather mostly due to the fact that she was his only daughter and I’m the oldest grandkid out of 17 cousins. My mom was only 18 when she had me and still living with my grandparents. Due to the fact that she and both my father worked full time jobs, he took over as my babysitter/life coach/mentor and just about every childhood memory that I have, he’s included with it. When I was about 13-14 he fell sick with breast cancer (fairly rare for a man) which the later spread throughout his lungs and other various organs. I specifically remember us all being around him in his hospital bed and praying for his peace while he essentially said his final goodbyes to us all. My mom was the person to leave the room with him on his last day, which he later passed that evening, and when she walked out of the room she was crying but she also just stared at me so intensely. Leaving the hospital, my mom had said that “Pawpaw said that he’s at peace and last night he dreamed that he was with her son (assumably at the time meaning me) in heaven and it was beautiful! He said that when he arrived to heaven he was greeted with the most beautiful Silver Chicken and Golden Eggs!” This scared the hell out of me in a way because I grew up with an irrational fear of dying but it also made me feel relieved that he kind of found peace through me. 

So the next year, my mom miraculously gets pregnant with a boy (12 years younger than my only sister which definitely makes him an accident) and it definitely came as a surprise to all of us. It took some adjusting but I was really happy to have a younger brother finally. 

Let’s fast forward another 4 years and now my grandmother passes away.. I was also very close to her too and her death was much harder for me to come to grips with after feeling the permanence of my grandfathers death only a few years before. About a few weeks after the service, my immediate family and my two uncles went to help clean up and basically tend my grandparents house. 

As we were sorting out things throughout the house, I heard my little brother start crying from the next room and we all sort of rushed to check in on him and he was holding a picture of my grandfather with his two favorite dogs while crying hysterically. My mom then picked him up and asked him why he was so upset, we thought he cut himself on something or hit his head maybe because he was literally beside himself. He responded to my “Mom... that’s pawpaw... that’s pawpaw... I miss him so much much..” and then my mom replied “Baby, I’m sure he would have loved you so much but pawpaw died before you were born.. how can you possibly miss him?” (...and I still get chills to this very day thinking about what happened next..) My little brother responded, “Momma, I know pawpaw!!... he was with me in heaven!!... with the Silver Chickens and Golden Eggs!!.. I know pawpaw, Momma!!... I know him and I miss him!!...” Everyone in the room just kind of looked at each other and then I walked out of the room and cried (I’m a big crier). I could here my mom asking him again like she couldn’t believe it but his answer remained the same every single time. We asked everyone in our family if they told him the story and everyone was just as shocked as we were when we told them what happened. 

My grandfather was not a spiritual man in any sense of the word. He was a Korea Veteran that spent his post war days selling avocados out of his van with a friend he met in the war up and down the pacific coast. I’ve never seen this man pray or even say anything about “god” unless it was to curse at one of us for being bad. All of that just made this all so much more surreal and unbelievable. After processing what my younger brother said we then thought back to what my grandfather said and he knew that my mom would be having another son before she was even pregnant! Ah is exacts words were “I was with your son” not my name specifically which he knew and addressed me as always. Pretty crazy stuff. 

So yeah, that pretty much caused me to accept the fact that there is more to our reality than what our senses can perceive and what science can explain. I have only shared this story with one of my girlfriends and she essentially called us all liars and never accepted it as truth so I left her a few months later. She’s addicted to meth and a lesbian now (not that it’s a bad thing) so I don’t take it too hard."
t3_eioo74,all_ads,A dream,Thetruthishere,"I used to be a heroin addict and it happened during a drug induced sleep. I got high and closed my eyes and in my mind I began soaring over something I couldn’t define. As I moved forward I could feel the wind rushing past me but I couldn’t hear anything. 

As I looked below and around me I could see my surroundings taking shape as a landscape, the most beautiful mountains and rivers and ice caps and waterfalls, and as I began to recognize each thing for what it was it felt like my essence, the very things that make me me, were departing from me. I could feel myself being pieced apart, each piece evaporating from my core. I didn’t feel afraid, more that I was understanding without a doubt that I was dying. I was being recycled. 

Once I became aware that if I kept flying forward I would eventually be gone everything slowed. I pulled back on the urge to move forward. And then I was just floating. And then I was falling, I fell for what seemed forever. As I was falling I looked up and the sky had become dark and full of the most amazing stars I’d ever seen. I felt at peace. 

I woke up in my room with a gasp, like I hadn’t been breathing. The breath burned my throat and I realized I had vomited in my sleep and it was all down my neck and the front of my sweatshirt. I just started crying. I remembered the dream and knew that I had just very nearly overdosed. It still haunts me thinking that if I hadn’t become lucid and made the choice to pull away from the beauty and serenity of that scene, it was drawing me in, then I believe I would have died. I truly believe it."

t3_eitq5k,all_ads,Is NYE an especially active time for the spirits?,Thetruthishere,"My adult daughter has always been sensitive to the paranormal in that she sees ghosts/spirits. She isn't especially glad about it but tries to take it in her stride.

NYE was a doozy for her in this regard, slightly unsurprising, considering we spent it in a place that has a lot of 'energy', with friends who very recently lost a loved one in bad circumstances. 

It's a long story, a lot happened, including she had new experiences which included actually being spoken to by the departed (yelled at, in fact) and being asked to pass on messages. Not only that, she encountered an animal spirit for the first time and also received a message. 

She was also told that NYE is a big night for the spirits. 

Did anyone else have a paranormal New Year's? 

(Also, no she does not have any kind of mental illness or delusions before I get those messages)"
t3_eiqup1,all_ads,"of course, freaky things start happening right before the new year starts",Thetruthishere,"this is a small thing but it was still kinda freaky. 

so New Year's Eve was yesterday so I had two friends over. My family was upstairs while we were goofing off in the basement.  while we are down there the three of us hear a super loud metal clang. I thought it came from the room next to the one we were in so I called out but got zero response. My two friends both thought that it had come from above us. we brushed it off imagining that someone upstairs had dropped something. a few minutes later my mom and sister came down into the basement asking if we were okay and what fell. we looked around and nothing had fallen over. The weird thing is that the sound was loud enough to be heard throughout the entire house and everyone was hearing it come from different areas of the house. 

no one could find where the sound came from.

it was just a really strange experience."
t3_eixn4q,all_ads,Dreamed original Metallica song that does not exist?,Thetruthishere,"So, I just woke up from a dream that was quite peculiar and, since I didnt have a reddit account, but thought this might be the best place to share, I created an account and hope this is a good place to post this..So, while I'm starting to forget some of the things, I do remember the main chorus of the song..I used to be quite a big Metallica fan, but its been years and years since I've actively listened to them. Which to me makes this a bit more strange.

The song guitar wise was a mixture of the Black Album Era, and Reload? What was even more interesting, is I cant say for certain now, but I think I was watching the music video on a T.V. The lead guitarist was a female instead of Kirk Hammett. She actually was quite attractive, and very talented, although she was playing in a strange way, using some futuristic Headstock of the guitar to play the solo part.

.

As for the song lyrics, I can only remember the chorus now. The chorus was:

""Dear lord, delight, we have your soul tonight.""

.

The parts were sung separated. Singing ""Dear lord"" together, but drawing out the words about 1 second each. Then a pause for about 2 seconds, then delight sung exactly how Dear lord was, breaking up the syllables, singing them for about 1 second each. ... and after writing all that up I'm forgetting how the last part was sung lol. I think ""we have your"" was sung quickly then, soul tonight sung similarly to the start?.

I actually really liked the song, and thought maybe I heard it from one of the times I checked out their new music. I kinda stopped listening to them after Reload, and tried getting back into them during St. Anger, and heard ... Hard Wired to Self Destruct went back to their Black Album, and listened to a few songs from that album but couldnt recall any if you asked me now.

.

So I guess, has anyone had any experience with this? I also wanted to record it because I saw another post elsewhere, maybe even reddit, where someone said that later that the musician was recording the song.

.

I would like to note, I am quite fascinated with things like this, and would enjoy reading what people say."
t3_eibjnd,all_ads,Possible angel encounter in ATL,Thetruthishere,"I was in Atlanta a few years ago walking with my mom down a sidewalk. We walked straight down the road never changing our direction, for the entire story. I think we may have been near Five Points but not sure- it wasn’t a crowded area and no one else was on the side walk but us. Until this man walked right past... but he was going the opposite way. He looked homeless, he was white, and he had a bunch of strange jewelry on and an odd outfit. He was walking in a way that was almost like a tiptoe dance and I think he may have been talking gibberish to himself. 
After another three or four blocks, my mom and I were about to go through a crosswalk at an intersection when I looked up and saw the SAME man directly across the road in front of us. It made no sense, because we had passed him minutes ago. It seemed physically impossible and there weren’t any blocks he could have looped around to reverse his course, let alone do it that fast. 
Someone honked and yelled at him as he went through the crosswalk, I guess for looking strange :/ When he finally passed my mom and I, he looked at us and said “Do you have a quarter?” I looked at him and was startled by how vividly BLUE his eyes were. I didn’t even have my wallet or phone on me, and I said “I’m sorry but I don’t have anything,” and he quickly said “It’s okay” with a kind look in his eyes. 
I wonder if it was a test, not to necessarily give him the quarter but just to honestly answer the question and treat him like a person, which he was. I was also struck by how normal he was when we spoke and looked at each other, because I had initially seen him talking to himself and dancing around. 
Anyway, I would love to hear any thoughts"

t3_ei6e4b,all_ads,Dreams that are too real... TOO real.,Thetruthishere,"Hey reddit. I have a weird one for you and its been going on since I was 7, and I'm pretty sure I'm either dimension hopping or having some insane out of body experiences (or I really just AM crazy).

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I have these ""dreams"" when I sleep where, and bare with my lack of writing luster, I ""wake up"" in my dream and its \*reality\*. I ""wake up"" in my bed, just as it was when I went to sleep but time is still in this reality. When I return to my body/bed in this ""dream"" I wake up in ACTUAL reality but theres signs of what I did in the dream world and its starting to freak me out more.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start with my oldest memory of it: I would ""wake"" up in my bunk bed and would walk outside my house. I had this ability to basically \*double jump\* and would float/fly kind of? I would hover myself to the playground(which was attached to the grade-school) behind my house  and would stargaze or move the school toys around so when I actually woke up I would know where my favorite toys were hiding. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I actually woke up I had full memory of this dream, I would have dirt on my clothes, or my hair would actually be tangled almost like it was windswept. The weirdest part is the toys sometimes would be where I hid them the following morning. Kids in our grade-school didnt organize the toys after recess, we'd check in (yes we had a check in/out system) them in a big trashcan and go inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Next big milestone was middle-school I had similar dreams with the floating ability except it wasnt the playground or toys I would instead now just float to the retention pond area next to my house and would just look up at the stars from atop the giant willow tree. It was my favorite spot and I would frequent this place. Now with this one, only like twice out of hundreds of times I found willow leaves in my bed with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This continued for years until highschool when my stress/depression was so bad I stopped dreaming all-together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked about it with a therapist during highschool who said I was most likely sleep walking however I disproved that easily by tying myself to my bed, setting up bells on my doors and windows, and asking my parents if theyve ever noticed me sleep walking. The answer was no, and none of my safeguards ever moved/changed the mornings when I woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Im now 27, married, living with my husband and my dreams have returned here or there. I ""wake up"" my husband next to me, our cats on our bed, and now for some reason I'm floating around aimlessly and feel miserable and lost. I look up and its just this hazy purple/black sky with no stars anymore. I begin to feel extremely detached and almost ""warp"" back to my body and ACTUALLY wake up feeling exhausted, drained, and empty. I've noticed bruises forming on my back and legs more often too. Like 3 bruises in either a straight line or a triangle like pattern. Unsure if related or not just thought I'd put that here too.

&amp;#x200B;

Its so odd because if I dont have these dreams I'm extremely happy/healthy and doing great.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else have weird hyper realistic dreams that leave you feeling extremely detached from reality/your body/life?"

t3_eieuzl,all_ads,The night my friend was attacked by an entity.,Thetruthishere,"This is first time post one any site so sorry if it is long and boring. Thank you for reading. 



I use to work door to door sales with electricity for 7 years. I used to work late nights in rural areas. This night I was out with one of my friend/coworkers. We had been out there till about 11 pm. I had been feeling something following us for about 2 hours. I kept my friend close but didn’t tell him why. He just thought I was helping him get sales since he was at 0 for the day. I get the call saying we are gonna be picked up in about 10 minutes so I go to the spot where we told to meet the team. I was starring about two hundred feet away cause I can see there things/entities walking towards us. I told my friend who was walking across the street to come stand next to me because something was heading our way. (Now i was prerecord from a long time before this thanks to a protection spell placed on me. My friend was not protected but he would be if he stayed with in 3 feet of me.) The three beings where all different the one in the lead was hunched over but still stood about 7 1/2 feet tall it’s face was distorted in a permanent snarl one of the arms was missing and the other had only three fingers complete. The second one was much shorter standing about 4’9’’It looked mostly normal except for this goo running it face and arms. The third one was average height but missing arm and a foot and it was leaking everywhere. I told my friend one last time to come stand near me and why. He just laughed it off and said was making things up that ghost or demons. He continued to basically play on the other side of the street and stated taunting the the three beings walking towards us. I told him to stop or he will be attacked. He said it won’t happen and taunted more loudly now. I start shaking my head in frustration and as I straighten up I see my friend fly 7 feet into the ditch. I see the first entity standing there looking at him so I walk to him and as I get close to the entity practically run to get away from me. My friend looks up and yells why did you push me. I told him how did I push you from across the street and beside I don’t have enough strength to send you 7 feet. He looks at me and asks in a low voice was that one of the things you said was following us. I reply with yes and help him up. I pull him up and we walked over the the spot where we where gonna be picked up. When we get there he says my back hurts a lot. I lift his shirt and he is scratched from shoulder blade to his hip. When we get picked up he is limping from fall so bad that everyone notices but he tells them he fell and it was nothing. When we get home (we live together cause he didn’t have a place to stay) I had my aunt put holy water on his back. Has the water hit his back went up in smoke and he screamed bloody murder for about 5 minutes. The makers went away and he never doubted me again."

t3_ehvyqd,all_ads,A Visit in my Dream,Thetruthishere," My Aunt passed away in June, this was an especially time to have lost her because every year she would throw a Fourth of July party complete with huge fireworks and now we would have to do it without her.

&amp;#x200B;

The day or two before the Fourth of July, I had a dream that I was watching the fireworks in the sky, I heard her call to me and looked to see her looking over a fence waving.



Her face was slightly distorted at first, but soon enough I recognized her as my Aunt. As she waved she told me she loves me, and that she is saying goodbye, and reassuring me saying that our Fourth celebration will go on without her. As she was done speaking, I woke up."
t3_ehw959,all_ads,Hands,Thetruthishere,"When I was four, I was helping my father clean up and repair my Grandmother's back patio.  Since I was four this mostly consisted of me playing and occasionally handing my dad something he asked for.  The patio was made of flagstones, and we were rearranging some and picking up broken ones to be replaced.

I moved a few broken pieces out of the way and noticed something white in the dirt.  I dug for a bit and then called my dad over because it was bones and I felt I shouldn't touch them.  It was the bones of a hand not much bigger than my own.  My dad ended up turning them over to the police, and I later found out that the house there prior to my grandmother's had burned down with a man and his son inside.  So, my dad said it was probably the kid's hand, though he didn't know why they hadn't found it when the family was buried after the fire was put out.

After the hand was dug up, I started seeing the ghost of a boy with no hand bones.  His hands were so floppy and gross.  He was wearing old fashioned looking blue and white pajamas and he never talked.  He looked super sad and really pale with big circles under his eyes.  He used to follow me around while I was trying to play and I'd tell him to go away and leave me alone (parents saw me shouting at him a lot though of course they couldn't see him) since he was so weird.

The creepiest thing he would do is ooze out of the heating vent in my playroom, floppy hands first.  Could not stand that kid.

In the woods behind my grandmother's house, at night I'd often see a ghost light wandering around.  Years after the hand incident, I saw it was a lantern being carried by a middle aged due with a greyed out beard.  I told my dad what he looked like and he said he thought it might be the dad who had died in the fire.  He called him Old Man Motley but I never found any news articles or anything so I think he just made the name up for me.  I saw him a few more times after that.  I think he was looking for his kid.  They both felt so strange and sad..."

The lights were on in the hallway and I remember seeing a shadow standing there. Covering the cracks of light coming through the door.

t3_eh843i,all_ads,Angels We Have Heard On High,Thetruthishere,"When I was in 6th grade my swim coach passed away from cancer. I had been family friends with her since I was a baby. She was the first person my mom connected with after I was born and we moved to a new city. 

I was destroyed after her death. I spelled out her name with sticks in my front yard hoping that she would see me and watch over me. I remember not being able to go to school for about a week because I was constantly crying. 

At her funeral, they played Angels We Have Heard On High, and that song stuck with me. Not because it was Christmas time, but because she wanted that song played because she loved it (she passed in May, far from the appropriate time for that song to be played). 

I’ve noticed that every time I’m in a rut, wherever I am, I somehow hear that song.

I remember being at a swim meet in middle school, feeling incredibly unprepared. I had been doubting my abilities to swim for a while, but a woman’s ringtone in the bleachers I had been sitting on was Angels We Have Heard On High. Her phone rang, and my doubt melted away (i got second in my event that day!)

I was incredibly depressed in high school. I had no friends, no supportive home life, nothing. I remember hearing that song after my teacher let auto play run through and it was the next video. My worries felt less intense. 

There were a few other moments I heard this song that I remember, but they aren’t as important. 

I live next door to a church now, and they ring their bells often. But this morning, I was struggling quite hard due to my mom being diagnosed with thyroid cancer and my boss won’t give me the days off to see her after her surgery. I was laying in bed crying when all of a sudden I hear the same song, but this time, it was the bells playing it.

I 100% believe this is my old swim coach watching over me. Any time I’m struggling, I hear that song and know everything is going to be okay."

t3_ehgrm3,all_ads,Convincing a Soft Skeptic,Thetruthishere,"I’m something of a ‘soft skeptic’ in the paranormal, but have a strong will to believe that there’s something being the material everyday world.  So, I’m looking for advice on how to convince myself that there’s truth to strange happenings, ideally via direct personal experience.  

Some background - I’m a scientist by training, doing my PhD right now in biochemistry.  I’m very analytical, and I’ve always tried to understand the world by learning objective truths about it.  I also have a hardwired sense of skepticism, which is part of what drew me to science - I have a hard time believing anything without knowing how it works or at least having some empirical evidence of it.  

Analytically, though, I have trouble believing that the material world is all there is... I have a sense that there are deeper truths to be found.  But my inherent skepticism holds me back here - looking at some foggy photos of supposed paranormal happenings just isn’t enough.  

All this to say, I’m asking if any of you can suggest anything that I can do to *intentionally* have a paranormal, supernatural, or otherwise mystifying experience that’s enough to kill my skepticism and let me move forward.  Any suggestions are appreciated!"
t3_ehd2cc,all_ads,Infested by the GNOMES!,Thetruthishere," 

This is going to be a list of all the gnome encouters (possibly) I’ve had, and I cannot explain. I beleive these spirits are curious and not nessecarily melevolant, but I beleive they are keeping an eye on my family 24/7.

Before I begin, I beleive the gnomes are starting to appear because of a recently cut down forest. I have a rich farmer living next door and he completely cut down the tree line that marked in between my family’s property, and his. We’ve been noticing the whole forest on our side is dying. In the last year 5 or so trees have fallen, while 10 are currently dying and are predicted to fall sometime in 2020.

This forest, I ABSOLUTELY ADORED! The whole forest was beautiful when the rays of sun entered. It felt magical, and it felt like I had a spiritual connection to it. I remember hearing crows in the air, and I remember seeing owls and owl pellets. I don’t fully beleive this, however, I beleive that this forest had some sort of wierd connection with each other, As though, maybe this forest was for ALL to be in. Like a home! At the time, I didn’t see any gnomes, or any mini-holes or huts, but I still felt that wierd feeling. What’s even stranger is that after the trees were cut down, hawks began appearing. It felt as though and overwhelming amount of darkness was surrounding the trees. At night, even today, I’m afraid to even enter the forest. It’s as though the darkness will consume me, something will pop out and kill me.

The first ever experience, that I can CONFIRM as truly unexplainable, is one August Night. I was trying to fall asleep, rolling around the bedsheets, and turned to ny left. That’s when I felt I should turn to my right, and what happened, was remarkable. I turn around, and right at my nerf gun, was a creature, no bigger than a Popko! Figure, with green skin, little white hairs sticking out of it’s bald head, and raggity clothes. I watched as this creature picked up the huge nerf weapon compared to it’s size. It was as though it was examining the weapon. I watched for what felt like hours, but was actually a few minutes. Suddenly, My heart sank and then started to pound. Fear was building up, I didn’t want it to know I saw it. I turned back to my left, and after contemplating, I turned back, and it was gone.

That’s not the only one, no no no...  


One October night (2018 to be EXACT), I was awake after reading a book, and I hear the sound of pitterpatter of feet on the roof. It sounded like scratching nails, as though something was climbing around. I was quite afraid, when I hear THUMP. Outside my porch door, where the porch of my bedroom is, I hear something fall off of the roof. I was quite afraid, and I hear unintelligible voices talking on the outside of my doorway. I still hear scratching and scurrying around, before it finally disappeared.  
Another Similar Experience happened, when I heard voices coming from the corner of my bedroom, where no one was there. Even after I turned my light on, I could still hear it. That's when I yelled SHUT UP! when everything went quite.  


 A more current experience was when I was writing up a prompt for a subreddit, of hearing voices in the forest, when, out of the corner of my eye, I see a green figure dash into one of the bushes in my parent’s garden. It was strange, cause we have no green creatures here in BC, and I clearly saw that it was humanoid, and not a snake. What was even wierder, is that the bush it entered kept shaking, as though something was going down in there. I was afraid of going over there, as I had an encounter with one prior, and didn’t know what it’d do. After 20 minutes of typing to [r/paranormal](https://www.reddit.com/r/paranormal/), I decided the best option was to go investigate. I grabbed a baseball, and went to the bush, peering over. Nothing. I thought that was strange.

Now, I told you about the voices, and some people think it could be the gnomes communicating. They seem similar, so I thought, what the heck.

So, I recently have a mall that was placed in my nextdoor neighbors place, and has a little park in between our properties. I was walking home after getting my subway sandwich, when clear as day I hear “HEY!” right behind me. I immediately turned around, no one was there.

It didn’t just happen once, but the SAME THING, SAME PLACE. I was walking back home from subway through the forest, and once I got uo ny property’s hill, I heard a voice, and this time it said my name “GARRET”. I turned around, thinking someone was playing a prank.

Once I heard my father’s voice yell my name, and guess what? My dad wasn’t even home.

I beleive that the gnomes are appearing, because of how many trees have been passing away so suddenly. Over 10 Trees on our property are dead or dying, and I think it’s because of our stupid rich neighbor.

Anyway, hope you liked this story, and I hope to talk to y’all soon. Merry Christmas  


P:S: I live in BC Canada, if anyone is wondering. If any of you British Columbians have any similar experiences, please share"
t3_ehb5ee,all_ads,Fairy? encounter,Thetruthishere,"I’m sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language. 
 
So this happened a really long time ago. I was on sixth grade (2012) during a soccer practice on the afternoon. 

I’ve always loved to wear at least one accessory, and that day I was wearing a necklace with an owl-charm. It was fairly new and one of my favorite accessories I possessed at that time. 
The training routine of the soccer team would always be something similar to this: 
     1. Warm up exercises
     2. Ball control exercises
     3. Quick game between the team members

While we were finishing the warm up exercises I remember touching my necklace only to find out that the owl charm was gone. We were running around the field so I remember I was running looking at the floor searching the whole time, but I didn’t find it. I was pretty sad the rest of the practice since I couldn’t find it. 

We were now playing the quick game to clase the practice and I was really spaced out the whole time. Suddenly I have the urge to look down to the grass to find some sort of light orb emerge from it. It flew towards me and passed by my side at the height of my cheek. This is kind of blurry since I didn’t get to see a detailed image of what was emitting the light, but I did see the some little human-like body, the color seemed sort of brown gray-ish. The wings were what I couldn’t see well since they were flapping really fast but I do remember thinking they reminded me of dragonfly wings. 

I turned around to follow it with my eyes, but it flew to were the sun was and it disappear. 

Still in awe at what I had seen I quickly go to the spot were I saw it come out from, and in its place was a single rock. I picked it only to see that the rock was clearly shaped like an owl, really similar to the charm I had lost. The rock was small but I could see the details of the eyes and feathers in the stomach. 

It was too much of a coincidence that I had lost the owl charm, then saw what I can only think was a fairy, and finally found a rock shaped like an owl.  

It saddens me that I no longer know where the stone is. I know I did bring it white me to my house but I’m afraid that maybe my parents or the lady who helps with house-chores might have thrown it away. That was the only proof of that moment that I had so I can’t blame you if you don’t believe me and it’s totally comprehensible. My family is the skeptical type and don’t really believe in supernatural beings, while I on the other hand am a believer since I’ve had my fair share of small experiences. 

So what are your thoughts on this? Or have you experienced something similar?"
t3_ehdaxh,all_ads,Are you gay,Thetruthishere,"""Are you gay"" the voice says. It sounds like a middle-aged woman."
t3_egx227,all_ads,I've always been fascinated with Near Death Experience accounts. Found this gem...,Thetruthishere,"On the 15th July 2013, at about 7.45am, I was on my way to work and approaching the intersection and getting ready to take a left-hand turn. This is a notoriously dangerous intersection on any day, and there have been many accidents there. It is hard to see if the intersection is clear from the right and the left turn is particularly hazardous. I was running late and in a flustered state of mind. I had an important meeting that I’d been planning for carefully over a number of days, and a really stupid delay at the last minute put all of that in jeopardy. It should also be understood that a much better traffic signal system exists there today than was in place at the time of this incident.

I approached the intersection in a hurry. I looked to the right and believed that I had correctly viewed that nothing was approaching from the right, so I made the left turn. As I crossed the intersection, I glanced right once more and saw a vehicle heading straight for me at what could only have been in excess of ninety miles per hour. We saw each other. I saw the look in the other guy’s eyes because we were that close. A collision was absolutely inevitable. There is no way on this earth that it could have been avoided.

What happens next is EXTREMELY difficult to describe, but I will do my best. And this can be (and must be) taken to apply to everything that I am going to attempt to relate from this point onwards. Words, even the most carefully chosen words, capture no more than 1% of this experience at best, and even then very poorly. This is quite possibly the most frustrating thing about giving this account.

Across from the front of the car on the left, in almost the opposite direction to the oncoming vehicle, was a field. I suddenly became aware of a very large 'object' approaching slowly on a diagonal across this field. It was coming directly towards my car. Time was not functioning normally while this was happening, if it was functioning at all. I had the space to notice this happening, but I can’t explain how I was able to do that. The object when I first saw it, appeared to be about the size of a ten-floor tower block. It subjectively seemed to be about two or three hundred yards across the field. These size and distance descriptions are meaningless, as I’ll try to explain in a moment.

The object resembled a giant waterwheel lying on its side and rotating as it approached me and my vehicle. As it got closer, this didn’t take time, as we understand it. I saw that my first observation about its size was wildly inaccurate. It was more like the size of a small city. As it got closer still, I understood that all scale and distance estimates were meaningless. It was larger than what we think of as the world. As it approached me, I became aware of its power and significance. My mind interpreted this as being an up-close, giant-scale physical object.

Okay, now this part is particularly difficult to explain. As the object drew near to me, a kind of sensation came over my person and I knew exactly what this thing was. Not only that, but I knew everything that pertained to it, what it was, what it was doing, what it’s 'business' was with me, where and when I had seen it before, why I was seeing it now, and many many other things that I cannot now recall.

I had seen the object before I was born and I will see it again when I die. We all knew it before we were born. We will all see it when we die. But this information is eclipsed from us while we are alive. And that was why I was seeing it now in the experience, because I was in the process of dying in a fatal car crash.

Here’s what I can remember, as best it words can tell. This wheel wasn’t something that moved towards me through the world, or through reality somehow. That was an illusion that my senses were constructing for me. The wheel WAS reality, itself. It represented EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSSIBILITY for a life or for a world that could ever be envisioned or imagined. As it approached, I became aware that what we call our world was contained within it. It was simply one of the numberless slots or paddles in the 'water wheel.' It had always been so. My life, your life, our world, all of us - we were a part of this wheel structure and we had always been a part of this structure. It simply now made itself visible to me.

There then began the truly terrifying dimension of this experience. Words cannot even begin to describe the level of fear I experienced. The water wheel sort of rolled across me and then across the place where my car was in the road. As it did so, I began to be hit by each of the paddles in the wheel.

Remember that all of this is just a way of talking. It does not, and cannot, remotely describe the real situation as it actually was.

But some sense of it can be had by imagining that in the space of each 'paddle' there was a kind of spinning film of water, like a waterfall on its side. Imagine a film of water being thrown outward from the wheel in each slot, as if by centrifugal force. Imagine being slapped or splashed by each of these films as you collide with it and pass through it to the next one. This is what was happening. Except these weren’t just films of water. They were (for want of a better term) possible realities or what we might think of as universes or worlds. Again, our world, our entire universe as we normally think of it, was simply one among an infinite number of these. How did I know that there was an infinite number? I just did. A kind of knowing came with the event, and there was no doubting this knowing. It WAS so, and I knew it was so.

And because I had knowledge and understood what was happening in ways I can no longer communicate, I was afraid. I understood that I was about to be subject to the process that humans approximated with the term 'reincarnation.' This was why the wheel had come. I represented a kind of discrepancy that had to be fixed. The event, or perhaps the imminent event, on the highway had caused me to slip out of or fall between the paddles on the wheel. This structure had some kind of cosmic purpose of sorting things into their correct natural place. I was afraid and resisted being 'sorted' so the wheel stepped up its aggressive attempts to 'sort' me correctly.

With this came another understanding that frightened me even more. I knew that unless I soon selected one of these realities to slide back into, that the wheel would coerce the situation by deciding for me. One way or another, I WOULD be 'sorted' whether I liked it or not. If I didn’t choose for myself, I would simply be fitted into place at some nearest position on the wheel to the point where I failed to make the decision; if that makes sense. I was aware of having a limited ability to choose, but not much. Even that limited ability wasn’t much use because each reality slammed against me and through me before I could make much sense of what it contained.

Even I did not remain the same from one slot in the wheel to the next. It was as if when each film broke over me, I was destroyed and made again from the ground up as a completely new self. There was no continuous 'me' that traveled unaltered through that wheel and can somehow report back on this experience. This is just one of the many things that is so very hard to explain. The very idea of a continuous self was contradicted by this experience.

I have forgotten, or perhaps it was deliberately suppressed, the vast majority of what I saw in the various universes or paddles of the wheel. At the beginning, they seemed very similar to this world we inhabit, or believe ourselves to inhabit. For example, I have a floating memory of seeing various different scenarios of how the accident played out. I suspect that these were all nearby paddles on the wheel. In one of them I remember seeing what looked like my vehicle thrown right off the road and so badly damaged that it looked like it had been folded in the center like a pocket knife. I seemed to recall many other scenarios like this that I can no longer remember. To clarify: what I mean is that I seemed to file or flip through numerous conceivable (quantum?) possibilities for the outcome of the accident. I can remember doing this, but I cannot remember what any of these particular 'worlds' contained.

I have no explanation for why I failed to experience any of the phenomena usually reported with the imminent death situations like the tunnel, the light, and so on. I suspect that imminent death experiences are symbolic scenarios that flash up just as someone is entering or exiting the wheel, but before the situation has developed very far. At no stage did I see anything whatever that resembled what we humans would think of as an afterlife or spirit world or life after death realm. It’s as if we are either on the outer surface of the wheel itself, in one of its realized worlds, or else we are dead and we are the wheel itself. The wheel is a space where all uncreated possibility exists, but nothing completed or actual. And bear in mind that nothing was concealed from me. I was the ALL, and knew the ALL. I certainly don’t retain it or pretend do, but I knew it then.

I began to grow extremely panicked. Each time I thought I was just beginning to get a handle on things, I would be slapped over violently and ruthlessly into a new slot in the wheel and a whole new 'me' would crystallize, along with all the memories and assumptions that went along with that world. I remembered none of who I was just a moment ago in another paddle on the wheel. I had no memory whatsoever of where I had come from or the highway situation in my world. I had zero memory of that world. I knew I had come from a 'somewhere' but had no recollection of where that was, or even who I was. It was about the most bizarre thing that you could imagine.

Somehow though, and I can only assume that it happened without any conscious action on my part, the possibilities appearing in the wheel began to narrow down and become somewhat more familiar again. Scenarios associated with the accident began to appear once more. I say once more, but I have no real way of knowing whether this was a separate incidence of this to what I described above, or whether it was really the same incidence because time was functioning so unusually during the whole episode.

Again I saw, or seemed to see, variations or possible world-outcomes where I died in the crash. I seemed to understand intuitively that if I went 'into' any of these, I would be there for only a few moments or minutes at most, and then I would have to come out and face the wheel again almost immediately. I didn’t want to do this. But there was an odd kind of knowing associated with that too. The wheel didn’t seem bothered one way or the other. It didn’t seem to matter to it whether I emerged again in three minutes time or three decades time. All it cared about was sorting me, and there was a kind of ruthlessness to this that I will not soon forget.

I found myself back on the highway in what seemed to be a very short distance back up the road, still approaching the intersection. This is just one of the many mysteries associated with the event that I cannot explain. Did I choose a world which was a version of our universe in which the accident hadn’t quite happened yet, but was just seconds away from happening? I can’t say, because I have no memory of making that decision. I remember the look on that driver’s face as clearly as if it were yesterday. I remember him bracing back on the wheel. But I braked as I reached the intersection and that driver, or his car, were simply nowhere to be seen.

t3_eguoal,all_ads,The time me and my friend were tormented in her own home,Thetruthishere,"This happened about a year ago when I was 16 at my friend's house  


  It was me and my friend, ""T's"" house while her family was out so it was just us. Her house wasn't quite in the middle of nowhere but it was close to it. At the time of this encounter it was around midday. Now, this house has always been haunted. I've had strange things happen to me since the day I first visited her there. To put into perspective for the story, her bedroom is on the second floor but the second floor is he room. Theres a little space at the top of the stairs for the balcony door on the right and her bedroom door on the left. i could touch both at the same time if i spread my arms. theres nothing else up there.  


 We were downstairs in her living room watching tv, eating snacks and such as usual. Now, I hadn't said anything to her because I didn't want to look crazy but I felt...unwelcome? If that makes sense. I felt like the longer we were down there the heavier the feeling got. So I suggested we go back up to her room. I took our cups and went into the kitchen to wash them. Out of the corner of my eye I see a dark hunched over figure run past me and into the laundry room. I thought it  was T so i turned around and audibly called out her name. She came in from the living room and asked what was up. I looked at her confused and asked if she had been in here. She seemed confused as well and said she hadn't been in here she had been fixing the recliners. I told her what I had seen and her face just dropped. It felt like one of those horror movie moments where you realize it was never your friend at all. We were spooked at this point and got out of dodge, running upstairs to her room. We thought it would be over but It was far from that.    


Now, T has a cat who HATES people. You can't pet her, go near her, anything. She's never even in the same room as us when i'm over. Upon settling on T's bed and talking about what we saw downstairs the cat began scratching on the door. So, we let her in and she bolts in with her hair raised and scrambles under the bed. Neither of us have ever seen that cat so afraid. This is when I stopped talking and I realized it sounded like somebody was walking around downstairs. I could hear bootsteps and whispering. Then, the cat wants to be let out. I didn't want to open the door because to be honest with you I was terrified at this point but T didn't want the cat to pee on her floor so she let her out. The cat got about halfway down the stairs when we hear her start to hiss and spit. The cat runs up the stairs, back into the bedroom and under the bed once again. This time I lock the bedroom door. A few minutes later T nudges me and says ""do you see that?"" I look over and theres a moving shadow under her door like somebody pacing back and forth. We were trying to distract ourselves until her parents got back from all the subtle noises but it wasn't really working. Suddenly we  hear a big BOOM from downstairs. We both flinch and we're like what the fuck was that then it happens again but louder it sounded like a door slam? or like something just ramming into the wall it was so loud that we thought somebody had broken in we can hear heavy boot steps and whispering downstairs we're certain somebody has just broken into T's house. So scared in fact that we got out her bat and barricaded her door. You might be wondering why we hadn't called the police if we thought there was a break in but honestly we weren't entirely certain.   


T's cellphone rings and it's her mom saying she's out front and to open the door cause her hands are full. Neither of us wanted to go downstairs but if her mom was there surely nothing had happened. We crept down the stairs, waiting to see a destroyed house or things in chaos but nothing. The doors and windows were locked and shut. Nobody was in the house. We let her mom in and that was that. We searched the house but there was genuinely nothing there.  This is the clearest paranormal encounter I have ever have had to this day."

There are several theories to understand these experiences, my favorite one is the usage of quantum entanglement and block universe model as a metaphor for the same.  
I am in my final year of my Psychology degree and was looking to talk to people who have has this same experience. I'm having trouble meeting people who have had this experience and are willing to talk about it.   
I would be so grateful if some of you are willing to do the same. Regardless thank you for reading my post."
t3_eh4czm,all_ads,Personal encounter with paranormal,Thetruthishere,"I’ve had 2 encounters with something that I genuinely couldn’t explain or rationalize in my life. The one I’m going to tell you about is something that I still to this day do not know the meaning of, but i feel it has changed my life. To begin, I have to explain my situation at the time. I was 17. I loved my life, had an excellent relationship with family, a wonderful girlfriend (whom I’d been very close with since 14) and excelled in school and at basketball. Every day after school I had a 2 hour break between school and practice, and every day I went to my girlfriends house. I am a VERY routine person, and I did the same thing every day. I drove to her house, parked in the same spot every day, and being a shy person I always texted her “I’m here” and waited for her to come to the front door before exiting my car and approaching. I’d ALWAYS wait to see her face through the window before walking up to the door. But This particular day I didn’t text and I didn’t wait. I parked, and got out of my car and just decided to go in. As I got closer to the house, maybe 40 feet or so, I glanced at the window, and I saw someone I didn’t recognize standing there. But part of me just thought it was her dad. So I avoided looking through the window, and just walked up to the door and entered. When I walked in, and looked where I had seen someone, nobody was there. So I decided it was nothing and to just go to my girlfriends room. But As I walked through the open living room I heard a noise behind me in the pantry. I stopped and turned around, expecting it to be my girlfriends dad grabbing a snack. But it wasnt. As I turned, I saw the pantry door closing, but before it closed. I clearly, 100% saw my own face and body before the door closed. It horrified me. I immediately turned and ran back to my girlfriends room and tried to explain to my girlfriend what had just happened. It took almost 10 minutes of my frantic and panicked explanation before she decided to go with me back to the pantry. But when we went nothing was there. I never saw anything like it again. That’s not to say whatever it was didn’t continue to affect me. I started to have dreams about fighting that version myself, of it hunting me and chasing me down her hallway. Truthfully I didn’t think it meant anything at the time and eventually I kind of put it in the back of my mind and didn’t think about it. 2 years after that happened, shortly after graduating, my girlfriend and I went to watch Us. A movie I didn’t know was about an evil version of yourself trying to hunt you. I had a panic attack in the theater. I got up and left and went to my car. My girlfriend finished the movie, which had about 20 minutes left, and met me in my car after.  We never talked about why I left the theater because we didn’t have time to. immediately upon getting in the car, My girlfriend told me she could do it anymore and I wasn’t the same guy she’d fell for. I was devastated. I don’t know if it’s coping, Or what, but I feel like what I saw is out to get me. After the breakup, for the last year, the dreams are back. I have them at least weekly. An unspeaking, but sinister version of my self chasing me through my ex girlfriends house trying to kill me. Trying to get rid of me. I am no longer in a good place mentally, and I feel like on top of the breakup, this version of me is tormenting me, pushing me to the brink. I do not know why. I don’t know how. I just know it’s very real and haunting."
t3_eh2wfb,all_ads,Huge Phantom Marching Band.... (true story),Thetruthishere,"This is a weird 'paranormal' occurrence that happened to me when I was in my early teens. I put paranormal in speech marks because maybe there is a rational explanation? I was in a rural area staying by my grandmother many years ago. Till this day she has a small villa on a mountain side. Below and above her are more villas and houses, so its far from being a remote place.




 Anyway, one night just after I had tucked in and still wide awake, I heard a marching band with lots of drums playing in the distance. It was like 10 pm in a rural area... so I was already like 'Nope. This can't be normal'. I then assumed that maybe its just one of our neighbors far below near the foot of the mountain deciding to have a party, despite the music not being the type you would play at a party. Plus at 10pm on a week night? 


Then it got weird. The music began to get louder as if it was coming up the mountain, rapidly approaching our place at a tremendous speed, so it definitely was not merely someone turning the volume up in their home down below. 



Soon the noise of the drums was right outside my bedroom window and then it stopped. This event was no longer than 30 seconds if I remember correctly. I jumped out of bed, asked my gran if she heard anything, but she was on the other side of the villa so said no. Although she should have regardless. But she believed me.



Now a marching band cannot climb a mountain and play music. And even if they used the one road on that mountain, they couldn't reach that speed. If there is a paranormal explanation I am guessing djinn band practice? lol.  BTW I was wide awake, and so didn't dream the occurrence. It also wasn't even remotely scary... just really strange, and somewhat exciting lol.



EDIT: I looked out the window after the music stopped. Nothing there. And whatever it was, it would have had to cross the fence onto my gran's private property while not missing a beat. It all happened so fast, that I didn't have time to jump out of bed and run to the window while it was going on... although thinking back, I am not sure if I would have wanted to see who or what was was playing that music anyway."
t3_egxnu1,all_ads,Things that go bump in the mine. Part 3.,Thetruthishere,"I'm sorry to report that a 21 year old miner was killed on a beltline on the 23rd of December at my former mine. If you could pray for his family, or at least send some positive vibes toward his family it would be appreciated. 

This incident was quite different from my encounter with the shadowy visitor. This encounter was also unique because I had a coworker directly beside me who also confirmed everyrthing I saw. 

My coworker I'll refer to as ""Luke"" from here out. Luke was an extremely intelligent former military man with a razor sharp wit. Guy was downright hilarious and I always enjoyed working with him. Like many other guys I've had the privledge of working with, Luke was a hardworking, honest man who took his commitment to work and family seriously. 

We were doing something called a ""power move"" in an active coal mining section. To the non-mining folk out there I will try to elaborate. Imagine that you are vacuuming your carpet. It is a large room and your power cable cannot reach all of the way to the other side of the room, so you grab an extension cord to finish the carpet. 

When coal mining, almost all of our equipment is ran by high voltage. The machines have a heavy cable that powers it and connects to a large metal box called a ""load center"", or ""power center"". A giant cable runs into the section, called a ""high line"" to the load center, and then all of the machines are plugged into the load center like a giant power strip. It supplies 12,470 volts to the section, and I don't even remember how many amps. Enough to blow softball sized holes out of the unlucky soul who makes a giant mistake and touches something they shouldn't. After removing all of the coal that the machines can reach with the supplied cable, we add a length of cable to the high line, move the load center further into the section, and then the machines can now reach fresh coal to mine. During a power move, more beltline is added to allow transport of the mined coal, and walls have to be built to control the ventilation within the mining section. Then the cycle repeats. This occurs in what is called a ""gate section"", while ""longwall section"" is a different cycle. I didn't intend for this to be a lesson in coal mining, but I digress. 

Luke and I were tapped to build the walls that control ventilation. It's a crappy way to spend the shift, but ventilation is crucial in a coal mine. We had the block in place, and now we were required to apply the sealant that is called ""mud"". It is a dry powder that comes in bags that must be mixed with water to make a brown thick liquid that can be spread over the surface of the block and fill in any gaps in the wall to make as close to an airtight seal as possible. It's messy, stinky, fibrous stuff that is dangerous to breathe, causes chemical burns to bare skin, ruins clothes, and has to be shoved and spread into every nook and cranny in a block wall that is fitted into uneven floor, walls and roof. The block was somewhere around 45 pounds a pop, and you had to use quite a bit of them. Area was 16 feet wide, and about 10 feet high. It was a pain in the ass. 

Gosh, sorry for the long lead in. Luke and I had humped all of the block in place from the pallets and it was mud time. Problem was that the beltman had our water supply cut off to extend the water lines. Our boss told us that were were not permitted to leave the mine until the wall was finished. Without proper ventilation, coal could not be mined. Coal pays our wage. Coal pays the bills. Problem is, no water, no mud, no wall. The beltmen would not have the water ready until the relief shift had arrived. Different bosses, different orders. 

During the shift I had noticed large pools of water had collected in the ""return"" entry. I told Luke that I knew where usable water was, and we could grab some buckets and collect water there to mix the mud. We needed water, didn't have to be clean water. We were kneeling down collecting water from a large puddle when I saw a miner walking toward us. It was late in the shift, so I assumed it was the fireboss on his inspection. Luke saw him as well. I noticed his caplight was unusually dim. It happens. Most miners carry a backup caplight for this contingency since batteries wear out over the lifetime of the caplight. I distinctly remember his reflective clothing we are all required to wear. He was walking toward us as we were looking down filling our buckets with water. When I looked back up, he was completely gone. Vanished completely. I half yelled to Luke "" where the fuck did he go""? I recall him looking all around us, realizing that there is literally nowhere for him to escape to, then looking back at me. He opened and closed his mouth a few times as if to offer an explanation and realized there wasn't any. Gone. 

We finished the wall somewhat late that shift, and this experience became a talking point between us. After discussing several things we had seen, it became apparent to me that he had experienced the shadow entity I had, only not as closely, and I had met another person who I could confide in what I was seeing without being ridiculed. 

Some men worked entire underground careers without experiencing anything unexplainable. Others, like myself, Luke, and others saw things that shook men to the core."

t3_egndh5,all_ads,My family and I got caught in a time-warp.,Thetruthishere," Some years ago-I’d say 2014/2015-my sis and I were scouring all hiking trails in San Jose and one afternoon decided upon a small but semi-reputable sounding one. We parked after surviving a badly made 1-way road, and started out with our dog around 3-3:30. The trail markers weren’t in great condition but we still easily found a main path to a scenic overview.

 It was a 20-30 minute hike which curved gently around a giant rock and relatively straightforward. We got to the overlook, admiring views of a dam and town for a good minute before turning around to start back. 

We turned around, and it was as if the straightforward trail we’d just been on had vanished and there was only one to the left going up and one to the right, going down. At first we thought “okaaay, this is weird, but let’s just get back.” Tried the path going up and around a hill, didn’t seem right. At this point I said “well, the gates close in 45 minutes, we have time if we can connect back with the trail we took.” So we went back to the one heading down, and somehow kept going further down the mountain when it should’ve joined with the main one. 

We knew something was wrong when the direction wasn’t changing and it was getting dark. So keep in mind that we parked at 3ish, got to the overlook at 4, and by 6-6:30 were lost. Thank everything I’d brought my mobile charger and there was a clear spot with reception halfway up the trail we were on and at the top where it intersected. I had to call 911 who had to call the park service to get someone to pick us up(the listed park’s emergency numbers were useless). 

Once we were rescued, it was a good 15 minute drive back to the lot. Now had the main trot been that long, we never would’ve made it to the scenic overlook with the sun still up. A 20-30 minute walk on an obvious main trail with plenty of light still, and we ended up needing a drive back that would’ve taken us 2 hours to walk. Not to mention my sis’s dog who is typically very good with knowing where to go, was frightened and confused. 

We are convinced we got caught in a vortex or timewarp of some kind because we can’t explain how a fairly short walk put us hours away from the car."

t3_egueeo,all_ads,"Has anyone else experienced an ""electric voice?""",Thetruthishere,"I wonder if others have experienced a disembodied voice talking to them, specifically one that sounds electric with static (like coming from a radio or walkie talkie).  

Years ago, I worked alone in a big office.  Staring at a computer screen all day, I preferred dim lighting in my work environment, so I kept the flourescent lights off and used the natural lighting coming in through the windows.  One day, the janitor came in, emptying trash cans.  

He took a break at my desk and started telling me about the building.  ""This place used to be a jail, and your office used to be a holding cell.  Someone hanged himself in here, so there's something in here.""  He then went on to tell me about a black, smokey shadow that other janitors see at 4 in the morning.  The things he told me made me nervous, but I decided not to let it bother me.  

The day after he told me, I heard it.  It was mid-morning, and I was busy at my desk, lights off as usual.  From behind me, it sounded like someone spoke through a walkie talkie.  I distinctly heard a static-ey shh sound right before and after the word came.  Someone said, ""hey.""  The voice sounded like someone who had a bad cold who couldn't breathe through their nose.  It made me wonder about all those horror movie demons with deep voices.  

I looked around the room where the voice spoke.  I saw nothing.  I was like...what should I do?  Do I say hi back?  What if it wants to have a conversation?  Screw that!  Then I got up and went to my coworker's office.  I told him what just happened, and he told me he experienced the same thing.  In his case, he was working alone in the building, and as he was walking out to leave, a voice from right behind him said, ""hey.""  He booked it out as fast as he could.  

Part of me thinks the janitor was messing with me.  I pictured him hiding a walkie talkie in my office.  Nonetheless, a prankster janitor doesn't explain my coworker's experience.  

Has anyone else experienced such a voice talking to them?  Did you notice the static, electric feel to it?  What about the stuffy nose effect?"
t3_egmipf,all_ads,I feel strange and uneasy without my grandfather clock,Thetruthishere,"Disclaimer: This may be nothing, but I feel weird enough to post it because this thing I’m currently experiencing is very strange to me.

Years ago, when I was around 13/14 years old, my dad bought me a grandfather clock. 

The clock came from an estate sale. We didn’t usually go to estate sales, but a lady in the neighborhood had died and we decided to check out the sale and see the house. 

The clock was in the foyer, and for some reason I was instantly drawn to it. I don’t know why, but I *had* to have it. My dad first said no because it was very expensive, but I begged him for it and he was able to negotiate the price down a good bit and we took it home!

We put it in our living room and I always enjoyed looking at it and hearing the slow, quiet ticking.

Years passed, I went off to college. 
My dad died suddenly when I was 19. I am 25 now and have had the clock in my own house since graduating.

I am now getting ready to move to a new city. I have packed up most of the house. One of the last things I did was prepare the clock to be moved. (To move a grandfather clock you have to remove the pendulum and weights, secure the metal cables, and tape down certain parts in the mechanism).

Just as soon as the clock parts were packed up, my house suddenly didn’t feel like home anymore. It doesn’t seem to have the same happy energy I always felt in it. I miss the soft sounds and motions of the clock. The clock just looks blank and lifeless now and the house feels dead, maybe even a little spooky.

I feel this even as I type this from the master bedroom. The clock is in my foyer, even if it were running I wouldn’t be able to hear it from here. But I still *feel* that it’s not running.

It’s like the clock was a beacon of good energy, but I didn’t realize it until it was missing. I can tell you one of the first things I will do in my new house is reassemble the clock and start it back up.

To add an additional, peculiar thought: the clock was made by a company called Ridgeway. Their company slogan is “The Heartbeat of the Home”."

t3_egjqp0,all_ads,Bizarre Dream after Stepdad's Death,Thetruthishere,"I found this sub not too long ago and thought it might be the perfect place to post this. I've wanted to write it down several times now, just so I won't forget it, but I don't think I'll ever forget this dream. This happened about 4 years ago. 

So my stepdad was diagnosed with lung cancer about five years ago and he went through the whole ""fighting the cancer"" ""battling"" and he was completely committed to beating it. He was only 47 years old. Throughout the next year, things continually got worse. They found tumors all over his liver and intestines. He knew he was going to die but he was completely not ready to accept it. One of our favorite things that we use to do was go hiking and find a nice place to smoke a dooby. After a year of fighting the cancer, it took him.

About two weeks after his death, I had the strangest, most memorable dream. We were all hiking. My mom, my stepdad, and my former girlfriend. We got to this lonnnggggg bridge that was suspended high in the air in the woods. When we approached the bridge there were two guards who would only let my stepdad pass. He told us he was going to cross and check out what was over on the other side. When he came back he was filled with excitement and told us about this massive lake with a large stone in the center of it. The way he described it in the dream was amazingly beautiful. The bridge and the woods were also beautiful, with mists and fogs hanging everywhere. He finally told us that he was going to go there and that we could come later. Because he was the only one allowed to cross. I remember my mom being very sad in the dream as well. We were all sad. I remember looking back and he was looking back at us waving as he crossed the bridge. 

Everytime I think about this dream, it overwhelms me because I've never had anything else like this happen in my entire life. It's the only dream that sticks with me."
t3_egis6f,all_ads,I don't wanna live here anymore,Thetruthishere,"So I have lived in my house for around five years now. When I first moved in everything seemed fine.

I was hopeful that the experience in this home and neighborhood would be better than in my last home.

This encounter occurred a few months ago so please forgive me if it reads a little disjointedly.

Okay, here we go...

One day I was left home alone, while my mom and siblings went up north to visit my cousins. I was on the second floor cleaning my room, listening to music, pretty normal stuff. I am going about my business when I hear a loud bang and what sounds like footsteps walking on the first floor. Naturally, I figured my family had come home, which would have been weird since my family had been gone for about an hour and a half, and the drive to my cousins was about an hour. I walked out of my room, over to the railing that overlooks the living room and kitchen. I called out to my mom. I received no response so I called out a few more times. With no response, I went back to cleaning figuring I was just hearing things. I was cleaning for a few minutes before I heard some shuffling and footsteps downstairs. At this point, I was freaking out just a little bit. I feared someone had broken into my house. I couldn't remember if I had locked the front door.

I grabbed my phone and left my room. I started video recording as I walked down the stairs calling out to whoever could be there. I walked around the first floor and found nothing. I stood in the kitchen, everything in its place, and waited before I heard a door slam shut and footsteps on the second floor. I walked back towards the front door noticing it was still closed, and locked, but the basement door, which had been open, was shut. I opened the front door and then the glass storm door.

Now a quick side note. The storm door is really heavy, you also have to push or pull it in order for it to close properly.

I was sitting outside, petting my cat and calling my mom asking her if she could come home because something was going on. She told me that she and my siblings would come home. I hung up and continued to sit on the porch, figuring it would be the safest place to be. As I'm sitting there my cat looks up suddenly, her ears pulled back. she was looking behind me at the door when I hear it. The glass door makes this loud noise. the sound it makes when it is pulled closed. I immediately got up and went back inside, in retrospect, it was not the smartest decision. I sprinted into the office, which is next to the front door. I grabbed the house phone and my cellphone. I called my mom again and prepared the house phone to call 911. I hid out of sight all the while I could hear things being shifted around, footsteps, and loud banging sounds coming from all around my house. This went on for around an hour longer, having already been happening for four hours before that. When my mom got home we all started searching the house. I was upstairs while my mom and siblings searched the basement. I heard three of them come back upstairs and walk to the kitchen. I was then called downstairs. when I got to the kitchen my mom asked me if I had moved anything in the kitchen. I said no because I had only been in the kitchen once since being home alone. Everything in our kitchen had been moved around and arranged on the middle island. Somethings were stacked on top of each other and pulled away from the wall.

I had no explanation for this.

we knew at this point that it couldn't have been an actual person since no windows were broken and all the doors leading to the outside were locked.

we went to the backyard to search around the house when we noticed something else.

Under our back porch in a gated area for pool stuff and outdoor equipment. it takes a lot of force to open the gate, more often than not requiring more than one person to open it. The porch door was wide open. So we all went back inside, checked all the locks, and kept most of the lights on for the rest of the night.

it is truly one of the scariest things I have ever experienced."

t3_eg81yg,all_ads,Have you ever felt like a house or building was just... bad?,Thetruthishere,"Just discovered this sub and it instantly made me think of this particular house.

I live in a small town in South Carolina that is famous for its historic mansions and large estates. I’m friends with a lot of people who live in these houses and they’re all beautiful and all have happy vibes.

Except one. This one house has always given me bad feelings. My ex-girlfriend used to babysit for the family who lives there and looked after the dogs when they were out of town. She hated to be in the house alone, and usually called me to go with her when she had to.

Nothing about the way this house looks is creepy. It’s a beautiful 1920s white house with big two-story front porch columns and dormer windows. Probably around 7,000 square feet. Also with stables and a carriage house over to one side. It’s been recently renovated top-to-bottom with high-end, designer everything. It also has big windows, so it’s full of natural light.

When you’re in the driveway, looking at the house, you feel fine, totally normal. As soon as you step into the house, you get this intense, dark feeling. You don’t feel a presence, but you just have this uncomfortable feeling that makes you want to get out. It’s like you can sense evil.

One time we had to feed the dogs and we had two friends with us. We didn’t tell them about the weird feelings we got from the house. All four of us went inside. We were all somewhat uneasy. We gave them a full tour of the house and we all came upon the same word: *heavy*. We thought the atmosphere in the house seemed heavy.

I’ve done all the research I can, and it doesn’t seem like anything remarkable or bad has ever happened at that house. For whatever reason, it just feels like an evil house. The feeling goes away as soon as you’re outside the house. It’s like it’s a relief to leave."

I think most of the stories are fictional and were posted to r/nosleep, but it reminded me of something that happened to me when I was in college so I'm going to try posting it here in case anyone has anything to share. I tried not to think too much of it at the time, but I did make a brief blog post with a photo which I was able to go back and find. I'm so glad, because otherwise I would doubt my own sanity.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my story that goes with it: 

I had just moved into the 3rd floor of an apartment building which was at the bottom of a very steep hill. From my bedroom window, I could see an old wooden staircase through the trees. It wasn’t easy to access and there was nothing behind the apartment except for the hill, which began only a few feet away from the back of the building. 

It looked like the kind of steps you’d see on a nature trail, except they started several feet up the bank of the hill with no easy way to get there besides climbing. So I did. I slipped and fell at least once and had to grab on to little tree trunks to keep my footing as I made my way up. I probably should’ve done it on a nice, sunny day but my curiosity got the better of me and this town wasn’t known for having lovely weather. 

I got to the staircase, walked up it with ease, and once I reached the top I looked around for any evidence of its original purpose. I expected to find a hidden picnic area or an overgrown nature trail, something that would make sense. There was nothing, and also nowhere for anything to be. The hill just kept going without leveling off. So I kicked the leaves around a little bit, thinking that maybe there were more stairs. I found nothing, so I gave up.

After coming home, I did a brief search for nature trails in the area and tried to look at old aerial views to see if I could see anything. None of this yielded any theories that I can recall, but I do remember not being able to find the staircase on the maps either. I thought this could be explained by the leaves being in the way of an aerial view, especially in the older photos which weren’t as clear. 

When I went to drop off the rent that month I asked the apartment manager if she knew why there were stairs in the woods behind the apartment. Her response was, “What stairs?” I asked her if there had ever been anything up there and she said no. There was a house a lot further up the hill, but it was nowhere near the stairs. 

A few weeks or months later, I drove my roommate to the ATM and noticed a set of steps on the hill by the bank. There must have been a building there at some point but now it was gone. I asked my roommate if he knew anything about the “mystery stairs” behind our apartment and wasn’t surprised to find out that he hadn’t noticed. He never paid much attention to anything that wasn’t a video game. When we went home, I tried to show him the stairs from my bedroom window but I couldn’t see them. We couldn’t see them from his window either, so I decided to go back outside to look again.

I walked around the back corner, looked up the hill and was confused when I didn’t see the stairs. Since they had been in the woods, I figured they must have gotten covered up by leaves or debris, but knew that explanation didn’t really make sense. Not enough time had passed for there to be absolutely no trace of them.

“Let me know when you find it,” my roommate said as he rolled his eyes, “I’m going back inside.”

I never found it, and to this day I have no logical explanation for where it possibly could’ve gone. Perhaps it was a temporary installation by an art student, but I was also an art student so I feel like I probably would’ve heard about it. Plus it looked like it had been there for years, and left no evidence behind. I think I would’ve noticed if someone removed it. Seems like it would’ve taken quite a bit of work and at least one full afternoon, and then I would think there’d be at least a little bit of evidence left behind, but I’ve never had to build a staircase into a hillside so maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about. 

My only other theory is kind of embarrassing, but probably fitting for the “creepy stairs in the woods” genre even though I don’t think it existed at the time: What if the staircase was actually a portal to another dimension, one that ironically didn’t have a staircase?? In retrospect, I totally should’ve taken an “after” photo of the woods from my window, but my approach was more along the lines of, “This is creepy and kind of insane so I’m just going to pretend it never happened.” 

I still don’t want to believe in this sort of thing as a possibility because it freaks me out (and also really interests me somehow) but I’m completely lacking when it comes to a more practical explanation, so if anyone would like to offer one I’m open to your theories. For the sake of reddit anonymity, I don't want to say which town it was even if that detracts from my credibility.

\*\*TLDR; About 15 years ago I found a set of stairs in the woods behind my apartment. I walked up them, and then they disappeared forever.\*\*"
t3_eg8iyf,all_ads,Taiwan ghost child?,Thetruthishere,"So, I've lived in Taiwan for over a decade now. Taiwan is heavily Taoist and place a huge emphasis on respecting (and fearing) the dead. When I first moved here, I located a nice 3 bedroom apartment in a nice area of town for a very reasonable price. The third bedroom was down a short hall adjacent the family room and had a window that opened to the building draft shaft..which pretty much just spewed cockroaches and was pitch black all the time. The room always sort of creeped me out and I didn't know why. When I'd sit at the computer, the room was on my left and I could always see it out of the corner of my eye. Well, one night the light just flips on in there. Thought that was weird, but I couldn't tell if the switched had physically flipped or not because I didn't know the location of off on it due to the shape. Fast forward a month and I decided to get a ""mini"" pig....which turned out to be a massive 200lbs sow which I still have. I took her for walks every day down to the local park and let her graze while I studied Chinese. One day some very friendly, but very odd old woman came up to me giving me the Chinese gesture of service (hand on a fist in front of you as you bow) and rambled on to me in Chinese about what I couldn't understand at the time. I smile, don't know what else to do. A week later, there she is again. She takes my Chinese text book and pencil. She goes to a blank page in the back and proceeds to draw something then write something in Chinese. She smiles politely and gives it back to me. The picture is what looks to be a doll of a girl in a dress with very large hole like black eyes. I'm sort of shocked and creeped out. The picture was quite well drawn by the way. I didn't know what it said, so I took it to my Chinese teacher. She takes one look at it and her face goes white. She says, ""there is a bedroom in your house with the ghost of a young girl in it. She likes you and your pig. She is friendly"". I kind of swallow hard. Back at home I look at a note on the door of the room that had been there since the day I moved in. I assumed it was saying something about the electrical in the room or something. I take it to my Chinese teacher the next week who unhappily tells me, ""that is the room the girl lives in"". I go home, tell the ""girl"" politely that I can't handle that sort of thing but her space is her space, then proceed to move a month later. Too creepy for me!"
t3_efwuno,all_ads,A Spirit Has Been Following Me Around For Many Years. I only found out about it recently,Thetruthishere,"I’ve always thought my new house is haunted ever since I first moved in last year. Things like books or glasses disappeared only to reappear in places I would never put them in. I still find missing cups or plates under my bed from time to time. My dog Joe is not a hoarder and he never touches anything he knows he’s not allowed to, so he’s not to blame. Sometimes I see things moving quick in my peripheral vision only to disappear as soon as I turn to take a better look. Unexpected and unexplained temperature change and weird sounds in the middle of the night. My dog also somehow seems afraid of the basement, he will never go down there no matter what and always barks at the door whenever he walks past it or just walks around the dining table to get as far as possible from it. 

One hot summer night, the electricity was off, I was sleeping when I felt a frozen cold hand squeezing my shoulder, jolting me awake with a start. I thought it was only a dream at first but then I touched my shoulder where the ghostly hand had been only a few seconds ago and it was still cold, compared with the rest of my body which was warm and sweaty. That’s when I was really convinced that my house was indeed haunted. But apart from those weird things, I have never seen any apparition or something far worse than just a ghostly hand groping me in the middle of the night. I’ve tried to co-exist with the ghost by acknowledging its presence with simple gestures like saying greetings each time I arrive home or say ‘see you’ before I leave. And it seems to work out well.

But a few weeks ago, something happened. I met this girl on Tinder and we agreed to hang out at my place. As soon as I opened the door for her, her face turned pale. I invited her in, but she told me she was sorry and it was not a good idea and then left abruptly. I was confused and really offended. I mean I know I am not the most good-looking guy on the planet but come on. I had sent her my photos earlier on Whats App and she seemed to have no problem with my face then. Then why all of a sudden she changed her mind as soon as she saw me in person. 

I dropped her a message asking if there’s something wrong and she told me that she didn’t want to offend my friend if we were going to have sex that night. I thought she was talking about Joe so I said “Come on. My dog won’t hate me just because I have a one-night stand. I know he’s a good Christian but using him for a subtle ugly-shaming is not cool. “

Then she said she was not talking about Joe, but the spirit in my house. I said “Oh you can see it?” and she said yes. I asked her what it looked like but she refused to elaborate and only told me that it’s a he. Then she asked me how long I have had it following me around, which I did not understand. She said she could tell that thing has been following me around for a long time, which is weird. I told her I have only been living there for a year. And she said the spirit has been with me long before I moved to that place.

We arranged another meet up met at a restaurant and she said it was still following me around. I called my mother the other day and asked if they had ever made a deal with a spirit or something and being a devout Christian, she and my father both, took offence and started scolding me. Does anybody know what kind of spirit is this? And why is it following me around?"
t3_efyr90,all_ads,I Think There Was Something In My Room,Thetruthishere,"My dog sleeps in the same room as me, she always has. She has a bed a few feet away from mine. She never wakes me up for anything, and the only noises she’s ever made at night is if she is dreaming, she is a very quiet dog.

This happened about 5 years ago. 
I had just set my phone down for the night, and said goodnight to my dog, she was still awake and it was maybe 1 in the morning. I roll over to my left side, facing my wall, with my dog, my closet, and my door all behind me. I’m maybe just a few moments away from falling asleep and I hear my dog let out the deepest, meanest growl I have ever heard. 

My heart starts racing and I immediately turn around to face my dog and the majority of my room. I don’t see anything in the room but I feel something, like I’m being watched. I see my dog is staring at something intensely right by my closet, which is about 7 feet to our right. She is holding her gaze there, and growls one more time for a few seconds. 

I am completely frozen and scared out of my mind. Several more moments go by and she very slowly swivels her head to the left, towards the door, as if she is following something, making sure it leaves. It was as if whatever was in the room got the hint and slowly backed out of the area without breaking eye contact with my dog. 

I do not know what she thought she saw, she was very much awake in the moments before this. This is one of only maybe a few times where I genuinely cannot explain what happened or what was going on. It was very weird."

t3_eg1929,all_ads,Reoccurring Childhood Dream,Thetruthishere,"First off, before even going into detail, is it odd to remember a dream from your early childhood...even if it was recurring? 

Anyway, I'm 25 now and this dream I had when I was a little kid has stuck with me and always kind of bothered me, just for the fact that even then, it creeped me out. My parents had just finished building the house I grew up in when I was born, so no previous owners and while the neighborhood was older (houses built during the oil boom in the 40s), there was never (to my knowledge) a house on this particular lot. 

Regardless, I used to have this recurring dream, maybe even more of a nightmare about 3 men (strangers) being in our basement. There was a french door in our basement that went outside and in the dream, the largest man was standing, leaning in the door way, another man was sitting in the door and the third was standing inside the basement. They all 3 worse bibbed overalls and little hats (exactly like the outfit George Clooney wears in Oh Brother, Where Art Thou). Unfortunately, I can't remember what they were talking about in the dream, but I vividly remember having this dream numerous times throughout my younger childhood. We moved when I was 6 and I don't recall ever having the dream again after that. 

My sister, who is 11 years older than me also swears to this day that she used to hear people talking in our basement when no one was down there. 

Not sure what I plan to get from posting, but I've never really talked about this to anyone else and after reading through some of the posts in this sub, I just felt the need to put one of my experiences out there."
t3_efjsov,all_ads,I think something is in my house.,Thetruthishere,"Some background: I'm 15, I live in a 2 room apartment at ground floor with my mom. While alone, i am paranoid that something is in my house. 

It started with hearing my shutters move at night, a sudden quiet ""tack"" sound every 10-15 seconds and it can last for as much as a minute.

Also, i was in the bathroom once and dropped the toilet seat on the toilet too hard then i heard something jump in the bathroom vent, half a second after i dropped the seat. 

When i was younger, i heard a loud clap in the air, above my body(i wasn't asleep yet) and when i looked around the room there was nothing. 

This might be just me having an irrational fear but i'm afraid it might be something more. More stuff has happened but I don't remember it right now."
t3_efi1c1,all_ads,Shadow people/ghost?,Thetruthishere,"This happened to me quite a few years ago I was probably 10 at the time (21 now) and I had been waiting outside by my mom's car because she went back inside to grab something. As I was standing there I decided to turn around and I saw standing in front of me was this black outline, like a solid shadow? Of a man. I couldn't make out any sort of details on his face or anything. He was standing there looking at me for a few seconds and then he slowly started to walk towards me. At that point I turned around and ran back inside the house."
t3_ef6vfi,all_ads,Have you ever been to a place that felt off? I went to a place like this and I still get shivers when I think about it to this day.,Thetruthishere,"This happened when I was a teen, I'm 26 years old now. This is important mentioning because after all those years, I still feel bad if I think about that day.

My parents decided to move and I went with them to look at some houses. The first two were ok, but not quite what my parents were looking for, since they wanted a house with a big backyard. The realtor decided to show them a newly vacant house, the owner was an old lady who had died and their sons decided to sell the house. 
My parents aren't superstitious or religious people (I'm also not) so we didn't see a problem with it.

We arrived at the place, the realtor opened it, we entered the garage, everything was fine. Until I went to the living room.
I almost let out a gasp because the atmosphere was SO OPPRESSIVE. Like there was invisible eyes everywhere observing and judging me. Felt like there was a weight on my chest, I couldn't even breath properly. I left the room and went to the backyard to catch some air when I saw a small room connected to the back of the house. I entered it out of curiosity and saw it was a small empty room with humidity stains on the walls. Just when I was about to enter the room to see if there was anything interesting, something just figuratively 'punched' my chest with SO MUCH sadness/anger I almost ran screaming. 
I slammed the door and entered the house again, going to one of the empty bedrooms and sitting on the floor, trying to catch my breath. 

I couldn't stay though, because the feeling of being watched/judged by numerous invisible eyes returned with even more intensity. At this point I left the house to find my parents talking with the realtor in the front garden. I grabbed my mom by her arm and begged her to go home. After some awkward excuses, my parents finally went home. 

I didn't say a word during the way back  but when I arrived home, I just cried and cried and cried for HOURS. My parents got concerned and asked me what was happening and i just kept repeating 'I don't know, I don't know I'm feeling so sad'. I felt like I would never be happy again ever. 

I still think about that day and I still get shivers. As I write this, the hair on my arms are standing up.
Last thing I heard about the house is that someone else bought it and turned it into a restaurant."

t3_efcuzk,all_ads,I Think I Saw the Future,Thetruthishere,"I’m not sure if this is exactly the right place for this, but I’ve seen all sorts of topics posted in this sub, so here we go. 

When I was young, maybe 8-9, I had a dream. The dream began with me walking along a wet dirt path covered in leaves. It smelled as though it had recently rained, the birds were chirping, and the sun was starting to peak out of the clouds again. Several moments pass as I wall along this path and I come to a set of red doors on the side of a matching red building. On the left doors sign said ‘KEEP OUT. STAFF ONLY’. The doors were padlocked, however in the dream I was able to open it somehow. When I opened the doors, I saw nothing. Just black, nothingness. I soon woke up. 

I remember having this dream, because it felt so incredibly real, I told both of my parents about it separately, just describing how real it felt and how odd it was. At that age I was still dreaming about being a Jedi or catching Pokémon, or showing up to school without pants. I had never had a dream like this.

Anyway, fast forward about 4-5 years, me and my family go on vacation. On day one of this vacation I am walking around the rec center in this resort, and I find myself on a wet dirt path. It smelled of rain, the birds were chirping, and the sun was just peaking back out of the clouds. And then I stopped. I don’t know why I stopped, but something made me stop. I turn to my right, and there it is. The same set of red doors, the same sign, the same text, the same padlock. I was so freaked out by this I kept walking, and I didn’t think about it again until recently.

Is there anything particular scary about this? No. But it was such a severe case of deja vu, I wasn’t sure how to react. To this day I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I’ve only ever met one other person with a similar experience. Have any of you experienced anything like this?"

I kept feeling a presence on the other side of the curtain (I did not feel afraid of it and it gave me no reason to be), and since the door makes a loud noise while opening it, I would have heard someone open it. The lines are also very thin and delicate as well as the whole thing being just weird. It's not the sort of thing my family would draw on the mirror as a prank, because it would take too much time and effort. It looks like a goat to me.

Any ideas what it might be or mean?"
t3_efdlxe,all_ads,My Dad’s Last Goodbye,Thetruthishere,"My dad passed away when i was 4 years old, two and a half weeks before my 5th birthday. Life has gone on, and it’s become more manageable, especially being that he said goodbye before he went. 
The morning after my dad passed away, my mom woke me up with tears in her eyes. Before she could even tell me what had happened, I told her i had a dream about dad. She said that i told her he came down, gave me a big hug and kiss, and went away. I am now 20 years old, and i still, VIVIDLY, remember the dream i had. 

I was wandering around in an airport. There were huge masses of people, and little 4 year old me was effortlessly weaving through the crowds. I kept looking up, trying to be “taller” so i could see. And finally, the crowds almost opened up like a walkway, and there he was. he was smiling so big, glowing almost, and i ran to him and jumped into his arms. he gave the big hug and kiss i was talking about, put me down, and said he’d see me soon and turned and disappeared into the crowd. I ran to a window and watched his “plane” take off. 

YEARS LATER, i was i think 17 when i found this out, but before my dad passed away (car accident) he asked his dad if he could move with him while he “got his shit together”. This would mean a move from Wisconsin to Georgia. My grandpa ended up saying no, which, when it all boils down to it, is why my dad was where he was when he was killed. I think my dad was showing me what he wanted to happen, how it could’ve been, and just that he loved me. 

if you have any other ideas of what he was trying to show or tell me, i’m all ears. this has happened to me with other relatives, but i’ll save those for another time, as they weren’t imprinted into my mind as strongly. it’s been sooo long that i’ve kept these to myself or between my mom and i, just to find out, i’m not the only one! also feel free to share stories in the comments, i wanna hear what others have experienced. i will post more if this gets good feedback."

Example:

One of my hobbies is running, and one day I went for a nightly run. I was at my city's park when all of sudden I felt uneasy and with a feeling of impending doom. I looked at my left and a woman was sitting on one of the park benches, staring at me.

She wasn't dressed weird or anything like that, physically she was just a normal woman in her 30s, but the instant I looked at her, my instincts kicked back and my whole body screamed GET. AWAY. She was dressed in a shirt and jeans, with a purse. Her hair was medium length and dirty blonde. Completely normal.

t3_efbh79,all_ads,A Floating Orb,Thetruthishere,"I recently came across this subreddit and want to share a story I have never told anyone before.

About 8 years ago, when I was 17,  I was standing outside in a circle of friends at my high-school. A few of us were just smoking cigs and talking bs. It was probably around November as I remember we were wearing our winter jackets but there was no snow on the ground. 

I remember my mind trailing off and I wasn’t paying attention to the conversation anymore. Then suddenly I had this intense weird feeling pass through my whole body. The best I can explain it is that it felt like guilt. It was this intense feeling of “guilt” (but not actually guilt?) I remember thinking I could feel my stomach lining and my blood and skin felt really really hot and Instantly started sweating under my jacket.

 At this point I think I forgot where I was and what I was doing, I was in a trance outside of reality. I was staring at the ground and had an intense urge to look up. I saw this floating orb right in-front of my face. It was kind  of dipping up and down, almost like a floating bubble. It was almost transparent looking but I could see a forest inside of it. It was like a winter wonderland forest. I could see a pathway through the snow and snow covered trees draping over it. 

I remember just staring at the orb and the forest inside of it, my mind almost completely blank not thinking anything. Then I got an intense rush of fear, looked away from the orb and felt like my body had physically stood up. 

I found myself still just standing in my circle of friends. None of them seemed to notice anything about me and the conversation was going on as normal. The weird guilt feeling was gone and I could feel my blood cool down and my sweat turn cold on my skin. 

I just played it cool like nothin happened but really I was kind of freaking out and very confused. Never mentioned it to my friends and didn’t want to google it or tell my parents as I was scared it was related to schizophrenia or something similar. 

I have never had anything like it happen since and I feel as if I have a completely healthy mind."
t3_ef7gbi,all_ads,We see ‘things’.,Thetruthishere,"Only just found this sub. Not sure if this is the right place but here goes. 

So I am in my mid 20’s now and nothing has happened like this for a while but approximately 10 years or so there was a lot of strange going’s on in my life and my mums for that matter. All this happened within the space of 2/3 years. 

So it all started with my mum waking up and seeing a figure of a little boy at the end of her bed, unthreatening but obviously alarming to see in the middle of the night but she said she did not feel sacred. The figure of a young boy apparently looked very similar to my older brother and then not so later a series of events happened and he moved out to another relatives home at 16. 

Then not so long after she was woken up in the middle of the night and saw a figure of an older woman in her bed next to her besides what was her husband/my dad at the time. On telling him he laughed it off but then so happened to leave not so long later as he had been having an affair with an older woman! 

After this we bought a dog, a young puppy, all seemed fine then one day we went to the cinema and on returning something strange happened. I stopped in the doorway and saw a light, somewhat like a spec of glitter or dust falling from the sky and just had a strange feeling, not so much bad but just different. I told my mum at the time who said it would have been nothing, a reflection of the light or something but then we noticed the dog we had didn’t come to greet us as he usually would and then discovered he had suffered a seizure and passed away. I still continue to see the same light/dot thing to this day and I have been to opticians and hospitals, I even went through laser eye surgery so I know my eyes are 20/20. 

After this my great grandad suffered a stroke and was in hospital, unfortunately he later ended up dying. We often went to visit him but as he was deteriorating he told my family (unbeknown to me at this time) he didn’t want me coming and seeing him like this anymore. Soon after I was asleep in my bed and a tall shadowy figure, resembling my great grandad lent over me on awaking in the night, I was not scared when I woke up, again it was a weird sensation, more shocked than anything. 

Not long after this my great grandma passed away and once again I woke up during the night to an elderly lady at the bottom of the bed. Once again I was shocked but this time I screamed out for my mum. She told me the next day that she was dreaming of my great grandma being on the phone to her and to tell her son (my grandad, my mums dad) that she was fine. My mum recalls she woke up feeling freezing cold like an eerie chill and when I said there was an old lady at the end of my bed it was even more strange. 

After this I hated going to bed. One night when I was sat there is said out loud to whatever ‘please don’t come anymore you are scaring me and I don’t like’ I also imagined a bubble of some sort protecting me as I slept and to this day I have had no more encounters. Although I do still see the strange light which reminds me of my dog from time to time. But still I have no answers to what went on over these few years, who knows what it was.

Let me start by saying I'm not religious and have no clue why this happened but have been curious for an answer ever since. When I was kid probably 10 or 11 I had came home from a funeral visitation. It was probably around 9pm at night, it was a dark yet clear night. Upon getting out of my father's car I started walking to up to our house. We lived in the country and it took a minute to walk up from the driveway to the house. Anyway, as I started walking I heard what sounded like ""Angelic"" singing very loudly coming from the sky. I couldn't make out the words but I know I heard it. I asked my dad if he heard it and he didn't hear anything but also didn't question me. I also used to hear voices at my grandma and grandpas whose house was literally next to my dad's. The voices always came from the upstairs 2nd story of the house and I could never make those words out either but never felt a sense of dread or fear.

Then all of a sudden, my body went stiff, my mouth slightly open and I could feel and sense a dark shadow in the corner of my eye. It was as if I could see it too. Shapeless...blackest blacks...I tried screaming, but nothing came out. I was screaming in my mind.


Strangely enough I snapped out of it and I wasn’t scared. It was just a weird occurrence."
t3_eewrpy,all_ads,Things that go bump in the coal mine. Part 2.1...Unknown intent.,Thetruthishere,"Following last post, I received some questions concerning what I saw, what I though it was, and what, if anything, I thought it wanted. I think I wanted to know these answers, but the truth may have been too much to handle. This thing creates intense feelings of doom. Whether it emits this intense emotion or it is a natural reaction to such an unnatural...thing, I don't know. 

This story concerns another encounter with this awful thing. I was working the same supposed cakewalk gig, at the same booster location. This thing was discussed between the man I relieved, myself, and the man who relieved me. We were all generally terrified of it. Some days we would notice it hanging around, just out of the light, making 10 hour shifts seem like an eternity of looking over our shoulders. Other days, it would be completely absent. The days it was absent weren't exactly the best either. It was almost as bad wondering where that fucking thing was than actually seeing it out there pacing, flitting about, or worse just watching us in our peripheral vision in the bare edge of the light. 

This shift I was on started like any usual. I attempted to mentally prep myself for another day of shoveling spilled coal while having the shit scared out of me for the next ten or so hours. After riding the mantrip in to the booster I spoke to the stressed out, scared man I was relieving. I told him about the weather topside as we were expecting snow by the time he got outside. He told me it had been a quiet day and he hadn't seen any glimpses of our shadowy visitor. We bullshit for a bit while he waited for the mantrip that would be his ride out of the mine. Eventually, it arrived and he wished me luck while I told him to have a safe drive home. 

I was watching the belts cruise along transporting all that black rock out of the mine when suddenly all of the power kicked off. My work area was instantly plunged into the pitch blackness and the dull roar of the machinery coasted to a stop. The sudden change from bright light and noise to quiet blackness was unnerving. I turned on my caplight and made my way to the power center that controls the juice to check if the power kicked locally or if it was more widespread across the mine. I found all my breakers still set meaning the outage was more than my booster. I got on my radio and confirmed the situation with the power was mine wide. 

I made a seat with some bags of rock dust and leaned against the airlock wall to settle in for a bit. It was at this point I heard it. Footsteps. There were footsteps walking toward me, but, No one was there. I was hoping upon hope I would not see that black human shaped mass out there in the dark. They were heavy footfalls, like the sound of a huge man in work boots. This was bad enough hearing something walking around near me in the dark that I couldn't see, but sometimes the footsteps would increase from a slow walk, to a run, to a sprint, to footsteps so rapid no human could possibly make them. I felt like I was losing my sanity. I cannot possibly describe how incredibly frightened I was. Suddenly, the lights and power kicked on without warning. It was standing 10 feet away from me. I screamed at it to leave me alone, and it turned around and walked away into the darkness. 

I damn near passed out from the shock and fear of it. If I hadn't been sitting on those dust bags I'm convinced my knees would have buckled from under me. Once I had calmed down some I realized I actually had pissed myself a little. Embarassing to admit, I know. If I hadn't urinated so recently I have no doubt I would have soaked my trousers. 

I hate that fucking thing."
t3_eezqn9,all_ads,What's Happening?,Thetruthishere,"I don't understand what's going on. I'm sorry for how long this is in advance. 

So on December 16, 2018, my wife's father passed away. Once we brought his belongings home, I feel like we brought something else too. Our stuff would go missing then reappear later on in the exact same spot that we left it. Mainly lighters. (Something he had a ton of). We ignored that because my wife felt happy knowing he was here with her. Well, the same thing happened in my car a few weeks ago. I was looking for my medicine that I left in there and it was gone. I couldn't find it. About 20 minutes later it was literally put on top of everything in the passenger seat. I ignored it and said her dad was in my car. Nothing new to me at this point. 

Here's where things get weird. Last night around 1230ish I hear 3 loud knocks clear as day. No one lives in the apartment beside me so it wasn't that. I was too far away to hear something from the other apartments. My hair stood up and it scared me. I then start hearing foot steps around the apartment. I put my big girl panties on and go check everything. Everything is fine. My cats were asleep and so was my step daughter and my birds. I try to forget about it. But it was hard. 

All day long today I kept hearing my phone vibrate. But I never had a notification and my volume was turned up and I was playing music all day. On December 25, 2008, my grandmother (my best friend) suddenly passed away. The anniversary is coming quickly. Someone once told me when that happens it means someone who passed is trying to get your attention. I can believe that and so I thought it was her trying to let me know she is here with me because I've been dealing with a lot recently. 

Today, after my wife got home, we shower together before I go to work. She told me there were 3 claw marks on her neck today and she didn't do it or even know how they got there. Her coworker pointed it out. (That honestly terrified me). There was no sign of a mark by the time she got home. They said they were bad marks. When we got out of the shower my wife smelt a candle. Like the smell after you blow it out. I did not smell anything.

The other weird thing is that for two nights in a row my step daughters bed has had a wet spot on it. The first night we thought it was cat pee because he was spraying. Changed her sheets and got her bed. Last night, she says again her bed is wet and I smelt it and it didnt smell like cat pee. It didn't smell like pee at all. Just a big wet spot. I didn't feel like changing her sheets again so we let her sleep on the couch last night. 

So, am I crazy or is there something going on? It seriously has me freaked out."

t3_eewthq,all_ads,The hand,Thetruthishere,"So basically I've had this reoccurring dream / weird thing I don't even know what to call it anymore happen to me a few times.   


I would be in a bed, look right in front of me towards my door, and see a hand poking in from outside the door fully stretched out. I feel like this could be sleep paralysis or just something like it, because it just feels so real. It doesn't feel like I am dreaming but rather living in the moment of it. I've had this happen to me since probably I was 8 years old, I'm 17 now and still live with parents in the same house. Weirdest part is that the hand sometimes isn't even human but can be green from a few experiences. It does nothing, just poking out right in the doorway and that's it. I honestly feel like I am going crazy sometimes because whenever I tell this story, people always think I'm just bullshitting.   


Yes I know, pretty scary picture, but this is the only picture of what I could find of what the hands look like.

t3_eeotd9,all_ads,Things That Go Knock in the Night,Thetruthishere,"Port Orford, Oregon. 

Around 10 PM Saturday. December 21, 2019.

I was in bed when I heard knocking on a tree again. It sounded very close so this time I turned off the TV completely and clapped whenever there was knocking. The window was open so whoever or whatever it is could hear me clearly. It stopped and then knocked twice, so I clapped my hands twice. 

We continued to do this for a few minutes until I decided to make it more complex. Three claps with a pause and then two claps for example. The knocking repeated the beats that I was clapping each time. I started to get spooked so I stopped. Maybe 5 minutes later I hear something big stomp around the perimeter of my fence in the backyard. Went to the window but couldn't see anything. 

I honestly have no idea what this thing is. I know it's not a person because it's way too big, but it sounds like it walks on two feet. Last year this thing made some type of call at me when I pulled into the driveway. Afterwards it decided to scream twice at my window early in the morning. Anyone else having similar experiences? Feel free to send me a message."
t3_eedw4e,all_ads,Things that go bump in the coal mine. Part 2: The shadow men.,Thetruthishere,"So, if you liked my first installment this one may suit your fancy as well. 

I've seen these figures many times in several different mines. They are creepy as hell, and I dislike them immensely. 

My first encounter was just after I had gotten my black hat allowing me free access to the entire mine. I was still wet behind the ears however and given a job that was essentially a baby sitting gig. Go me. The job entailed watching over a machine called a booster drive. It was a machine that was placed along the belt that transported the coal out of the mine on a longwall section. It's whole job was to keep the belt moving and the river of coal moving out of the mine to the process facility. It's usually a cake gig if the beltman did their job correctly. I shovel up any spilled coal, and call in the cavalry if shit goes sideways. 

Now, unlike 95 percent of the rest of the mine the booster drives had lighting installed. The light would spill up the entryway only so far however. Beyond that point, it was that same inky black nothingness I've described before.   

I'd been there for a few days already, and kept catching movement out of the corners of my eye. I grew up shooting and hunting so unnatural movement catches my attention pretty rapidly. It would always dissapear when I tried to look directly at it. Thing is I would feel frightened, and definitely threatened when I would catch fleeting glances of it. It felt....ominous. One day, after a pretty active day of jerking my head at the blackness and seeing movement always retreating into the dark I got angry. And foolish. I called out.....I SEE YOU! Whatever it was took two full strides into the light. It was shaped like a man, same size, height, and shape. Only, it was completely black. A complete absence of light, but it had dimension, a thickness, full and thick like a man. I was so scared I got tunnel vision and it seemed like all of the machinery went silent. I know it didn't because the belts were still chugging away. It stood there for about five full seconds, did an about face and walked away into the dark. I stood staring at the spot for a good 20 seconds afterward until my vision cleared and the steady roar of the booster filled my ears again. My head stayed on a swivel the rest of the shift. When I was relieved I asked the man who took my place on the next shift. ""Uh, you ever see anything moving around down here?"" He took a long look at me, and replied"" yes"". I asked ""what the hell is it?"" He said ""I'm not sure I want to know"". I wish I could say I never saw it again. That thing scared the shit out of me."
t3_eeb2b7,all_ads,Hiking in the UK - elongated humanoid moving on all 4's with an 'n' shaped body,Thetruthishere,"So me and my partner went hiking to a place in central UK - Shropshire. We were walking up to the peak of this hill that is scattered with giant 50-60ft rock formations (small rocks all piled in mounds - google Devils Chair and you can understand).


It was early early morning, sun was rising but the area fully lit and we were all alone, she was behind me struggling to keep up looking down to watch where she is walking so didnt see a thing.


I looked ahead and on the left most mound of rocks there was what I thought was a person. I was pissed off that I'd have to say that bregrudging british ""good morning"" to a complete stranger when I wanted tranquility. 


Suddenly this person bent forward and put all fours on the ground but not bent in half - it had a full u shaped bend like a rainbow and that's when I realised the person wasnt wearing any clothes and then it moved, I cant describe how it moved. Almost like a centipede with precise agility over the rock formations.


Whilst pooping myself I ran ahead to see what the f it was. No animal I have ever experienced in my life, it had gone without a trace. And when I reached the rocks I realised that it possibly stood about 7-8 ft tall on its hind legs.


Safe to say I was on edge the whole hike then and getting back to my car was an absolute highlight.




Update: I have just researched the folklore of the Striperstones - It was created when the devil was crossing the UK with stones and his bag broke and spilled the stones. 


He crafted them in to a chair and decided that every year on the longest night he will come back to earth and sit in his chair. 


Every year on the longest night, people who believe in witchcraft come to perform rituals and summon demons. That night finishes on the 22nd December, I was there at sunrise which brought an end to that night. Now I'm fully creeped out."
t3_eekk3j,all_ads,Three short connected stories from my childhood. (Tag was the best that fit.),Thetruthishere,"Here are three different occurrences from my childhood. Two that were told to me and one I remember.

TLDR: I was aware of a murder next store before it happened.[1] I was almost kidnapped by some kind of shadow man.[2] I was chased through the house by another shadow man (possibly same one that tried to kidnap me.)[3]

1. (Told to me) Our next store neighbor form my childhood, for reasons that have never been explained, murdered his wife one night and failed to murder his kids before committing suicide. My parents say that the afternoon of the murder I was refusing to get out of the care when we got home from school. I was in 1st grade at the time. When they asked why, I said that something really bad was going to happen and that we should leave. They listened and we spent the night at my aunt’s house. We heard the news the next day and were told by police that someone attempted to break into our back door the night before. I think we might have all been spared a grisly fate.  

2. (Told to me) I was playing with toys in our living room around age 4. End of Summer/Fall in Texas, after dinner, screen door is closed but front door is open. Mom is in the kitchen cleaning up dinner mess and dad is helping her. They say I suddenly start saying things like, “No. I don’t want to go.” And “I want to stay.” They thought I was playing with toys so they kept working. I then scream, “NO! GO AWAY!” That gets their attention. When they come into the living room they see me in front of the screen door standing and sweating profusely. When they asked me what was wrong I replied, “The man by the tree wants me to come with him.” My dad acted immediately by grabbing the pistol and flashlight by our front door (on a book case). He goes outside and there is no one on the street, on either side of the house, nor up in our large tree in the front yard. It freaked us all out.

3. (I remember, vividly) My grand parents are visiting when I am in 3rd grade. I’m sleeping in the living room and my grandparents are in my room. In the middle of night I wake to a noise. Something is moving in the corner of the room. I turn on the lamp, nothing. When I turn it off again and my eyes are still adjusting  to the darkness I hear movement again. I wait and a shape emerges. A man. I freak out and start running. This time I can hear footsteps behind me. I get to the top of the stairs to see him almost floating up them. I scream and run to my parents door. I’m banging on it as he gets closer and closer. My dad, angrily, opens the door and sees my terror. After he asks what’s wrong I turn to see nothing there. My mom also comes to the door and sees my face. They let me sleep in their room the rest of time my grandparents are in town. Still have the image of “it” coming up the stairs. Chills every time. 

What do you guys think?"
t3_eep1t6,all_ads,UFO Sighting. Looking for explanations,Thetruthishere,"So, not my story, but I’ve been hearing it my whole life. My dad used to spend his summers on a ranch in Chihuahua, Mexico. There are plenty of creepy stories of possible ghosts and animals showing up dead, but this story is just one he can’t give a logical explanation to. So anyway, in the mid 70’s some time, him and about 10 others were outside just sitting around. The ranch had no electricity, so it was very dark. All of a sudden a light begins to pass over the ranch. Very slowly and so bright that it lit up the entire property. Everyone was staring at the light in complete silence and whatever the light was didn’t make a sound either. Given the time, the description and the location, does anyone have an explanation?

It wasn’t a satellite. My dad had seen satellites many times and this was very different.

We don’t think it was a meteor or a comet because the light did not flicker like fire and did not have a tail.

I’m open to any explanations! I love the paranormal and the extraterrestrial and want to believe so badly, but feel its necessary to explore all possibilities! 

Maybe no explanation but would love to hear similar experiences too!!"
t3_eeg0rt,all_ads,"I was raised in a haunted house, and my experiences didn’t stop there",Thetruthishere,"Hey, all. Relatively new lurker here, and a first time poster.

First thing’s first. I (19F) have had more than my fair share of weird experiences, none of which I’ve enjoyed. Here are a couple of the earliest ones. If you guys have any explanations whatsoever, please, let me know. If you’d like to hear more - and trust me, there’s more, unfortunately - also let me know. Writing everything out to a community that doesn’t judge helps more than anything.

One of my earliest memories is of sitting in the master bedroom of my childhood home. The second floor was laid out weirdly, with a staircase leading directly into the bedroom from the laundry room below, and a bridge / hallway that led to the other half of the house. Sitting in bed, you could see the heads of anyone standing on the landing, and you could see all the way down the hall into the opposite bedroom.

I was alone in the master bedroom that day, playing with toys in bed while my nana did dishes downstairs. I remember hearing footsteps begin to ascend the staircase, but no door opened below, and I sort of froze, watched, and waited. I learned very early on to count the steps and identify people’s strides, so I knew immediately this was no one familiar. Well past the point where I should have been able to see the top of someone’s head, there was nothing. The stairs were old and wooden and creaked like no tomorrow, so I could clearly hear every footfall. The noise stopped when the person would have been standing on the top step, looking in at me - but there was nothing. I didn’t call out or anything, I think I just waited a bit and went back to playing, but I remember spending the rest of that day clinging especially hard to my family’s legs once they all came home.

As for the next experience, remember the room I said you could see into from the master bedroom? Well, this room was temporarily mine - for maybe two months. It was one of three bedrooms off of a little foyer area at the top of the staircase from the living room, and once I was too old for my crib, I was supposed to move into there. The only problem was, it scared me.

I still remember the feeling of wrongness that room always gave me - it felt dangerous. I avoided playing in it during the day, and most nights, I would run down the hall to jump into my grandmother’s bed after hours of sleeplessness. The last night I spent in that room, I remember rolling over toward the door, which was in the same wall against which the head of my bed rested. There was a window in the main staircase’s landing, so the foyer was always moonlit at night, but this meant that I could see, just as clear as anything, the shadow of a man cast on the opposite foyer wall.

He would have been leaned up beside my open door, as if he was listening to me breathe. I don’t know if I managed to fall asleep at all that night - God knows I was too afraid to run down the hallway - but either way, that was the last time I even went into that room. It was my grandmother’s job to clear it out. The worst part? Our security system would have gone off if anyone came into the house, and no men lived there. Unlike whatever came up the staircase that time, which felt neutral at worst, this thing felt... mean. Even as a young child, I knew I would be in danger if I fell asleep or tried to go into the hall. I don’t want to know what would have happened.

If it’s any help as far as theories or explanations, the house I was born in was built in the 1890s, and was, understandably, extremely old and creaky, but well maintained and frequently updated. God knows how many stories the walls could tell, but I can tell you that one owner, in the 1960s, died in the house alone and wasn’t discovered for quite a while. My family is predominant Baptist, and I was raised that way, so there were many Christian texts and items throughout the house, including a plaque of the “now I lay me down to sleep” prayer over my bed in that awful room.

Please, theorize away! If you want me to tell more of my stories, please let me know. I’d enjoy the chance to share. Thank you guys for reading."
t3_eecwwx,all_ads,My first seizure,Thetruthishere,"This  happened nearly a year ago but just found this sub, so here we go:

After nearly a year of having really weird health shit happen (throwing up, passing out, nosebleeds, headaches) with no explanation, I was cleaning my apartment while my wife was hanging out with friends. A little background: I'm a 30 yo female, been  with my  spouse for nearly a decade. We lived in a  nice, old apartment in the CWE in St. Louis at the time. All old wooden floors, a stone balcony that is just off the living room, and then the bathroom is off to the side and the kitchen is at the back- both were tiled with newer sandstone.  I was standing on the balcony taking a break and all  of a sudden, I'm just running. Down the hallway, by the bathroom, by our bedroom. And I don't know why I'm running. My thought was literally ""hey, you're going to fucking fall- slow down, why are you running in the house?"" and then I was in the kitchen, staring at the top of my metal oven. And then- a loud noise, a hard thud, and I'm on the ground, bleeding, my nose gushing from where I've hit it on the oven door. I must have passed out- the images are scattered, in and out of blackness. The first one, I'm laying face down and breathing hard. My mouth tastes like blood, my eyes are heavy and so is my body. I can barely breathe and I remember thinking that I needed to get up because I could feel the blood pooling around and then into my nose and mouth and I know that it's going to drown me if I can't get out of it. And then darkness. For how long, I don't know. I felt- defeated, helpless. And then, weightless. I don't know how long i was out and to this day, I have no idea what happened because all of a sudden, I'm on my back and gasping for breath. The blood is on my face but my airway is clear. I look to the side where the entry way to my kitchen is and my heart just- jumps. Because in the doorway is a man. Tall, thin, his face black and formless. I realized I was unafraid of this man and opened my mouth to say something- what I honestly don't know- but then, my body begins to shake. My brother has a seizure disorder but I've never had one, just seen a couple throughout my life. And I'm confused because I'm shaking but I'm not scared or in pain. My teeth aren't clenched, my tongue isn't dead weight in my mouth. I go to look over at the guy and realize I can't do anything except look at the ceiling and then I hear my own voice. And I say, ""Is this is a seizure? Is that what this is? Are you going to help me?"" And I keep shaking. I don't know how long. But all of a sudden, as I'm looking up at the ceiling, the man, his face still dark, comes into my view. And he's just- looking down at me, his head turning to the side in an almost curious manner. He never speaks, he never does anything, except just looks- and I'm still not afraid. The last thing I remember, he crouches down, shadowed hands reaching for my shoulders and then- nothing. Darkness. Then light. I woke to a gasp and my wife calling 911. She asked me what had happened and I told her I fell in the kitchen, that I think I hit my head. She makes me stay on the ground until the EMT's can get to me and get me on a backboard and get my neck in a collar. When I woke up in the hospital, my nose was broken, my eyes were bruised, my mouth had a few stitches in it. My wife spoke to me briefly until I again surrendered to the drugs and exhaustion. And when I finally did wake, lucid, I told her all of this with like a chuckle because I just KNEW it was all my brain going through trauma and isn't that weird what I saw in the kitchen where I hit my face? And then she got quiet and distant and told me to get some more rest and once the nurse came in and checked my pupil response and talked to me about concussions and seizures and that that was what had to have happened bc the eeg said, so I just accepted that I did and that's all it was. I fell back asleep with the belief that my brain had gone through trauma and created this- person- to comfort me. And maybe it did, y'all. Maybe it did.

But- that will never explain the look on my wife's face the next day when she slowly told me I had called her the day before- or, my phone did, there was no one on the other end, just static, and  it was odd enough and she was near enough to home that she stopped in to check in on me before she went to dinner with her friends- and found me, my face covered in blood, on my side. But she couldn't find the source of all of it- my nose had almost stopped bleeding by then- and couldn't figure out where I had injured myself in relation to the house- because she found me in the living room laying on my side, blood all over me and none on the walls or floor leading from the kitchen- which was at the very back at the house, and the living room at the very front. My hands, my legs, my feet, all had blood on them- if I had crawled or stumbled, there should have been evidence of it. And there just- wasn't.

I'm not religious. I'm not- anything. But I will never be able to explain what happened that day. I'm grateful. I'm thankful. I tell myself it was all a dream, all a symptom of my (now diagnosed) epilepsy, but y'all- I just don't know. We've moved out to a house in the burbs, I take medication and have not had another one since, and I'm okay- but I will never know what truly happened that day.

t3_ee25pl,all_ads,Things that go bump in the coal mine.,Thetruthishere,"Some responses I made about the experiences of myself and coworkers got a lot more attention than I expected. After being repeatedly asked, I decided to make a thread with my stories. 

I spent nearly a decade underground. The work was hard and dangerous, but could bbe rewarding and very well compensated. Coal mining is a way of life here. Entire families have worked the mines. I myself have several family members who have retired or work down there still. I got out. Not because of these experiences, but because I believe coal mining will end soon. There are other reasons, but I don't want to identify myself.


Now, I'm no superstitious backwoods hillbilly who attributed every little thing as paranormal. I have a science and engineering background. Most things have reasonable explanations for the things we see. These stories of mine, or those that were told to me are not the case. They have no explanation. 

The first time I heard of anything going bump in the dark was relayed by a coworker. I was still a redhat at the time. For those who don't know, for the first 6 months to a year, depending on state law, a new miner must wear a red hard hat. They cannot leave sight or sound of the black hat they are assigned to. I was working with a guy about my age, who was a no nonsense guy when it came to work. He was an extremely competent coal miner. We were working with a bolting machine when I looked over at the rib ( the wall) and clearly written on the rib support was the word ""ghost"" followed by the time and date, which was a few weeks prior. Curious, I asked about the writing. 

He gave me a sheepish look, and relayed this story to me. 

""I was working down here off by myself, running the bolter. It was nearing the end of the shift and I was keeping an eye for the relief crew to arrive on section. I just happened to look across the bolter and see a man standing there looking at me. I was just about to say something when I realized that this guy was certainly not on our crew. Then I realized his caplight was emitting no light, and was in fact an old carbide lamp, not our battery powered ones. My adrenaline spiked, and all I wanted to do was run away, but I was rooted to the spot, looking at him, looking at me.  He was about 5 feet away standing behind the bolting machine so just visible from the chest area up. Just as I was about to open my mouth to speak, or scream, I'm not sure, he turned 90 degrees and began walking along the side of the bolter. What is even stranger is with every step he took he would sink lower and lower into the ground until his head was below the edge of the bolting machine.  Picture the stairway gag if you know what I mean. I snapped out of it and ran around the other side of the machine, to see no one there. He was gone. Seemingly sank into the earth with each step. In a daze, I walked to the track and saw that the relief mantrip had not arrived. It was just our crew. I wrote the time and date on the support to help recall where and when I saw this. I returned to that spot many times hoping to see him again. I never did."""
t3_eee4xz,all_ads,The Invisible Window,Thetruthishere,"As previously mentioned, I grew up in an older house.  One of the weirdest architectural features was that there was a window in the attic accessible from the inside, from which you could see outside, but which was not visible on the outside of the house.

It was oval in shape and probably about 15 inches tall, maybe like 10 wide.  It didn't have glass anymore (probably was stained glass at one point, based on other small windows in the home).  Instead, it had a wooden board in the shape of the opening, which latched shut tightly.

I tested it many times with friends, having us take turns (including with multiple people in and out so there were witnesses) having someone stand out front of the house and do a weird action which we'd observe from inside and then compare notes.  We were always accurate in what had been done outside, and the view out the window when the latched piece was open was completely normal - nothing blocked the view.  It was like opening a circle on the side of the house.

But, no one doing actions outside could see the window or those observing from upstairs.  It's one of the weirdest things I've ever dealt with, I straight up have no explanation for how it worked or why."
t3_eeamu2,all_ads,Shadow World?,Thetruthishere,"Almost all of my dreams are connected and very realistic, but also very lucid. In my dreams, I’ll remember a dream I had even as a child and it will be connected, as if what happened in the dream a long time ago happened in my “dream world”.  Nothing too terrifying happens that often, but still I’m always relieved to wake to my “real life.” Does anyone else experience this? It’s getting increasingly eerie."
t3_eebao0,all_ads,Seeing strange things above my bed as a kid,Thetruthishere,"After months of reading creepy posts here and on similar subs I've thought back and recalled what feels like the closest thing to a paranormal experience I've ever had. When I was a little kid I often thought I saw strange things above my bed. The only one of these things I can accurately recall is this face of a man on the wall behind and above the end side of the my bed where my pillow was. I would look up there in the pitch blackness and see a face that moved a lot like the soul sphere from Doom, like just 3 frames of movement which looked like it was moving its facial muscles to make some expression I can't remember. However its appearance was gray and looked like one of those masks you see in theaters to represent comedy and tragedy but possibility with hair and slightly more realistic proportions of the facial features. Its size I estimate to be the size of a baby's head and it made no sounds. 

I told my parents about these strange things and I think I actually saw them over multiple nights I dunno really. It felt like I saw the head for a while looking up to it and because it scared me I think I would look away and then look back up again and it would still be there. I wished it would just end. My dad said these things must have been mirages and that's when I first heard of that phenomenon and that you tend to see them in deserts. When I told mother about the man she asked me if I was frightened but I didn't want her concerned so just said ""No, he was making funny faces at me!"""
t3_ee69mr,all_ads,In the Woods,Thetruthishere,"I was hiking on a trail that I knew well with my dog (a one year old pit-lab mix) last summer. It was the longest, farthest trail there (about 8 miles long), so not many people went along it. We were a little more than halfway through the trail when I totally zone out and I'm just walking, but I feel absolutely no connection to the rest of my body. My dog broke that when she started growling and barking. I looked over my shoulder and there's a woman there in khakis and a sweater. Weird. My dog would not let her pet her (usually she was very friendly and loved everyone). She said something along the lines of, ""It's so beautiful out here that it's easy to get lost, right? Stay with your dog, she has good instinct."" I looked at her and nodded, realizing that her eyes were all black. I pretended not to notice, but I knew damn well that something was not right. She turned and walked into the woods marked private property and just disappeared from there. I hurried back as fast as I could. After that, I always brought either another person or my dog. And salt.

I went back there recently, and I was on the same trail with my brother, and we saw boot prints in the mud, a handful of dead animals along the way, and a piece of plywood in a tree with almost no branches that had an office swivel chair on top of it. This was just over the private property line.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what's going on with any of that, so I figured I'd come here to get some ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: This was on a state nature reserve. There was a specific hiking area and then there was just private property lines to mark where people were not allowed to be."
t3_ee73if,all_ads,I think we saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft 5 years ago,Thetruthishere,"This happened 5 years ago. I was hanging out with 3 of my friends at this place up on a hill overlooking the ocean. It was a few minutes before sunset and the sky looked so beautiful. When out of the nowhere, I noticed a small ball of light floating over the ocean far away below. It was floating closer to the surface just moving in a straight line, and at first we thought it was probably a small fishing boat because it was too far to see it clearly. We could not really tell how fast it was either. 

And then suddenly it started to move upwards and it did not stop. It just kept going up and up until the sky grew darker and it became to small for us to see. Until today, we still can’t figure out what It really was. We did not initially think it was extraterrestrial in nature because it had never occurred to us something like that would ever happen where we lived. But as years passed and we still had not figured out what it was, I started to wonder if it had actually been an extraterrestrial object and we had been too stunned and confused to take our phones out and record it."
t3_ee6fkz,all_ads,Tapping on the Windows,Thetruthishere,"A few years ago, right before I'd go to bed, there would be a tapping on my window. My window faced my yard (which was two acres), and I only had people over 50 for neighbors. It was always the same window, at the same time. It was not every night, but the nights that it happened, I'd wake up at 3:30 am. It followed, even when I went into my sister's room, and she heard it too. Whatever it was also left me little ""presents"" on my windowsill. These were usually birds with the wings ripped off and the intestines hanging out of the poor thing's body. It stopped when I put protection warding around my room and salt on the windowsills. It hasn't happened since.

Edit: The cut where the intestines were pulled out of the bird was a clean cut, and the wings, although messily ripped off, were always laid one on top of the other next to the carcass."
t3_edy3ky,all_ads,I think I saw a ghost in an abandoned factory in West Virginia,Thetruthishere,"I invited my friend to come with me and explore an abandoned factory with me in a nearby historicish city. There was only one way in, and that's through a window on the side of it by some railroad tracks. We went inside and started exploring the building, which we know gangs use as a little hideout occasionally, but that didn't deter us. Most of the inside was nothing but rubble, broken glass, and graffiti. There were letters and numbers spray painted on the wall in blue, like A15 and B7, but it was obvious a person spray painted it because it looked unprofessional.
  
  So after going around for a bit, I started to feel a sense of heavy dread, I took out my camcorder to record, but it was dead, despite charging it the night before. I'm not sure how my buddy felt because I didn't ask. We eventually get to this huge space in the basement of the place, and looking around, I saw a chair, under crying eyes of blood. I assume the eyes were spray painted, but I wasn't about to check it out. (https://imgur.com/a/MakZjOm - The eyes, taken with my phone)
  
  We didn't want to go near it, and my friend wouldn't enter the room at all. We left the room and went out to the courtyard, which had a broken window on a platform. We walked up the ramp to the platform and went on it, and went inside the window. Now this was a separate building full of offices. We went down to the basement of this one, and we realized we were back in the same damn room. We turned around and walked out and we stood at the doorway just staring at it. At the very end of the room, where the eyes and the chair was, we saw a dark figure sprint from the chair to the other wall across from it, without making a single noise and it disappeared from our view.
  
  We decided to get out right then, so we went back upstairs to climb out the window. I let my friend through first, and while I was climbing out, I heard the noise of someone walking on glass towards me. I got out and we went back inside the main part through the courtyard. When we got inside, we were back in the basement, but a different room. We made our way through it to reach the closest staircase to the exit, and we walked into this room. In the corner where it's almost completely black, we found a corpse, a couple hours old by the looks of it. We just left the building and went to a local Chinese restaurant to take our mind off things.
  
  The creepier part, is when I returned a few weeks later, I got lost inside there, and without realizing it, I walked into that same room with the eyes, except I didn't recognize it because the eyes and the chair just vanished. I only realized it when I got home.
  
  I'm going to go back there with an extra battery and try to find out where it went on Monday, December 23rd. I'll post an update here with a YouTube video of the whole exploration, and if I don't, then something probably happened to me."
t3_ee50hp,all_ads,I saw the moon fall out of the sky,Thetruthishere,"When I was little we were sitting on a plane waiting to take off. We were absolutely not moving people were still boarding. I remember staring out the window and looking at the moon, it was during the day but you could still see the moon like you do. It was a crescent moon and it just started to fall out of the sky like a feather! I want to emphasize that and I wish I could draw something out to show you, it first fell slowly so it was a U shape then like as if it was falling through water maybe is a good comparison slowing and turning all different ways. I was little and didnt think it was that crazy I just thought the moon must have did that sometimes! I know what I saw I dont want anyone to say the plane started to take off so it looked like the moon was moving it was not like that believe me, i just cant explain how I saw that, im thinking a ufo maybe? But the way it fell was not a way id think a alien ship would fly."
t3_ee7g74,all_ads,Orange star in Australia.,Thetruthishere,"When I was around 15-16 years old, me and a mate of mine were walking to the shopping centre from his place. I grew up in the west of Melbourne and it was about 20 minute walk. On the way there I noticed an orange dot that looked like a star but out of place. I kept an eye on it for about half an hour and I asked my mate if he knew what it was and he said it's probably a comment or something. But it didn't move for ages, just kept glowing. Eventually it flew off and still today I don't know what I saw. The closest I've seen is a similar thing that happens in the Nordic countries but this wasn't in a group or some sort of southern lights, just very odd."
t3_ee2uae,all_ads,I saw a perverted figure sitting in my window sill.,Thetruthishere,"Not a long story, just wanted to share my experience and maybe see if anything similar happened to someone else. 

To start off, a few people experienced weird paranormal things in the room that I grew up in. Sometimes they would get intense feelings of disapproval and would hear someone talking to them while I was asleep, telling them not to move, not to talk. When I was home for college one summer I had a friend over. We hooked up a little bit and then he left around 3am and I went to bed. I always slept with my window open since I lived in a dimly lit country area and you could see the stars. While I was lying down I got a weird feeling and turned over to face my window. It looked like there was a shadow of a figure sitting in the sill seemingly pleasuring themselves. I remember thinking, ""am I dreaming?"", but I had just laid down for bed and turned the lights out. After staring for a few seconds that felt like an eternity the figure dissipated into the night. 

The room I grew up in was the second floor, with no trees or anything that could have cast a shadow onto my window. There was no where for anyone to actually sit. I think about it every once in a while and get the chills and feel like I have to shut all of my blinds."
t3_ee9sfp,all_ads,"A Dream, The Satan and The Cosmos.",Thetruthishere,"Caution : Hell of a long read. Sorry.

The incident is quite a recent one so it is a little fresh in my mind and moreover I can never forget it. Maybe brain will do things and mend it the way it seems fit to my perceptions but I'll let it out here as it happened, before any of that.

I returned home, as usual had food, spent a little family time and was back to bed in my room. A little internet surfing, a little chatting and then most needed sleep.

I remember keeping my phone aside and sleeping around 2320hrs. I love dark rooms, like I prefer a room to be dark and not lit even in the day. I feel safer and better that way. The room is dark and I fall asleep.

I wake up, check the time on phone it is around 0021hrs. I woke up because I sensed there is someone around me. I didn't actually wake up out of fear but just because I sensed something and an immediate reflex action was me opening my eyes. 

There is no one around me except the usual stuff just the dark room and me. Out of nowhere a thought strikes my mind. What if it is the Satan around me. Strange enough but I have always been curious about the Satan and satanic cults but never really made it a point to know or read about that stuff. I laugh to this thought and go back to sleep.

Hey, that's Satan right there. I can just see a shadow figure of his body. He seemed like a normal human and the horns seemed just like some crown. It was literally a body silhouette. I am at the table and about to sign a deal. I sell my soul to Satan on the contingency that I will be able to manipulate all the aspects of reality be it in any realm on my command. I reach a bargain. The deal is signed, my soul sold. The bargain being, I mend the reality on my own will but, just in Human Realm not beyond that. 

I wake up, it is 0130hrs. I thank myself that it was just a dream but it all felt so real. I am still pretty much chilled about whatever is happening. I convince myself that it was just a dream and I am thankful that I didn't sell my soul but I still am curious and am waiting to use the powers bestowed on the off chance of it being not just a dream but something more. I am eagerly waiting for the dawn. I go back to sleep yet again.

The trouble starts. Maybe I am dreaming again. I hear a voice constantly asking me to draw blood of my loved ones to prove my loyalty to Satan. I am trying to avoid the voice but it keeps repeating itself. Finally I voice out my dissent for doing anything such. I strongly disagree with any such initiation. I try to find an alternate route possible but to vain. I wake up due to this constantly irritating voice. It is just 0149hrs. I am still convincing myself it is just a dream.

I close my eyes and I am taken back to somewhere in a dark room. I feel my consciouness. I feel what is happening around. It isn't a dream anymore. Its chaos all around, nothing in any order, in any pattern. Everything is constantly moving around. I randomly see images of places around my locality, memories from my past, images of random people who I may or may not have seen or met earlier. It is utter chaos.

I see the same person, the one who I addressed as the Satan. He asks for blood, I am ready to give mine. He asks of the blood of my loved ones. I am not giving up. This wasn't a part of the deal. He now wants me to mentally harass my near and dear ones. I am terrified by now. I agree just to escape the situation. I am back in my senses. It is 0216hrs.

I close my eyes and random flashes of people troubling another humans start getting projected at me. At one point I see myself engaged in a row with my family. It has never happened yet. I don't know what it is about but I can instantly feel my family hurting. I start shedding tears to that. I make up my mind and decide to go against the evil.

It is 0219hrs. I close my eyes and start calling out the demon. I can hear myself saying come and take my soul away from me if you dare doing that and if you succeed I will be forever yours, if not you let me be but the deal remains intact. I feel I am filled with immense power and strength sadly everything was about to turn unfortunate.

0245hrs on the clock and I am hit with sleep paralysis. I am awake but I can't move my body even a bit. My hands feel heavy, I can't even lift my legs, it feels as though somebody has tied me up. My abdomen literally feels like stone. I can't shift my weight. Immense pain and agony that's all I can say about it. It kept going on and on I can't do a thing. An hour passed by but my condition didn't elevate. It is rather worsening.

Every muscle in my body is in immense pain, to the point I start crying real bad. There is nothing I can do. I started praying to the Cosmos to come help me, save me from this situation. I pray to all the positive energies in this cosmic multiverse and in multiverse which only higher consciouness can comprehend. I just pray to get rid if this. Tired of everything my eyes shut to the only hope, cosmos.

Finally my body feels light, I can move it the way it should. 0511hrs the phone screen said. The worst time has passed by. I am happy for that, too damn much. It was a one of a kind experience and a first one also the worst. This chain of events have taken a toll on my body, the following day I get diagnosed with stomach infection while also feeling totally exhausted. 

I don't know what happened to me, I don't know if I really sold my soul. All I know is that the Cosmos saved me and it will continue to do so. The positive energy that so many people reflect back into to universe called in a rendezvous to save my drowning ass. The truth is here."
t3_edti92,all_ads,I saw an alien ship,Thetruthishere,"When I was in fourth grade I was on a bus on the way to school, just staring out the window. I heard a weird buzzing sound and when I looked at the sky I clearly saw a flying saucer with blinking lights on the sides and I freaked out. It just hovered there for a few seconds then warped into space. Everybody on the bus just called me weird. Somehow, nobody else had heard the buzzing or seen the flying saucer."
t3_edk7xk,all_ads,I saw something in a decommissioned mine.,Thetruthishere,"I work in 3d laser scanning.  I laser scan things to capture the geometry of the site when bad things happen.  Think car accidents or industrial accidents.  When bad things happen, I show up to document the scene so that when lawyers argue over what was what there is an actual 3d model of what was actually what.

&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago, maybe 2012-ish?  I went to a coal mine in West Virginia.  No idea which.  But that coal mine was decommissioned.  It was done and the entrance was slated to be filled with 25ft of concrete the next week.  An accident happened way down there and they wanted the mining machine and the area documented, since it would be inaccessible in the future.  So I scanned the area and the machine and that was about that.

&amp;#x200B;

This particular area was near the end of the run.  It wasn't a straight down mine like you might imagine, it was a three mile ride on some personnel rail cars to the end.  It was basically into the hill, not straight down.

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a FACT anyone in that mine was on our ""train"" of carts.  On the way down you see that there's hundreds of offshoots where the coal was mined, all lighted.  All like 90 degrees from the rails.  These were mined early.  The ""train"" kept going for 3 miles or so to get to where we went.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent a long time setting the scene.  Whew.  Anyway the weird thing happens on the way up.  It takes like 45 minutes to go in and out from where we were.  On the way up I am just randomly looking out, the seats face 90 degrees from the train travel.  And we come up to another side passage and I see a fucking little girl standing at the end of one of the tunnels.  Like 30 ft away.  Just standing there.  I saw a hundred of those tunnels, but I saw a little girl in one.  It shocked me.  After that I just looked down and never looked into the void of those tunnels again.  My co-worker asked me if I saw something in the tunnels.  I said yes, and we never talked about it further."
t3_edlluq,all_ads,My 3 year old sister is scared of her toys talking to her.,Thetruthishere,"i'm not really sure where to go to ask, so I'm posting around for some advice, any is appreciated; for some context, we moved into a house around the beginning of December last year. we had never experienced anything more unexplained than a few creaks and squeekes before moving here.

the first few weeks were pretty normal, but we would notice my 3 year old sister (2 at the time of moving in) would stare and almost watch something, and when we'd ask, she'd tell us she was watching a cat. this continued for a good month or two, but she never showed any signs of being scared or anything. 

a couple months later, there were a handful of occasions she would wake up in the middle of the night, screaming and shaking, with no explanation, she was terrified, and in too much of a state to explain. she'd usually cry herself until she was too exhausted and fell asleep. we never asked her the following day, as to not cause any stress for her (she has extremely bad breakdowns, and we believe shes on the spectrum somewhere), until it got too common to be bad dreams. i gave in and asked her, and was met with ""i dont like it when my friend comes at night"" (cue panic mode lol) but wtf?

in the recent weeks, we've had some small things happen, a coin being picked up and dropped out of no where, headphones have rolled over, the damn touchscreen on the washing machine will never stop beeping. but one thing has really stood out. about a month ago, we bought my 3yo sister an Eevee toy (she's been a big fan of the pokemon because of our brother and my boyfriend lol) she fell in love with it. she's never been attached to a toy before, but she would refuse to go out without eevee, wouldn't sleep without her, wouldn't even go to the toliet or have dinner without her. until 3 days ago. she began to throw eevee across the room and seem really upset about something, she'd refuse to have eevee in the room at bedtime. at first we thought maybe she was losing interest, as most kids do, but when we asked her why, she said ""i don't want eevee to talk to me like that anymore.""

i could be crazy, but too much stuff is adding up to me, and i know spirits can target children based on their naivety and innocence, but does this seem the case to anyone else? or could it just be her? i dont really know what to think and any advice or comments, even similar experiences, would help me feel a little less clueless😊"
t3_edmisb,all_ads,I Saw Something Driving Home,Thetruthishere,"This was several months ago, during the summer. I’m sorry if this isn’t the most interesting thing you’ve ever read, but here it is. I was coming home from work one night, it was probably around 9:45. 

I turn down the main drag for my suburb, that branches off into several other streets, mine included. And maybe about 50 feet in the air, several streets in front of me, I see and orange-yellow, bright, perfectly circular light. Just hovering. Like a harvest moon, planted right in the middle of my neighborhood. 

I drove past some very tall trees, and it was gone. Completely gone, without a trace. I doubled back, saw nothing. I parked at my house and looked around the sky, nothing. I have no clue what it was, it was incredibly bizarre. The weirdest thing was not only it disappearing so fast, but that it wasn’t illuminating anything, as bright as it seemed to be. There was no full moon that night, much less a harvest moon. No such lights are anywhere in my neighborhood. It was very odd."
t3_edkuhd,all_ads,I think I was briefly possessed by something,Thetruthishere,"A very strange thing happened to me when I was a teenager that I was thinking about recently. I live in New Mexico and when I was 16 years old my family took a trip to visit a civil war battlefield. We spent the day there watching the reenactors and looking at the cannons and listening to the historical society members talking about the battle. For some reason, I don't remember why, we joined a group of non native american people to watch a native american dance ceremony when it was dark. I remember the drums and I remember a boy in a headdress jumping over a fire over and over again, he did it more times than I could count, running in a circle and jumping over the fire. And each time he did it I began to feel just a bit more strange. Just off. The ceremony ended and I felt dizzy and nauseous. We got into the car and began to drive off. I started to feel unbearably hot and demanded we open the windows (it was fall so the night air was nippy). I felt like I was choking on something, like I had swallowed something and it was going to come out. I smelled smoke and remember talking frantically although afterwards none of my family recalled my acting strange. I felt like something was lodged in my throat while I burned up with a fever. My stepdad turned on the radio and ACDC's ""Thunderstruck"" began to play.  For some reason in my memory, it's just the chanting introduction to the song that played on repeat getting louder and louder. When Brian Johnson finally said ""THUNDER"" I stuck my head out the window of the car and felt like I was puking only nothing physical came up out of me I just remember EXPELLING something out into the night while that ACDC song played. I felt better and as I looked out the window I saw what looked like a black cloud, made of dust, pass over the moon. Like a shifting thing made out of the black of TV static and it was gone. I felt fine then, having gotten whatever IT was out from being inside me. I stopped feeling weird. Years later I would see the TV show Lost and I was deeply disturbed when I saw The Smoke Monster character because whatever I saw that flew in front of the moon and seemed to have gotten inside me during the dance and been expelled from me looked uncannily like that cloud of living black smoke made popular by that program. The other fictional thing that reminded me of what I saw was the cloud/ alien/ thing in the Milla Jovovitch film ""The Third Kind"" the thing that carries the child out of the top floor bedroom window. It's the feeling of having SOMETHING inside me that wanted and needed to get out that I remember the most and that's a bit harder to compare to anything I've ever seen in fiction. This actually happened and I am not bullshitting here. Any ideas on what happened to me on that night?"
t3_ed51hk,all_ads,I don't know what I encountered in the Australian Woods,Thetruthishere,"  

After reading all the anecdotes on here, I wanted to write down my own experience that still freaks me out just thinking about it, I’m unsure if here is the best place to post it or anywhere else so suggestions welcome, still pretty new to reddit.

Just down the road from where a few years ago I had previously lived-in South-East Australia, is the opening into about 100 Acres of woodlands and bush that I frequently went into when I younger to do the usual things, riding and camping etc.

I was out driving at around 11:30pm with my girlfriend and as we were in the area decided to show her the woodlands while we were in the area as she loves everything to do with nature and it was summer so an extremely warm night.

I left my car with the lights shining into the trees as we weren’t going too far in and it was pitch black inside and the two of us just kind of sat chatting, having a smoke and generally relaxing, she was sitting on a sort of map of the area that had been put in on some plastic and I was keeping an eye on the trees as I had a feeling that something was just wrong.

I’ve read on here a few people have said that they have felt that they were in danger although nothing around them was off and it was this same feeling, every sense was almost reaching out and my adrenaline was up but there wasn’t really anything in my eyeline that seemed any different.

After lighting another cigarette to calm my nerves, I scanned the treeline again and realised that it looked different to before. It was only after starting into the dark that I saw that there was moonlight now lighting up grass where it couldn’t before as there was a black shape blocking it that before I thought was a tree.

I’ve got goosebumps just typing this but the only way to describe was that all sound just ceased and everything went dead silent and a few seconds later, this disgusting feeling of dread fell over me and I saw motion in the dark of the path as this thing crawled towards us on all fours. I’ve seen nearly every animal in the outback here and we don’t have any large predators like in the US or Europe but somehow I knew this thing was a predator and it wasn’t hiding itself from us but just slowly crawling forward towards us. 

I don’t know if my girlfriend saw it or night as I couldn’t look away but just as it reached the line my carlights were able to illuminate, it reared up onto two legs and just sat staring at us. 

I am 6’4 and this thing was about another metre larger than me, with arms that were far too long that reached down near the ground and all I could make out was an off-white almost yellowish fur on it and in the dim-light could make out the silhouette of its head as like a dog or wolf. 

I wasn’t able to move as it stared at me but it was at this point my girlfriend gasped which seemed to break of whatever was stopping me from thinking logically. I grabbed her by the arm and sprinted to my car, slammed the doors and tore out of there as fast as I could, both of us too scared to speak until about half an hour later.

We’ve both discussed it many times and the feeling that we had was what I imagine a rabbit see’s when it catches a wolf or fox looking at it, that this is something that would be able to end us with absolute ease if it so chose. 

Neither of us have been able to come up with any explanation for what it was but it has definitely changed the way I view the woods and bush and when I go camping or hiking now, I think back to that and wonder what it was and if I will every see anything like it again."
t3_edb6w8,all_ads,Did I see an alien?,Thetruthishere,"Hello Reddit! Greetings from Italy, here I have a story that I want to share, to see if someone had experienced something similar, or to find some explanations.

I was maybe 7 or 8 y/o (now I'm 22), I was in my bedroom getting ready to sleep. My mother was in the other room, waiting for my dad coming back from work. The door of my bedroom was closed. It was summer I guess, cause I remember having the windows open, the room was dark with no light, except for the moonlight and the light coming from our garden. As soon as I lay in bed (I remember I wasn't really tired, I wanted to stay up with my parents) I look towards the nearest wall (30 cm from the wall) and I see this clear figure slowly standing and looking at me. I start screaming my lungs out and in a couple of seconds (an eternity for me) my parents get in scared by the screaming. As soon as they get in the figure disappear and I'm looking just the wall.  I'm really scared and I start crying and I tell everything my parents who decided to call the nearest priest to bless the house and me (WTF).

Anyway, I remember this figure really clearly even though I was really really young. The same night I described it as an ""alien with a black coat, like the death"". And in fact it was this little figure, maybe 1.50 meters tall, dark green, or dark gray, with a black coat on his body and a hood on his head. The eyes were long, oblique and black, I could see his face thanks to the lights coming form the windows. I remember a small mouth and that's it. The fact is that why I have to imagine an alien in this way? I mean, I have never seen movies with aliens in my life, in have never be really interested, and as I remember, if you ask a kid to draw an alien he probably would draw a really tall alien, without any clothes.

t3_ed5qpj,all_ads,A time I was in the woods,Thetruthishere,"Back when I was a young lad, me and my buddy went into the woods for the first time without his dad. The woods were about a mile deep, but were right next to a cornfield so if we ever got lost, we could walk up to the cornfield and literally follow it straight back to his house. Well a few strange things  happened. First, the woods were silent. No wind, no wildlife, nothing. Secondly, when I we were walking, we stepped on a moss, fungi, mushroom (I dont really remember what it was) and a little greenish cloud spewed out of it. It literally looked like the stereotypical cartoon fart. The first two are probably explainable by weather conditions, and actual plant life. This third thing though, kinda wacky shit. We were walking, and we started hearing a noise behind us. It had been so quiet previously that we could here our ears ring. It was wack. When we heard the noise we turned, and even though the noise sounded close by, we saw a weird looking dude in the distance. It literally looked like a dude in a metal diving suit. Imagine the dudes from 20,000 leagues under the sea. That was what this guy was wearing, but he had a gas mask looking thing on. It was some freaky shit. The guy definitely noticed us, and my buddy and I lost our shit. I literally started screaming and shit, and my buddy took off towards the corn (which had been cut, so it was a literal straight shot back). I am a freeze dude myself. No fight, no flight. I literally hid behind a tree and started crying. After a while I looked back and the guy was gone. Eventually, the kids dad came out into the corn field on a 4 wheeler, and brought me back. (Sidenote of no relevance. I was out there for probably an hour. I really had to use the bathroom, but I was too scared to go back, so I shit in the woods. My first and my last time I ever did that). I ended up going home early, and I still dont know what the fuck or who the fuck that was. It was humanoid, if not just a dude in a weird wet suit/ rad suit. I told my mom and dad and they said I was overly dramatic. His parents thought it was a demon (super religious parents btw) and prayed over us and shit. It was a really weird thing, and now that we are in college, people literally think it is a memory gone bad, or like just a story I tell when I'm drunk. The fact of the matter is that I remember it with clarity. It's really weird. You guys are masters of the weird, so feel free to speculate, punch holes in this experience, and give me advice. Nobody believes me, so I come to people I know would believe."
t3_ecrrix,all_ads,Priest Souls?,Thetruthishere,"I have only ever had 2 encounters with things considerably ""supernatural"" that I could vividly remember. One may have been just the wind causing my cousin's bedroom window to rattle. It rattled every time I denied that my cousin saw a ghost like he said he saw the night before. This happened many many years ago. 

Anyway the other one happened in either 2013 or 2014 on my senior year of high school. My then gf at the time claimed her house was like a portal between dimensions of the living and dead and that she couldn't shower for more than 5 minutes because there was a black spirit of a little girl in her shower that could maybe harm her. She claimed her family was Catholic but they had strange practices involving spirits. Don't know if it has to do with her Chinese ancestry or what. They believed that in each generation of their family someone has to take on some kind of burden for the rest of their lives involving spirits. She told me her mom was supposed to be a nun but then backed out on the day of her coronation so apparently my gf took on that ""burden"" in her stead. She also claimed that ever since we got together she had been having the same dream every night where spirits from Filipino folklore would kill her family in brutal ways like how everyone died in the end of that Blood C anime. Anyway, one day she conducted an experiment for me and my curious friend. We did it in the sports complex of our high school after class hours. Mind you, I don't have the so-called ""third eye"". I say ""so-called"" because I'm like Philip from the Bible and won't believe spirits are truly real until I see them for myself. Back to the story. My friend and I were extremely curious to witness some paranormal phenomenon so she gathered us and had the 3 of us Indian sit in a triangle formation facing each other on the ground. Me and my friend took turns. I went first. I had to cover my ears with my hands and shut my eyes without peeking or opening them until told. I had to listen to the silence to ""hear them"" as instructed. She told me to stop listening and open my eyes if I felt like a presence was ""getting too close to me"". After a few seconds of focusing and trying to ignore sounds from the environment, I pick up on what sounds like 2 grown males, maybe between the ages of 30-40 having a conversation, get this. In Latin. Priests maybe? I have also never heard Latin before other than that once chant in Adventure Time, but I was certain it was Latin. My school is run by Jesuit Catholic priests. Not sure how old my school is exactly, but maybe it's old enough like other schools in the Philippines where there used to be priests nuns and friars running the school and now their souls still linger. That's why I'm almost certain they were conversing in Latin. The sound of their voices were growing louder and more audible in my ear as if they were walking side by side and coming down the steps behind me, even though I was a good 20 feet away from the staircase. My gf tried to wake me and get me to stop but I wanted to keep on listening. I was so intrigued. When their voices got so close that they sounded like they were speaking in full volume right next to my ear she grabbed a hold of my arm and that's when I opened my eyes. 

My friend went next and I observed him. His facial expressions showing the same level of intrigue as mine. Afterwards, he said he heard a little girl crying distantly. My gf told me when we were done that had I not opened my eyes a second sooner, one of the spirits could have entered my body. I still think about it to this day and I know it would be best to keep away from all that. The topic of the supernatural always tickles my curious pickle. Though people I know who claim to see and hear say they wish they could just be normal like everyone else. So if it is real, I'll just continue to ponder and keep my pickle on the safe side.

I don't seek advice just want to hear ur guys' thoughts, similar experiences. For discussion purposes only."
t3_ecljsf,all_ads,Winged Creature,Thetruthishere,"June of 2013, my wife and I with our youngest son (11) at the time, were sitting by a small fire in our back yard in Groveland, MA.  The last ribbon of purple light lay on the horizon where the sun had disappeared.

We were all looking up to see who would be first to spot a satellite.  We all saw it at the same time.   Larger than large with a condor-like profile.  The wings were so large that they looked clumsy and slow.  It was only visible for a few seconds at treetop level or so.

After it disappeared into inky night we all agreed that it was massive and was not an eagle, heron or any other 'common' big bird in the area.

We never saw it or anything resembling it again."

One day I woke up to a perfect 3 scratched into my leg. I mean PERFECT manuscript. I read my friends tarot cards a week later and he experienced a demon attachment right after the reading. (I experienced poltergeist activity so I know it was real) was this 3 a warning for what was to come? Was it the demon itself? I also see 333 all the time and I don’t know why.

t3_ecetbd,all_ads,Last Night I Saw a UFO and It Was Probably a Spacecraft,Thetruthishere,"So technically at like 2:30/3 am this morning (18.Dec.19) my mom woke me up to come see something. I was startled by her urgency and I followed her to a window in our home. Outside there was a foreign light floating in the sky. We see planes and towers from our home, and this was none of those. Upon further inspection the light was blinking (mostly a white light but had greens and reds). The light was also moving side to side. at first only slightly and then more and more as we watched. I live in Will County, Il. I’m hoping that maybe someone else seen this UFO last night/early this morning because it was my first real experience with seeing a true UFO and from what I’ve heard/read online of other UFO sightings this is how they act.

We even googled to see if we were seeing a satellite or the SSI and we weren’t supposed to be able to see either at that time last night. One article claimed it was a planet, but in my experience planets don’t move side to side like that.

Edit: It’s now 3 pm (18.Dec.19) we can see the UFO in the sky again. We see it then a plane flies close to it and it becomes faint and then disappears. My mom is convinced it’s just a satellite but I think it’s a spacecraft."
t3_ech9de,all_ads,my fiancé’s sister brought a spirit into our house,Thetruthishere,"we’ll call her e, my fiancé is j. 

e has been mentioning a spirit in her bedroom that she’s noticed over the last couple weeks. she apparently has been to a medium and they said that it was the spirit of her grandfather (who didn’t really like e when he was alive.) she claims the spirit follows her everywhere, and last night everyone felt the presence first hand. 

we were watching tv on my laptop after having come inside from a smoke, and suddenly there’s a crash in the living room closet. everyone’s heads turn in that way, and e immediately says “that’s my spirit. i’ve asked it in the past to speak to me through my tarot cards instead of doing things like that because they scare me.” she pulled out her tarot cards to start shuffling them, and 3 cards fall out immediately upon picking them up. they were the father of swords, the daughter of wands and the hanged man. she felt drawn to doing a past present future spread, and what revealed itself gave us all chills. 

when we were out smoking, e was talking about her and j’s father, who tries his best but ultimately falls short as a father a lot. he’s dealt with a lot but kinda took it out on his children and e now doesn’t speak to him or really much of the rest of the family because of this hurt. she wants him to understand how he hurt her but he is not receptive to listening.

the spread basically told her that some hard thing is going to happen soon with her father if there’s ever going to be an end to this hurt. she initially said no to this, like she didn’t want to, and started to put the cards away, but the daughter of wands fell out again, as did the ace of swords. this reading told her that she needs to do it and was pushing her further to have this conversation or fight or whatever it’s going to be, if she wants a resolution. 

it was super weird because i’ve never had anything paranormal happen in any of the houses i’ve ever lived in, and i know that the house were in now has no energy whatsoever. i guess e has a lot of unpacking to do coming up.

tl/dr:fiancés  sister came to visit, my house, has a spirit attached to her that decides to tell her some heavy stuff about her situation with her dad through her tarot cards"

I used to go to the doctor's with it and they would tell me wax build up (use drops or the syringe thing) and I think it is. It's a dull deafness but why does it keep happening. I feel like I'm deaf more often than I should be and that it's getting worse. I also get ringing in my ears every now and then and I've come across opinions that this too is or can be a spiritual thing..  Now that I've typed it out I feel like I sound ridiculous. But I know how important sound and frequencies are spiritually and physically. I recently had a short consultation with a subconciousness therapist. I asked him about it and he said that I could be being blocked by my guides from  awakening because I'm not ready. That they could be doing it as protection.  I wouldn't even have been promted to post. Untill last night. Last night.. I put on some binary meditation music and fell asleep. I was woken up by what felt like a punch to my left eye. What is going on. It made me jump out of my sleep (obviously) and the music was still on and it sounded scary and unpleasant so I turned it off.

t3_ebwzj1,all_ads,"A new house under construction, bad Vibes",Thetruthishere,"For the last few weeks my hubby and the crew has been working on a new house, which is still under construction. I had been to the house several times, doing my Boss Wife duty. They hung and finished the drywall throughout this huge monstrosity. He calls on Sunday for me to go over there to find one of his squares for another job they had started. I loaded up my grand daughter and off we went. This house is way off in a rural area of the county next to the one I live in, Big Time Boonies. 

I am very sensitive to spirits and other paranormal activity. I had gotten bad vibes from that house every time I went there. No worries, when I went the crew and other workers were there. This time it was gonna be just me and my grand daughter. Luckily she fell asleep in the Jeep on the way over. She did wake up when we got there, I told her to stay put, and she did. 

I have been in countless new constructions in the 25+ years we have owned our business. None have ever put me on edge like this one has. I did a walk through of the first floor, I heard the house settling, Ok no worries, that’s what that noise was. If you have never been in a new house like that before, footsteps on sub flooring has a distinctive sound, and there’s an echo. I heard a second set of footsteps. I stood still for a few minutes, I still heard it. I knew it wasn’t the Monkey Bug, she’s only 5 years old, these sounded like grown up footsteps. I had to go check the attic room, as I was going up the stairs, I heard a loud bang, like a tool or something being dropped. 

After a second walk through of the first floor, I called the hubby on FaceTime. He told me to go back up to the attic room, oh joy I am terrified of heights. So back up I go, and found the square behind some window screens. It wasn’t there when I checked the first time. I grabbed it and made a beeline for the door. I felt like I was being watched by something ominous the entire time. That’s a feeling I know all too well. 

Later that night I let him know I will NOT go back to that house ever by myself. I explained why. Bad JuJu and Vibes from that property. He said to me “If anyone would know that, it would be you.” 

I live in Alabama, I swear every square inch of this state is haunted in some way."
t3_ec69q9,all_ads,What is this noise?,Thetruthishere,"
Hello reddit, 

I am usually not the one to ask questions but rather answer them; but this time my experience is completely useless. 

For a little context; I live right across the street from an active cemetery. In the summer, we get a little paranormal activity, like voices, gushes of wind, the usual non threatening stuff. But last summer something EXTREMELY out of the ordinary happened and I have no explanations for the phenomenon. 

It was the beginning of fall, and my best friend was sleeping over. We share my bed, which is immediately below my room window that leads on the cemetery. I almost always sleep with my window open, this information will be important later. 

We set off to sleep, curtains closed. I was just casually waiting for my sleep medicine to kick in, kind of listening to the noise from outside mindlessly. That night it seemed like someone was dragging something. But I was so relaxed I didnt even notice the actual sound. I immediately noticed it was regular and started falling asleep to it, enjoying the cold wind of the outside like usual.

Suddenly my best friend just cradles up to me and grabs me really hard as if she was scared; so I ask her whats happening, 

«  Cant you hear it? » she probably said, to which I replied «  its just people outside, the window is open. »

She stays quiet for a few seconds still holding me and then she said the most chilling thing she ever said; «  No, bae, the window is closed. » 

Now mind you I bolted up super confused asking her if she was sure, I checked qnd the window was indeed closed. 

My question here is about the actual noise we heard; it sounded like a dragging clinking noise, really like a chain dragging on the pavement. And it was regular. It was getting louder and louder. 

Is there a particular name for this type of apparition? Why was it a clinking chain?"

She frantically called her friend and told her these things, the specific things she said in call is unknown. the police found bullet holes and other evidence that suggested there was a shoot out, but they found no blood anywhere, despite her saying she shot one in the face, her belongings were found on the roof and she's been missing ever since. my initial thought was that she had a run-in with the men in black.

t3_eboyza,all_ads,The night I was visited by a dark entity.,Thetruthishere,"This event happened this past summer ‘19, while I was house/dog sitting for my aunt and uncle.

I was called into work my 2nd night being there, normal since I was working on call. I returned home at about 11, the moon was bright and the sky was clear. 

I went upstairs to the room I was staying in, I laid down for no more than 10 seconds when I decided I was going to get some water. And that’s when I saw it. 

With the bedroom door open and the moon shining through the window I could clearly see the outline of a large figure just outside the door, so tall I couldn’t see a head, just a dark outline of a large body figure. 

I froze. Rubbed my eyes, and looked up again to see it still there. My mind raced, wouldn’t the 2 big dogs downstairs bark if this were a real presence? I stared for a few seconds longer before saying f*ck it, that things not real it can’t hurt me. Even it its a ghost, who cares. I threw the covers over my head and slept best I could and was undisturbed. 

But when I got out of bed the next morning the hair on arms and neck rose and I got chills, even now as I write this reliving it. Right outside the door where I saw the figure were wet footprints in the shape of a quarter moon. From the bathroom to the doorway, perfect full “C” shaped footprints in water... or something. I smelled it, no odour. I looked in the bathroom for any signs of water and nothing. I hadn’t even been in that bathroom since I was there. 

I told my aunt and uncle that day when they got home and they just kinda said, “yeah, some weird stuff goes on around here.” 

Was this a demon? I haven’t really been one to believe in that stuff but I cannot explain what that was and how water made its way into footprints that reminded me of bull prints."

t3_eblcps,all_ads,The girl at the end of my bed,Thetruthishere,"Up until I was eight years old, I lived in a ramshackle small cottage in the countryside throughout the 1980's. Two small children raised by a single mother who worked long hours as a nurse. The place was always falling apart because it was a very, very old cottage (at least a 100 years old) with a thatched roof. A narrow, steep staircase led from the front of the house to the next floor, at the slight landing of which, my door sat with my bed facing the door. Thus I could see anyone stepping on to the landing after the last step.

&amp;#x200B;

I have several vague memories of what I am about to recount, but I struggle to believe them even now. But I'm told I would often talk about the sad, little girl that would come into my room and sit on the end of my bed at night. What I remember of these events is waking up various times to see a light on at the bottom of the stairs, except it wasn't the normal light. Rather a dull greenish yellow, I remember it growing brighter and brighter as it moved up the stairs. And I remember seeing the hem of a dress switching past the door. At this point I was always terrified in the times I could remember, and I would throw the covers over my head and pretend to snore loudly (don't ask me why, it was moronic). I would see the light from beneath the covers fill my room, and then the memory always ended the same way. I would feel someone sit at the end of my bed. I have no memory of a girl or anything else I would apparently talk about sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is easy to dismiss, trust me I would even now. Except for a few things. Firstly we'd often hear someone running around the house when no one was, slamming doors, even hearing a child's laughter (I remember a lot mum's friends were scared when they'd hear). Again, not very compelling. Then there's my grandmother. She came to visit us one time and in the middle of the night came downstairs for some water. Apparently she turned around to find a girl standing in front of her in the darkness, a girl that was not my sister. She woke everybody up with her screams.

To this day she refuses to talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Years later, I looked into the history of the house and apparently a young girl died there by falling down the stairs. Do I believe in ghosts? I really don't know, but I hope for her sake that they aren't real. I posted this after coming across this subreddit randomly. Thanks for listening."

t3_ebdyak,all_ads,Was my old house haunted?,Thetruthishere,"I’ve shared my experience somewhere else and I’m sharing it here too:

First I apologize for any mistake I’m going to make in my typing because English is not my first language)

Before me and my family move to a newly built house, we used to live in a 25 years old house (maybe older)
I had 15 years of childhood memories in there, some normal and some are scary.

I’ve seen a shadow on the wall moving towards the kitchen when I was a kid (no windows in there and completely impossible for car lights to cast someone’s shadows on the wall from the nearest window (the window was in another room) ) then my keychain which was a plastic skull thing which had a button and if you had to press it, it’ll play a laughing sound was turned on for no apparent reason(the keychain was on the fridge)

I thought my brothers were messing me with me but it was 2am and no one was there.

And my mom usually saw people moving out of the door and she said she saw my father or brother going out but when she asked them they said they weren’t home at that time.

And as a kid I was afraid of going into the yard at nights I always felt as if something is chasing me there (maybe normal childhood stuff?)

We renovated the house later, the number of strange stuffs were reduced but never ended, my mom used to have bad dreams about the people she knew and all of them turned true after a couple of days or on that very same day. 

I used to hear a glass closet door being shut (my father built a closet with a glass door but he removed it after a few months and made it a normal wooden door) so I heard the sounds when there was no glass door, and the sounds came exactly from the bedroom where it used to be.


I always had nightmares of being in a dark place with everything in slow motion  (I rarely saw the dream when I got older but I saw it once days before going to the new house) 

And once a piece of bread and salt was found out of nowhere in our rooftop (there was no way for someone to throw that up there because it was a 3 storey house.) and in my country’s culture it is believed that bread and salt is a tool of witchcraft.

So fast forward the other two freaky things happened to me was that one night I heard screams from outside(it could be my imagination)

But the second one wasn’t my imagination, I was on the second floor alone watching tv around 3pm (I was around 15 years old at the time) when I heard a demonic laughter coming out of the bedroom, I immediately ran downstairs and waited until my parents return (I never told them because I was too scared to talk about it with anyone and I thought if I don’t tell anyone, it wouldn’t happen again."

He began to stumble home (he was drunk at this point) and by this time It was really late so he was the only on the path that led to his trailer.

As he was walking, he began to hear someone whistling up ahead. Puzzled at first, he continued to walk until he saw a man, whistling, as he was walking towards him.

When he got closer to the man, he realized it was a friend who he had served with back in Vietnam.

Bob shouted out to him, wondering why he was in Louisiana because the last time he saw him, he was still in Vietnam. Anyway, they chatted with each other for several hours until both of them had to go and the friend telling him to take care of himself...

I don't remember how he found out but eventually, he got the sad news that his friend had passed away at the same exact moment he was talking to him.

Bob passed away in 2008."

t3_eazyjb,all_ads,Unexplainable scary entities,Thetruthishere,"Hi guys! So I was browsing this thread reading everyone's stories until I remembered one of mine paranormal experiences. It was a few years ago when I was in high school. I was visiting my godmother. Her lungs were in a really bad state, she was sick all the time and had pneumonia after pneumonia. We were in bed that night watching tv before going to sleep. She had a large bed and I was sleeping next to her because she was sick so I can be there if she needs anything. We turned off the TV and went to sleep. All of a  sudden I awoke and was overcomed with dread. Then the television turned on by itself. The remote was not near me or my godmother. Then I looked to her side of the bed and I kid you not, there was something like a black dog standing there. It had black shiny eyes. I was completely stunned. I took my phone to distract myself and it went away. The next morning my godmother told me she had an awful nightmare about a black dog. Also, after a while I was in her apartment, alone. I saw a shadow pass through a corridor. I went to check after a while and the light which I firmly remember I left on in the kitchen was now turned off. There was a constant atmosphere of negativity and dread. After a year and something all those things stopped happening. 

Does anyone know what those things were? And how did it all just go away all of a sudden? Are those things attracted to negativity?"

t3_ebfwyb,all_ads,"Has anybody else seen the ""rake""?",Thetruthishere,"Long post, tldr at end. Definitely worth the read though.

My friend and I lived out if town, maybe 30km (18 miles) from the nearest town. One full moon night, we invited a friend over for some beers, we went out into the woods for a walk because we were bored and suddenly the friend we invited over says ""fucking run boys!"" and sprints off back the house. He said it in a genuinely scared voice and it was heaps spooky out there so we kinda just jogged back to the house in fear. When we got back he said he saw ""the rake"", we didn't know what it was so he showed us a picture of it off the internet. We kinda just shrugged it off and got on with our night. The next weekend my friend and I were having some beers on the balcony and we saw yellow, glowing eyes staring at us from the woods, so we went back inside. That's all that happened that night. Every now and then after that weird stuff would happen occasionally at night, the power got turned off and we heard scratches on the windows, and we'd hear weird groaning outside and then the dog would go nuts barking and sometimes yelping, which was odd because nothing really happened on our property. One night when the dog was going off my friend and I checked to see what was going on, we opened the back door and we saw a bald, grey, lanky humanoid creature with pitch black eyes. It instantly ran off on all fours immediately after we made eye contact. This scared the shit out of us and confirmed what happened to the friend we invited over. For weeks, we'd try to catch the creature on camera to show our friends why we were so paranoid about it, they thought we were going crazy. We saw it a couple more times but never had the camera on us. So we made a plan, we invited the friend who first saw it over on a full moon night, grabbed our machetes and I had a kitchen knife, and we went out into the woods to go kill the thing. We saw it maybe 20 minutes into the hunt and it ran off, we tried running after it but it was so quick, quicker than any animal we'd seen. This happened several times but we were determined to catch and kill the beast. Our search led us deep, deep into the woods, we were lost, but we kept going. We start hearing the groaning and my mates dog takes off into the shrub, we hear growling and barking and then his dog starts yelping heaps bad, we ran after it and saw the rake up close, it has his dog pinned on the ground with it's hands around it's throat, but yet again when we got close it took off into the woods. At this point we went home.. We decided to not fuck with or look for the rake after that. I now live in the city and haven't been bothered by it since.

Tl;dr we were stalked by the rake and it attacked my mates dog"
t3_eb4lrd,all_ads,Mysterious apparition sat at the end of my parents bed,Thetruthishere,"This took place when i was a kid, when i was on a holiday in Crete.

So on the night before i was leaving, i woke up in the middle of the night to a slurping sound. I immediately sat up to see what it was. I saw a masculine figure drinking from a wine glass. I assumed it was my dad and turned to go to sleep.

But i didn’t

That moment, a door opened in the room. It was my dad coming back from the toilet. 

This happened ages ago and i only thought of this yesterday as my mum messaged me to say that a similar experience had happened to her as she had gone to holiday in Crete again that immediately reminded her of my experience ( i told her ) except this time she turned over to see my dad lying next to her.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences in Crete, if so, please could you mention them in the comments

Has anyone"

t3_eb4afu,all_ads,Is this real? Looks quite real. Need your opinion/debunking based on experience or proof. No guesses.,Thetruthishere,"First of all, sorry for my english. It's not my native language.

Second, i would like to see your opinion on this video, if you think it's real or not:

https://youtu.be/2JawPAdLv8k 

Also, why do you think it's real or it's not? I don't want to encourage any guessing. These guys are for me quite new, and they seem legit.

I am very skeptical in regards of any paranormal or unexplained photo or video ""evidence"". Be it ghosts, monsters, aliens, UFOs etc. There are not many and most can be easily explained or debunked. Also, it's rare occasion where i can see a real deal coming from someone being experienced in paranormal field.

Now, to this video... For me, it's quite strange idea using spirit box. Let's say ghosts can communicate on certain frequency. If i understood spirit box correctly, it's rapidly switching radio channels and this is hoping to catch (any kind of) spirit talking. If i was a spirit, i'd find this frustrating. While i was saying for example: ""I don't need your help, i'm fine."" The spirit box would catch only word ""help"" leading investigators to believe i am being captive in the house or wherever.

Another strange idea is to see investigators telling spirits to do certain things. Move this, turn off that, close the door, etc... First, these entities are not your servants, second, why would i do what you are asking me to do? I can keep quiet for whole of your visit. Or do random stuff if so... You would have to be in right place at the right time.

And this is what is for me the most relevant proof. Unexpected things happening... And people getting it on cameras.

Please let me know, what you think? Should i continue watching these guys, or do you have any information they are fake as other shows?

TL;DR: I have my opinion and doubts, but would like to know yours."
t3_eb0u3k,all_ads,Felt like a rat or giant bug or something just woke me up,Thetruthishere,"So this is my first time ever using this subreddit, but it just happened and I need to share it somewhere.

Basically I was just sleeping on my side, when suddenly it felt as though something jumped up on my arm on my blanket and moved very fast right up to my shoulder/neck. Once it got to my shoulder/neck area it just felt like it was just shaking wildly, like it was having a seizure or something.  Normally this is where I would have freaked out and jumped out of bed, but I could not move. I couldn’t even open my eyes, it was like I had sleep paralysis, all I was doing was breathing in harshly through my mouth. This went on for what felt to be about 3 to 5 seconds or so, and when I finally was able to move, I jumped right up and began looking around for what just crawled all over me. Nothing.

The weird thing is I didn’t have like a crazy panic response that I normally get with bugs and the like. The fact I’m not having a panic attack is freaking me out. I also can’t shake the feeling that this kind of thing has happened before but I forgot any of the details.

So that’s the story of how I woke up today, won’t be hopping back into bed anytime soon. Could this just have been sleep paralysis (I’m flairing it as such because I’m not sure what else to flair it’s as lol)? Or some other kind of sleep phenomenon and I’m overreacting? Let me know!"
t3_eaxe0y,all_ads,Mysterious figure at the top of the stairs.,Thetruthishere,"Coming up to Christmas has reminded me of something that happened a few years back.

My family and my in-laws were enjoying Christmas at our house. It was evening. So, with kids there were 6 of us.

I came out of the downstairs toilet, out of the corner of my eye I saw someone at the top of the stairs. I assumed someone else had needed the toilet and couldn't wait until I'd finished. I walked past the kitchen seeing my wife getting snacks.

Then I got to the living room and everyone else was there.

There is only one way to get to the living room and nobody had passed me. Who was at the top of the stairs?

I did go back and look up the stairs, but there was no one there. I'd like to say I rushed up and checked each room. But I didn't.

It's not the first time I've seen someone lurking. But this was the most memorable and a specific time when I was certain that I could account for everyone in the house."
t3_eahoqm,all_ads,My mom found my sister unconscious,Thetruthishere,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this and it’s definitely not as out of pocket as most of the posts on here, but I’ve always thought it was interesting.

When we were younger, my sister used to faint pretty frequently. The first time it ever happened she had gotten up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and collapsed in front of the sink. Luckily there was a brand new family pack of toilet paper rolls in the corner that cushioned her fall so she wasn’t hurt, but this also meant that it didn’t make a loud enough sound to wake anyone up in the middle of the night. 

Regardless of this, my mom somehow woke up and found my sister while she was still unconscious on the bathroom floor. When my sister faints, she’s only completely unconscious for a few seconds before coming to again, which means that my mom would’ve had to wake up as soon as the fall happened. It’s unlikely that any noise woke her up, because the toilet paper muffled it and my sister was pretty young and small so she wouldn’t have made a very loud crash anyways. My room was closest to the bathroom and I didn’t hear a thing. Also, my parents had their own bathroom in their room, so even if my mom had woken up at the perfect moment by chance, there’s no reason she would’ve needed to go outside her room to the kids’ bathroom. 

Mom describes it as mother’s instinct and claims that she suddenly woke up for no reason and just had a feeling that one of her kids was in trouble. She went to check on us and saw the bathroom light on, and that’s when she found my sister. I’m sure there’s a million other explanations for this, and maybe my mom did hear some kind of thump and didn’t register it in her sleepy mind, but I think it’s interesting and kind of sweet to believe the “mother’s instinct” version"
t3_eaj9bx,all_ads,Unknown figure woke me up?,Thetruthishere,"This isn’t a big one but I thought I’d share it anyway as it’s been on my mind recently. This happened a couple months ago. For some context, my mom works a night shift at a manufacturing factory in town. She works from 11pm-7am and regularly gets home at about 7:40am.  On days I don’t have work or school I’ll occasionally wake up when I hear her come in through the front door of the house since my bedroom window is right next to the front entrance. It was one of those days except this time I woke up to her opening the door to my room which she does from time to time if I don’t tell her I have a day off and thinks I slept in. My door is pretty loud and creaks so I immediately sit up to the sound of it. Half annoyed I mutter “what do you want?” as I stared with my eyes half closed towards the door and see a dark silhouette in the half opened doorway peering in whom I assumed was my mom. I rub my eyes to get them to open properly but realized that my door wasn’t even open at all and that it was only 7am and my mom wasn’t even home yet. I was still alone in the house. I brushed it off as a really weird dream and went back to sleep and the rest of the day continued as normal.

I have no idea who/what it was and for some reason I wasn’t initially creeped out until I thought about it again later and told my mom. All she told me was make sure I lock the doors properly!"
t3_eaok7k,all_ads,Out of body experiences and seeing shadow people,Thetruthishere,"This was about almost 2 years ago when I was 16 and didn’t think much of it but I was reminded of it today and it gave me the chills.

I went to sleep one night normally only to “wake up” but I woke up in almost like an alternate body. I “woke up”, looked down at my bed and saw myself sleeping there and I got terrified. I remember trying to wake up and move but I couldn’t. I turned my head around to look out the window (I sleep next to a window) and see an all black but very well defined man with no face or eyes walking towards my front door and I get this crushing feeling that he’s gonna attack me. I remember jumping out of my bed and running to my room door, which was open although it was closed in real life, and getting to the front door, which was also open in the dream but closed in real life, and I began to fight that figure against the door trying not to let him in but he was gaining on me until all of a sudden the door slammed shut and I woke up in my actual body.

Another experience I had is a two parter somewhat. In one dream, I remember seeing a red eye peek through the creek of my door. This dream only lasted about a minute but I remember seeing it as if I was awake but I wasn’t? It gave me a really uneasy feeling but I ended up going back to sleep that night. 

Few nights later, I get another experience where I was like a camera in my room and I was watching myself sleep from a heightened perspective and had a complete overview of my room but I wasn’t an actual person or a body.. I was just like a head or camera or something. Anyways, as I’m experiencing this, a dark figure with two red eyes (the same eyes from the creek in the door if i recall correctly) slowly opens my door and walks over to my sleeping body and stands and watches over it. This goes on for about 2 minutes until I start feeling uneasy and thought to myself that I wanna end this and it ended soon after. The figure never did anything. 

These type of experiences has never happened to me again and I’m really curious as to why I had them happen around the same time of each other, I would say I had these in the span of maybe a month or two."
t3_ea8kea,all_ads,Illumination,Thetruthishere,"To this day, I don’t have an explanation, but I’m glad I wasn’t alone in the experience or I’d think I was totally insane.

I was camping in Northern Ontario along the banks of a beautiful lake. There was a dock that spanned about 20 feet over the water’s surface, and the perimeter was full of brush and forest. My best friend and I were the only two humans present, stargazing and talking about everything and nothing.

What happened next is burnt into my memory. It lasted less then a full second, but in the midst of our conversation there was a deafening crack. All at once, the world was illuminated as if it had suddenly become 12 in the afternoon as opposed to 12 at night. It was blinding, but each intricate detail of the wilderness around us was suddenly visible.

And then darkness.

The conversation halted, stiffened by the shock of what had just been experienced. Slowly, I turned to my best friend as if to silently confirm that she had just seen the same thing I had. The look on her face said it all.

We both quietly retreated into our tent without speaking about what we saw until daylight the following day. I don’t know if what we witnessed was some kind of supernova? Or if it was a different kind of otherworldly experience... does any one have any insight?"
t3_e9szjf,all_ads,We met a missing person on a camping trip,Thetruthishere,"Been lurking here for a few months, but decided to tell my story finally. 

My family and I were from Oakland, CA. It was 2012, and I was 16, my brother was 12, and my parents were both in their mid 50s. One summer we were on a road trip, and ended up camping in the mountains above Lander, WY. I remember sitting in the back seat behind my dad who was driving. We were on a dirt road above Sinks Canyon, and all of the windows open. It was July and very nice out. 

We pulled over by the turnout to one of the lakes to the right of us to look at the map. My parents weren’t sure how to get to the campground on the other end of the several mile road. About this time, a young lady came jogging from the other direction. I remember she was blonde, had on a yellow tank top and dark shorts. My dad waved out the window to her and called her over. 

He explained that we were lost and asked if she knew the area. 

“Sure do! If you keep following this,” she motioned towards the road in front of us, “it will take you to Louis Lake. The campgrounds are going to be on your left.” 
We thanked her; she said her name was Amy. 

Anyway, a few years later, I saw an episode of “Disappeared” that featured a runner who had gone missing in the late 1990’s outside of Lander, WY and had never been found. When they showed her name, Amy Bechtel, and her photo, the hair on my neck immediately stood up. It was her! When we saw her, she appeared the same age, and was wearing the same clothes described in the program! 

I showed my dad a few days later, but he didn’t remember the specifics that I did. He remembered her being named Amy, but thought I was imagining things. My brother was asleep when this happened and my mom had no comment. But 5 years later, I know what I saw. 

It was Amy.

Edit: for clarity, grammar."
t3_ea1ala,all_ads,Why do we remember some one-time encounter?,Thetruthishere,"I meant, did you have a single encounter with someone and still remember it 20 years afterward whereas nobody have seen the person you talk about at this very moment?

Sorry here, bad English.

It happened in 1998, in France. We were invited to celebrate Christmas with my aunt (mother's sister) and I saw someone, a young blond man, wearing a bright blue shirt standing in front of the fireplace. There were a lot of family then, so I thought he was just a sibling I did not know about. 

I did not saw him for the rest of the celebration. 

11 years later, I talked to my mother about it and this man looks like my late cousin, who committed suicide. Apparently the aunt we were at for Christmas in 1998 hears whispers sometimes. 

I am 30 now and I still think, well, this is weird."

t3_e9zuv3,all_ads,Shadow figures or entities plague family property,Thetruthishere,"(Very long post ahead.)

Getting this out there while it's still fresh in my head. This was told to me by my mom who had just spoken to my aunt on the phone some hours ago about weird occurrences on their family's property.

Additionally, all of my mother's family lives on my grandfather's property in the mountainside in Mexico State; our vacation home included. All of these experiences happened to different family members spread out in a timeline over a few weeks.

The first encounter happened to my uncle C. His wife and kids were away on a retreat while he had gotten home from work and was ready to sleep. He said that while he was sleeping, in his dreams he would get flashes of a shadow like figure lurking around the house. He immediately woke up to check the house, when he saw a shadow figure walking around his house and run towards the main door. Thinking someone had broken into the house, he ran to the door and saw that it was wide open. As he went to go slam it shut, he looked outside and saw a figure he claimed looked like a distorted woman but immediately gave him goosebumps and he knew it wasn't what it appeared to be.

About a week later, my other uncle A, had gotten home from work at night and was relaxing and drinking a beer outside, when he noticed a man standing still on the dirt path that connects all of our houses. I should also mention that we have built a very small open church behind my house and perpendicular to the rest of the family houses. He was watching this man and was getting scared so he called my other uncle F on the phone, to come outside with him in case it was a mugger or burglar. When both my uncles were together and started approaching the man still standing there, they said the man bolted and ran inside the church and out. Now past the church is a large fence with a grassy field with junk beyond it. When they approached the fence to look into the field they didn't see anything but shortly after heard all the stray dogs howling and whimpering. This scared them and they ran back to their homes.

The final encounter happened about another week afterwards in which one of my aunts who was home alone cleaning the house suddenly felt fear and looked around the house when she noticed a shadow figure inside her home as if watching her.

All of these encounters were separate and during different days but were later communicated to each other in hopes of figuring things out. My aunt also said that even currently at night they'll hear the stray dogs whimpering and crying as if they're afraid of something outside.

t3_e9tcyy,all_ads,What was it???,Thetruthishere,"This story is hard for anyone who didnt see what happened to believe. Sometimes its still hard for me to believe. But im hoping someone on here can relate or explain. About 3 years ago i was in my hometown with some friends and it was around 12 at night. We were near these soccer fields in our town, there was 6 of us packed into a vehicle. 

We were at the top of this hill that overlooked the soccer fields and at the edge of the fields was thick tree line. As a group of kids about to head to college after that summer you can probably imagine what we were all doing there at that time of night. This is one reason nobody believes any of us when we tell them what ALL 6 of us saw.  

Anyways im in the middle row of seats and we are all talking, laughing, just doin our thing. All of a sudden the two people in the front start to freak out. And i mean like panic, scared kind of freak out. They started saying we should go they saw something really weird in the treeline across from us. We all laughed at them and blew it off and continued what we were doing. A couple minutes later the two people next to me start to  also say they saw whatever it was in the treeline. At this point im getting nervous too i still hadnt seen what they were talking about. I asked what it looked like. 

They told me it looked like a big blue person. I laughed so hard i thought my friends were all in on some trick to make me scared or something....But then they made me keep looking where they had seen the entity. About 2 minutes passed and as we sat there in silence waiting, i saw it. 

Across in the treeline what looked like a transparent yet solid blue being slowly stepped out of the trees. It looked like there was energy flowing through its human like body. It was a light yet bold blue color. The entity had to be 7 or 8 feet tall. We all confirmed that we were seeing the same thing and described it to each other. The being stood there for a minute and then turned around and went into the woods. We waited there in disbelief for a while before deciding we should get out of there.

I tell a lot of people about this story in hope that one day someone will believe what happened or give some sort of explanation"
t3_e9ut0i,all_ads,Do you believe some people could be cursed?,Thetruthishere,"An example I'll use to illustrate my point may seem petty but it's actually a microcosm of the way I feel my entire life has been.

You're tagged in a photo on social media, doesn't matter the person, doesn't matter the time, the place, ect - THAT photo with you in it gets less likes than any other photo they've ever posted.

My buddy mentioned this to me, he said ""Man, my mom was saying that she feels like she gives off a bad energy. That anytime she is involved with something people seem less interested"" and then he brought up the instagram example.

That is me but x100 and he feels this way about himself as well. Things just don't work out, they never do. Someone tells you ""I've had bad luck with my last relationships"", you've never even had a girlfriend. ""I'm not happy with my career, it doesn't pay well"", you don't even have a career.

Now before I am told that this is just poor social skills or laziness, lack of desire to achieve the things stated above... it's not that. I have no hope in life because I always remember wanting to get ahead and things just didn't click. Ever. Things just never worked out. I actually feel as though I am cursed.

One last example to sum it up because it's so hard to explain. It's like an undertone of life that's so subtle but effects EVERYTHING. So imagine a viral video you saw that got millions upon millions of views... and then you had some way to go back in time, upload the same video, with the same tags, with the same title at the EXACT SAME TIME and no one would ever see it. It would get 2 views and never be seen again. That's how I feel. There is just a vibe of bad luck, ""You're not meant to be successful"" type of feeling. I'm just not meant to be anything and it feels as though a force is holding me back. As though I am legitimately cursed."
t3_e9tcc4,all_ads,"""But... We ARE your leader."" Why I believe extraterrestrial beings ARE our true leaders. Hear me out now...",Thetruthishere,"So The Drake Equation says that there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations JUST in the Milky Way galaxy alone. And besides our little galaxy, there are a hundred billion-- I'll say that again, A HUNDRED BILLION other GALAXIES in our observable universe, it seems to me that the math would have to conclude that it would be an impossibility there aren't at least SOME old-ass aliens. 

I mean, wouldn't you agree that there's gotta be at least a couple who've been around for millions, if not billions of years? I'd say maybe even more than a couple. Dare i say hundreds? Who's technology is so far more advanced than ours that we can't even comprehend it. Like maybe, programming at the atomic level. And sure, if that's the case, they might have gravity-manipulating transportation for interstellar travel that would seem like straight up magic to us. 

So. If you conclude the likely hood of there being at least SOME old ass aliens who's intelligent lifeforms have been around for millions or billions of years, and can travel through galaxies as fast as we can travel through countries, it stands to reason then that some can, and most likely have, observed us. (I mean, if we found a new island here on earth with new species of animal we didn't know existed, we would want to observe, gather data, and possibly do some expariments, would we not?) And if they've been observing us from our beginnning, and have the technology to ahnialate us, why haven't they? 

One might theorize we pose no threat. They probably look at us like bugs and they have no reason to murder us. This theory would suggest they knew about earth before it even had intelligent life, so if they wanted our planet they would have taken it a long time ago. (Or maybe they did.) Remember also, there are ""theoretically"" so many other civilizations to observe. They probably want us all to thrive as long as we don't do anything too stupid (the atom bomb was a dumb idea, we should have been vaporized for that one... Interesting that UFO sightings skyrocketed around when those were created... Ughh. Climate change is a good one too, shit.) 

So if we are saying all that is true, and you also believe these things (as I do). The Roswell crash was a huge cover up job, and actually the American government's (maybe mankid's) first modern contact with aliens. In my opinion, it's fair to say that major governments have been in communication with some of these extraterestrials since at least then. Not to mention the fact that people constantly report seeing UFO's all the time, all over the world. Am I taking crazy pills, or is it plain OBVIOUS that they are just zipping all around us, observing, testing, and taking samples -and we act like we don't even notice. Are you thinking ""Nah, man. All those people are lying, all the 'evidence' is shopped or hoaxed"" -i get that, but what evidence would you except, short of the government coming clean? But imma go ahead and say, I think the aliens are probably dumbfounded at how naive we are.

So why don't the aliens come down and be more OBVIOUS about their existence? 
Why won't the governments admit we are in contact?

Here's why. If some aliens have been around for like a hundred million years, I'm sure they developed some kind of code about living beings and not interfering with the development of life forms unless absolutely necessary. And if we the people found out we actually have alien overlords who, although they seem to mean us no real harm, obviously have an enormous upper-hand and could vaporize us in the blink of an eye? Chaos would insue. Lots of people would become ultra paranoid. Groups of people including some politicians could form who would demand that we at least prepare to protect ourselves from, if not take shots at the aliens, neither of which we can even BEGIN to try and do! Neither the governments nor aliens would want that result. 

THERES NOTHING OUR GOVERMENTS CAN DO about the super-advanced beings who over see us. If we had an advancement of technology with extraterrestrial help, we could maybe end up with some hokey scientists who could try to expel some kind of alien weaponry and cause a rift between our kinds and disrupt the peace we are maintaining now! Idiotic politicians everywhere would call for a war against the little grey men! 

So FUCK NO they're not gonna tell us about it! There's not SHIT they can do about it!!! That's not an answer they can give us! And now that its been this long without telling us, who could ever believe their government again about anything if they did? It could be anarchy.

Well, now I've been seeing shit about Antarctica. The fact that you can't explore most of it ..youre not allowed to, but also, you really just cant. The terrain is impossible for humans. You can't fly over it, it's not owned by any country...  WHY?? What better a place to have an alien base or headquarters?? 

The truth is stranger than fiction. 

We are YOUNG intelligent beings. Scientists are always learning new shit. Think of all the shit we thought we knew in the last 50 years that we now know was way wrong. If humans had a million more years then we've actually had to thrive and advance? We already know some seemingly impossible shit exists. Super-massive black holes, grey matter, particles acting differently when being observe, etc. Safe to say what we minions still don't know would explode our tiny fucking minds. Just my opinion tho. 

Please debate. Tell me why all or part of my theory makes no sense. Please. I wanna hear why you disagree. I'm getting paranoid!"
t3_e9xl16,all_ads,My Cousins Murder?,Thetruthishere,The law has changed their story first claiming he was murdered then claiming he overdosed. He went missing and was found 12 days later in a field. We couldn't ever get a straight story from the law &amp; the medical examiner wouldn't speak with us. They gave us the report at the door of  the facility saying he over dosed and nobody spoke with us they just handed it to his mom &amp; walked away. Then 6 months later we get a medical examiner report saying the investigation is still open for homicide.  So we don't know what is going on. Nobody will tell us anything. Google: Austin Long found dead in Hallsboro NC and it will pop up. In Columbus County NC. Read the whole story if you like.
t3_e9ue0k,all_ads,I saw signs in the sky and dreams before my dad was killed,Thetruthishere,"Only person Ive told this is my mom. Pretty new to reddit and saw this subreddit. felt like sharing my experience to see if anyone has experienced the same.

couple months before my dad passed away. I was taking pictures  and videos of the sky because I loved the way the clouds were shaped that day. Later that day I was deleting pictures and videos off my phone to save memory, When I was looking at the cloud pictures I immediately saw this human shaped figure facing me. So I zoomed in the picture to see it better and sure enough behind the figure I saw small human figures what seems like they were going up some stairs, bieng guided by a man in a robe with a goat tee,  the detail in the picture is astonishing because you can see his robe, cap and goat tee and his face, nose outline etc. Theres a guy in a hoodie walking up some stairs and what seems like a lady looking back down. You can see more figures walking up the stairs on the cloud. I followed the stairs and where they were going and all the way to the top theres a dark figure, and what seems like an alien . There is also angel figures around there. I took a video which is only a few seconds  since at the time I didnt see it the figures , i just wanted to get a clip of the sky. and in the video you can see the first figure I saw. I call him the ""gate keeper"" Since he seemed taller than the others and was at the bottom like guarding them.

-- At the time my father wasnt living with us. and a few months after I saw the cloud people, I had a very realistic dream of me and my family in the living room spending time. It was me, my father ,mother and siblings. The vibe in the dream was really intense, that when I woke up I had the urge to tell my mom to call my dad and see how he was. I didnt tell her and went on with my day about a month later my mom tells me my dad was killed ... I told her my experiences and she sees the people on the clouds too in my pictures and videos. and she believes I was getting signs too. To this day I regret not telling her to call my dad. Maybe something couldve prevented him from bieng killed. Like moving out the area etc. 
I'll leave a link to the pictures, i made a video on youtube.

t3_e9943m,all_ads,"My great-great-grandfather never heard of aliens, but swear he saw little men in the forest coming out of big rotating plates with lights.",Thetruthishere,"This happened around 1900's, in the country side of south Brazil. My grandmother's  grandfather was coming home from a ball (the parties they had on the early days) very late at night. He lived in a small farm, and so to come from the party place he had to walk a long way in the middle of ""nothing"", just trees and bushes and well, you can imagine how the countryside of Brazil was back then.

He told that while he was walking, all of a sudden he heard strong noises and lights. Scared, he hid behind bushes to see what was happening. He said there were very little men speaking a language he could not understand, and behind them, huge plates stacked above one another with lights all over them. He stayed hiding and praying in the bushes until they left. He ran for his life after that.

My grandma says she heard this story a few times in her youth from him. Always the same narrative and him praying after. Only after she married, moved to the big city and had children was when she heard people talking about these ""Alien"" things. And all so similar descriptions to what her grandfather told her.

She is a very religious woman who only believes in what the Bible says, except aliens."
t3_e9i29z,all_ads,'Dream Invader'?,Thetruthishere,"I wanted to share this experience with you all and see if anyone has had something similar happen.

A couple years back a friend and I were backpacking in Bears Ears National Monument, and area rich in archeologic sites of the ancestral pueblo peoples. After a day of hiking and exploring some of the sites we came across, we set up camp a bit away from a cliff dwelling site, and went down for the night.

Nothing out of the ordinary happened during any of that, we're both archeologicists, and knew how to properly visit the sites. I woke up in the middle of the night after a strange dream, and heard my friend stirring as well. The dream spooked me a bit, but I went back to sleep.

When we woke in the morning the first thing he said was that he had a super weird dream, and started explaining it. He said that the entire dream world was full of flames, and a chill went down my spine. I interrupted to ask if there was a shadow man beating the drum and he just stared at me kinda dumbfounded, and said yes. We went on to describe our dreams and they were practically identical - a tall shadow of a man, beating a loud rhythmic drum beat, with flames engulfing him and everything else.

Needless to say, that spooked us and we quickly packed up camp and cut the last day of our trip short and went back to our car. I have no idea what happened or why we had the same dream while never discussing anything of the sort prior. To us, it definitely felt like a warning that we weren't wanted in the specific place at that time. Love to hear any opinions or similar experience!"
t3_e9m273,all_ads,A MYSTERY RELATED TO LOVE,Thetruthishere,"I was fourteen years old. My sister two years younger used to bring home some of her classmates to do homework together. That afternoon, my mother had been urgently required by a neighbor, so she left me in charge of ironing the clothes she was forced to interrupt. Soon my sister arrived accompanied as always by a friend. I informed her out loud that our mother had left, she acknowledged receipt of the notice and went to her room. But her friend did not follow her: intrigued by that masculine voice, she followed its trail until she found me in the room where I was ironing shirts. Since I was on my back and focused on my task, I did not notice her presence until she greeted me with a ""hello"". I turned a little startled and saw her standing there, watching me. I barely had time to react because my sister immediately came to the rescue of her friend. In general, I did not like my sister's friends, but this one was different. Not only did I like her, but I felt as if a spring had jumped in my memory. In a word: I felt a surprising familiarity towards her, as if I had found a loved one after a long time. I did not hide it from my family: during dinner, I commented that I really liked my sister's friend, which generated joking reactions like ""Go, finally you like some of her friends!"", ""Miracle!"".
Here the story is interrupted to retake it ten years later.
In all that time, I had not seen Blanca (that's her name) or known about her. I worked at that time as a scriptwriter on Televisión Española.
One evening, I came back home by bus when I saw her in the distance through the window. My heart skipped a beat because I recognized her immediately. But I recognized her not as the girl who had briefly passed through my family's home ten years before, but just as I recognized her that afternoon: as someone very dear, for whom I felt a strange familiarity and confidence. It was a little later that I realized I had experienced that same feeling ten years ago and that she was the same girl. (This experience sparked my interest in the theory of Soul Mates and, when I noticed that there was no book that thoroughly traced the origins of this theory, I decided to write that book myself.) It was the hour people left work, the traffic was intense and the bus moved slowly, so I had time to observe her. She had just left the Conciliar Seminary, where the future priests were preparing, and she was chatting animatedly with a friend. I do not know if it was the expression of surprise on my face what made her stop suddenly and turn to stare at me, also with the same expression of surprise.
The next day, I asked my sister about her old friend and I found out she was preparing to become a cloistered nun and that this had been her vocation since she was a child. Among other considerations, that made me desist from contacting her. I thought that such an ingrained vocation was too beautiful a thing to be ruined.
A year passed.
I was visiting my sister's new apartment. She was busy in the kitchen preparing dinner while I took off my coat in the living room. Then an open envelope called my attention on the mail tray; the address was that of a convent of Poor Clares.
The next Sunday I took a train and I stood at the door of the convent church with the intention of attending mass. I had arrived an hour in advance, but the door was open and I wanted to take a look. The Church was in gloom and I saw no one; but suddenly I heard a greeting from one of the sides. I turned around and there she was, lighting some candles. She was dressed as a nun, wearing a white novice headdress, but once again I recognized her immediately. My plan was to attend mass with the hope of seeing her, but without her being aware of my presence, so I stepped back and left the church with my heart beating strongly. To reassure myself, I went for a walk among the vineyards that surrounded the convent, and at the time of the mass I returned. This time there were many parishioners gathered in front of the church. I was among the last to enter. I sat on the side, discovering with satisfaction that, as I had foreseen, the nuns were present. They occupied the first two banks, which allowed me to contemplate Blanca without her seeing me. I thought with joy that, as long as I lived, I would not stop attending that mass every Sunday. However, an unforeseen event occurred, which is that Blanca went out to read the first reading of the Gospel. There we were again face to face, our eyes met ... My intention to pass unnoticed had been frustrated.
However, I did not stop going to my ""appointment"" every Sunday. But, as the weeks passed, our peculiar relationship based on looks of complicity, was becoming more and more evident. Then one day I received a letter from the mother superior of the convent asking me, for the sake of Blanca, to stop attending mass in that church. Since then, more than twenty years have passed and I have not seen her again.
But seven years ago I suddenly felt the urge to make inquiries, and I learned that, along with the other nuns in the convent among vineyards, Blanca had just been moved to another Spanish province, to a centennial monastery in need of young nuns to relieve the old ones who occupied it. I applied for vacations and again took a train, this time with a farther destination. I was again in front of the church of that centennial convent. Again I opened the door slowly ... but suddenly the emotion took over me and I was not able to enter. I returned to Barcelona after a few days, sad because I knew I would not see her again, at least in this life. But I remembered that she was always joyful and had a blind faith in the bright future that awaits us all at the end of our pilgrimage on Earth. So I recovered, and now I am joyful, waiting for that luminous future in which I also believe blindly.

t3_e9lxh8,all_ads,FROM DESPAIR TO HOPE IN AN INSTANT,Thetruthishere,"I am going to tell you my (let's call it) secret history. It may not seem like much to you, but I assure you that for me, that I have lived it and live it daily, there is something strange in it, something that does not fit with the materialistic and logical vision of the things that reign in our days. You will see. 
Three years ago I was diagnosed with a disease I had suffered since I was a child but which I did not know it was a disease. I simply suffered from it believing that it was part of my way of being. This disease is called ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD for friends). When my mind is not occupied in something, it chooses to imagine terrible scenarios, that cause me panic because I  judge them possible. I know it only depends on my will. But unfortunately my will has its own opinion about it and it seems not to depend completely on me. As a child, I imagined with terror that I was unable to walk ... and was paralyzed. If I heard about the dangers of rising blood pressure, I panicked and I myself caused a rise in tension. At school, I imagined being rejected by my classmates, and unconsciously, unable to avoid it, I managed to make myself unbearable in their eyes. When I think of any risk, I put all my effort to provoke the damage I fear. I thought that I should hate myself for some mysterious reason and that I wanted to kill myself. 
By the end of my studies, this state of affairs had simply become unbearable. I could not live like this for the rest of my life, I told myself, and I thought it would be convenient to shorten it as much as possible. I was (and still am within my limitations) a devout Christian, and suicide was a great sin, I believed. However, after a fierce internal struggle, despair won the battle. At that time I was studying Law, but I found it insipid, and since I had been very fond of reading and writing since I was a child (it was the subterfuge I found to avoid my uncontrollable self-destructive thoughts), I decided to give myself one last chance on behalf of that hobby of mine. I talked to God, as I used to, and I said ""Look, I can not stand it anymore; if you don't give me an incentive to live, I'll give up."" And then I remembered the literary contest I had participated in recently, and I did something terrible: I ""blackmailed"" God, I gave Him an ultimatum: ""If I win that contest"", I said, ""I will have an incentive to keep fighting"". 
In the meantime, I began to make preparations for my discreet leaving through the back door, because I had no hope of winning. But I won. And that, you know, was for me an epiphany, it was like the confirmation that, when I ""spoke"" to God, I did not speak alone. When one ""discovers"" that God exists, he feels himself with the strength to fight against everything, even against himself if he is against him. So that was the turning point. The conversations with God became more frequent and coincidences began to happen that would be risky to attribute to chance. Among them, the one that struck me the most was encountering the girl I had met ten years ago, when I was about thirteen years old and my sister came home in the company of a classmate, a girl whom I fell in love with at first sight. 
But that's another story."
t3_e9zrwy,all_ads,"This happened to my mother in 1984, and she's been dead ever since",Thetruthishere,"I forgot all about this until about three or four years ago when I was silencing my mind to the beautifully warm embrace of peaceful meditation; suddenly my mind was cracked in half with the image of my bedroom door on that day in that house.

I was probably six. Maybe five. Could've been seven. I was in that house. It's one of those homes that chews your soul with a near soothing control as you bleed out onto your own serenity. A slow leak of a bleed. Metaphoric bleeding, of course, but this is the metaphoric bloodshed that makes you smile at your reflection one minute, only to cry out in anger, disgust, pain when you discover many years later that the wound is there and splatter-fucking the blood to your soul all over everything peaceful with accents of poetically artistic poise providing your spirit with a zaggidy contrast. A contrast that roasts the turkey much faster than the ham. Hurts your soul to dream of. But--fuck it, bruh--tie the ham to the turkey, and you suddenly have an edible wonder that speaks: ""Put some dat gravy on me bitch ass, mothafukka!"" And of course: ""Eazy does it!""

For the simple person who fails to see the various hues, illuminations, shades, and smears this amazing life grants us each and every day of our simple, yet very fair, passage onto the other side, here's how this funky shit goes down. FUNKY SHIT! There my bitch ass is: that's me meditating to some guided meditation my fine as fuck ass found on YouTube. Look at how relaxed I am. You can tell my fine bitch ass is getting into to this shit. Now, look, you see that shit? You see me twitch like a bitch touched me dickhead? That's the vision of the door from the angry ghost poking me. Still inside me. Still walking behind me. Just letting my motherfucking ass know that it knows that maybe I forgot and now it reminds me so it knows that I know that it did happen in that house.

I'm a child. Five, six ... seven--don't fucking matter. I'm sitting on the floor, all crisscross applesauce back in the 80s when we called the shit this: Indian Style. I think I'm playing with Matchbox cars. Just playing with them. Playing with those toy cars in that house. The type of house that doesn't allow you finish a thought years after the fact. That house. This is one of those houses that stays stranded in the fear section of your essence.

I'm sorry. It wasn't a big deal. But it touched me that day in that house.

Okay. Here goes: I'm playing with my cars on the carpet in my bedroom. The door is ajar. Suddenly, it starts slamming! OPENING! CLOSING! A burst of something not right. Because, you see, it was the house. That house that slices open a man's safety gem and laughs as all comfort spurts from the wound.

The house is winning. That's it. I'm fucking done with this shit. Why!?!? Why can't I just write that I thought it was mom. But I was a lot freaked out. I needed it to be my mom. For whatever reason, she was the only other person in that house. I knew it had to be her. I stand. I go to the door. I push past it into the quiet hallway. I walk down that hallway in that house and to the living room, and I find my mother. The vacuum hose is jammed down her throat. She's twitching. Not a lot of blood, but her face is discolored, and--God, forgive me for saying this--she looked pathetic. I pulled the hose out her mouth like it was a dead fish. Mom died. My life changed. I have the vacuum's hum in my brain. I know I saw that vacuum jammed into her face. It was the worst image I've ever had. Her lipstick was smeared on a little piece of it.

It happened when I was nine years old. It turns out that I embarked with my classmates on a scheduled excursion to enjoy a day in Nature. The place where the bus school left us was a large lawn with picnic tables and attractions for children. I remember a spring of limpid water frequented by the people of the environment because of its healthy properties. However, what attracted me the most was the dense forest that flanked the meadow and climbed up the mountain. So, moving away from the ball-shaped missiles that were already beginning to swarm through the air, I slunk down a path that went into the forest. I certainly enjoyed my venturing into that exuberant plant and mineral kingdom that so few times had had occasion to tread until then. But the afternoon began to fall, and so the hour of return approached. So I undertook a rapid descent in the course of which I lost myself. I understood that I was descending the wrong slope, and I was scared. I got so scared that I knelt down and, putting my hands together, I started praying. I had not finished yet when I heard footsteps approaching. I got up ipso facto and then I saw three or four young people appear among the trees, descending peacefully down the slope. Kindly they asked me if I was returning to the bus school, and in response to my affirmative answer, they told me to follow them. On the way, they asked me if I had been kneeling praying when they found me, but I felt ashamed and I denied it. We arrived at the lawn just as my companions were starting to get on the buses. You can not imagine the relief and joy I felt! No one had noticed my absence, and when I wanted to thank my saviors, I could not find them. I remember how, from the window of the bus, I looked unsuccessfully at the contours in their search..."
t3_e9dkrp,all_ads,There's always an explanation... Until there isn't....,Thetruthishere,"Copied from a previous post:

Sorry for the read. But worth it IMO...

This story is 100% true. I swear on my life. 
I unfortunately cannot proclaim the experience  to be of supernatural origin, but I will tell you the story as it happened to me so you can decide for yourself.

My grandmother's house was built over -what we believe to be- a Native American burial ground on tribal land. We know this, due to its proximity to a holy mountain in a semi-rural part of Arizona as well as numerous human skeletal remains that have been uncovered over the years from our backyard. There have been hundreds of strange occurrences in that house over the years that have been experienced by a good majority of my family and as such, it is generally accepted without hesitation that the house is, in fact, very haunted. Uncle's, cousins, grandparents, friends - everyone, has had some sort of odd experience there ranging from seeing an actual apparition to things flying off the counters at night. 

I lived in my grandmother's house for a few years in my early to late teens and would often experience a whole spectrum of different odd occurrences at all times of the day. Loud explosions no one else heard, feelings of being watched, white figures moving across windows late at night, loud footsteps on the roof that were often heard by everyone else in the house that upon investigation could not be explained, so on and on. Being the natural skeptic/pessimist I am, I would generally disregard these as my imagination or some other sort of freak occurrence such as attempted burglaries, magnetic interferace or auditory hallucinations - bottom line, I always had an explanation... No matter how obvious it was that I did not.

One evening, my uncle, cousin (Pops) and I were watching ""Silence of the Lambs"" in the living room when we heard what sounded like someone choking or suffering from some sort of asthmatic attack from down the hall behind us. At first, I believe only pops and myself heard the noise as we both looked down the hall to where our grandparents were sleeping in order to identify the sounds source. After it ended, we turned back around in complete silence to continue watching the movie. The noise began again. My uncle decided to pause the movie this time and we all stared down the empty hallway to my grandparents room. Just as my uncle was about to eject himself from his seat to walk down the hallway an investigate the sound, it began to move towards us. 

The sounds of someone's panicked chocking moved towards the living room, circled both couches went into the dining room, finally ending in the kitchen. In total, the experience lasted around 10 minutes or so. We all sat there in complete silence. No one spoke a word of what was happening as there was really nothing we could say about it. 

At one point I remember the sound coming from as close as 2-3 feet away from me and I distinctly remember it sounding from about the height off the ground that a 5'6 - 5'8 man would stand, had there been one there. I remember looking it up and down as it was occuring. There was nothing there. No flying insect, no animal, nothing. Absolutely nothing there. 

The odd part was that despite a recent death in our family, I had absolutely no recollection of ever hearing anyone in our family breath like that. It sounded distinctly female was accompanied by no other sound. I didn't feel cold air, I didnt feel chills... None of the typical ghost feeling stuff you read about in stories. Honestly, I didn't even feel the least bit frightened about it for whatever reason. I can only assume it was because I was so convinced that it was some sort of trickery, that I didn't even consider it to be a supernatural phenomenon.

Regardless of it's exact origins, we all heard and experienced it that night. Oddly enough, the significance of this event really didn't start to sink in till years later. I still reach out to those that were there that night to confirm it actually did happen and that it wasn't some sort of elaborate prank.

Thanks for reading!

t3_e91q52,all_ads,Vivid dreams seem like other lives,Thetruthishere,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes;

I have always been a vivid dreamer but it’s more then that. I feel like I live entire lives in my dreams. I wake up and I remember every detail. I have even been able to put myself back into dreams for multiple nights in a row.  I wake up feeling completely exhausted when I have these type of dreams and it takes me days and sometimes weeks to shake off the feeling of loss that is associated with leaving the dream. I’m not sure if that makes sense but the best way I can describe it is like when you are really invested in a wonderfully written novel and its characters and then the book ends. You miss them and you miss the places that have come to feel familiar and comforting.  
I rarely have nightmares or even negative dreams. I think I’ve had maybe 5-7 my whole life and I’m almost 40! The dreams are almost always pretty normal and mundane and I can remember tons of details like names of people, street names, color of cars, sounds and smells.  I’ve spoken to friends and family and so far no one I know can relate.  Is this lucid dreaming or a form of it?  I feel like it’s something different because some of the dreams tend to not be possible in the current time line. 
I will note that I have had multiple scans of my brain due to feeling exhausted and actually developing a stutter and some other neurological issues due to the fatigue, and my scans are normal. 

Maybe I’m just a super intense dreamer but I’d love any input anyone might have!  If this is the wrong place for this post any guidance on a better sub would be greatly appreciated!"

They look mind-numbingly scary, they talk to me, touch me, drool on me, breathe hot breath into my ear. You know, real sweet dreams.  

A couple of months ago a particularly scary demon creature was moving down the hallway towards my bedroom.  He was huge, he filled the hallway, he was black and asymmetrical, lumpy and muscular, sharp with fangs and claws. I just couldn’t take it, so I tore my soul out of my body, It truly felt like I had an out of body experience. 

When I say I tore my soul out, I mean it. It was incredibly hard to do but I was just so scared. I sat up on my elbows and pulled and pulled, almost like my backside was stuck on a glue trap. Eventually, I got out. I looked back at myself as the hell beast was leaning over my physical body but I wasn’t in there, it was just a shell. I moved into my kitchen and waited it out until the hallucination was over. When the air lightened and the static cleared, I joined my body once more and jolted awake. 

I’ve never had much opinion about whether the soul and the body are two separate entities, but I felt them split. I shed my skin suit and was free."
t3_e92xvk,all_ads,My Aunty is a psychic medium,Thetruthishere,"My Aunty told me she could see dead people as a warning when I first moved in with her. I already knew that she had a bunch of miscarriages in the past but I didn’t know how many until I moved in.

She had been pregnant 8 times before she finally had her first baby but she named all her children that she lost. I remember one day she told me my cousins were going to come over and spend the night. 

Now I’ve always sort of believed in the supernatural because I come from the islands were a lotttt of supernatural shit goes down (myths/legends/etc). But this was the first time I ever experienced anything of the sort. We stay in a 2 storey unit with the bedrooms and bathroom upstairs and the kitchen, living room and front door downstairs. After about 6pm I started hearing footsteps upstairs and my Aunty tells me that they’re here. 

We were home alone that night, just me, my Aunty and her baby. She went upstairs to use the bathroom which is right next to my bedroom and I hear her start to yell saying “no boys allowed in this room, only the girls can sleep here” she yells a bit more and then comes back downstairs and as soon as she’s off the staircase I just hear my bedroom door slam shut so loudly the wall shook. 

I couldn’t see them but I had this weird feeling like I was with all my baby cousins. You know that feeling you get when your at a family reunion or something? It was kind of like that. 

They didn’t do much though. Just run around upstairs and turn off the tv a few times. They were gone by sunrise. It was a weird experience but now I fully believe that my Aunty can see ghosts."

When I was about 15 I was hanging out with my friend, Richard. His family was having their annual family cookout and they had it at some park I’ve never been to. It was your typical family cookout, so pretty boring stuff. Until Richard’s cousin Cindy showed up. Trust me, if you were a teenage boy you automatically liked Cindy. We were pretty much the only teenagers at the cookout so it was just us 3 hanging out for the most part. 

Eventually we went on a walk and got carried away just talking about random stories. We were deep in the woods across from the park where their family was. That’s when we came across an abandoned house right in the middle of the woods. Just the sight alone was enough to make any normal person turn the other way. But apparently 3 teenagers thought it would be a good idea to find a way in. 


Surprisingly the front door was cracked open a bit, which should have been a warning sign. But we took it as a welcoming as we entered easily. The place was dark and the first thing we noticed was the trash bags all over the floor. I mean we could barely move around because of how many bags were all around. It definitely added to the creepiness about the house. 

As we looked around the open area there was one thing we saw that stood out. On the rusty stove was a toy troll. One of those trolls with the long hair and the jewel in its stomach, or whatever that thing was. I don’t know why but it gave me goosebumps just looking at it. I felt almost like it watching us as crazy as that sounds. 

We checked around the main floor of the house and basically the place was empty and dark. Then we saw the stairs that led to the upper part of the house. Now I can assure you that we checked all the rooms on the main floor. Bedrooms, bathrooms, closets, all empty. As we started to head up the stairs, Cindy stopped us claiming that she saw something moving down the hallway. 

All 3 of us backed away and looked down the dark narrow hall that we had recently just been through. We watched as a red balloon with a string attached, appeared out of the darkness floating towards us. I don’t think the balloon itself is what creeped us out. It was the way the balloon was floating. 

It would slowly drop down, then float up, then move left, then right. Still moving towards us, down...up...left...right. There were no windows open, no gusts of wind. Something else was moving this balloon I 100% believe that. It moved in this pattern until it passed us and bumped into the wall. 

We started heading towards the entrance door that we came in through. We made it out safe but the whole way back I had this eerie feeling. It just didn’t make sense to me. We checked the whole first floor. That house was trashed and looked like it had been abandoned for years. How did we miss a red balloon, how was there still a balloon with air in that house? Why did it move that way?"
t3_e8d1dh,all_ads,My brother knew about an earthquake before it happened. Has anything similar happened to anyone else?,Thetruthishere,"I posed this on another subreddit and didn’t have a good response.

In 2010 a massive earthquake (8.8) hit Chile. My brother was living there during on a church service project. Some weeks before it happened, he was convinced there was going to be a “destructive earthquake”. He even wrote my sister 12 days in advance saying he was sure there would be an earthquake and how he was already prepared for it. He told her to specifically not tell my parents so they wouldn’t worry.

Before the earthquake, some people who were part of his service project had dreams about an earthquake happening. So he wasn’t the only one who thought there’d be an earthquake. Two of his roommates thought the same as him.
The leaders of his service project even had a meeting before the earthquake to prepare for the possibility of an earthquake. His service project was for 2 years and that was the only time he had a meeting which talked about a natural disaster. He also told me about weird, small things happening before it happened that he doesn’t believe to just be coincidence. 

Has anyone had any experience with anything similar to this? My brother is a reliable person who wouldn’t stretch the truth. I even read the email he sent to my sister in 2010. He’s never made such claims/predictions of the sort. It’s odd to me that the one time he makes such a claim, it actually happened. We are trying to figure out if it was a spiritual phenomenon, crazy coincidence, mass paranoia, or some human intuition. Also, there were no foreshocks reported for this earthquake that I could find. Any questions, thoughts, or insights are welcome. Very curious"

t3_e8nqyk,all_ads,Late night spooky work goings on,Thetruthishere,"Just read another story on here and it reminded me of something that happened in work last year. My best friend was working a late shift because it was around this time of year and there were sales and stuff that needed to be done when the store was closed. So on this particular night the people working the shift heard major banging on the back door, as if someone was kicking the door, which was weird because it night time and no one was expected at that time. So cautiously he went to check and no one was there. So curiosity got the better of him and he went to check the cameras. The cameras were fine up until the point of the banging were it was just missing, it came back on as my mate was coming back in confused.
A few strange things happened that month. A chandelier fell down by itself when the store was closed and destroyed a table. When the cameras were checked on that and slowed down it looked like an animal on the table. I actually put a video on YouTube of it 75% joking lol I called it demon rat lol. Probably just a loose fixture lol.
Here's the link:

I got scared and thought how I could die any day really, and every day is not a gaurentee so I need to start working towards my goals even if I am young. But it just so happens that Juice Wrld died at about 3AM from a sezuire. I just find it funny how I was thinking about a young person dying from a sezuire the exact moment it happened to Juice Wrld. I don't believe this is mystical in any way- It's just a coincidence but yeah sezuires are a real threat apparently."
t3_e8gevn,all_ads,Strange dream?,Thetruthishere,"Hey guys! I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while, and I hope this is the right place to discuss this, but has anyone here experienced a weird dream where you physically felt everything that happened to you?

Just for some context, some years ago during high school, I had a very strange dream. In this dream, I was about 25(my current age), and I was out at some bar in a sizable city(I’m assuming Los Angeles since I’m out there frequently). I decided to go out into the back, which opened up into a narrow alleyway for some fresh air, and before I knew it, a mugger was demanding my money, and when I handed the wallet over, he stabbed me to death and left me there to die. The oddest part was that I actually felt it, but it wasn’t painful? I don’t exactly know how to describe it. 

Anyways, I thought the dream would end there because like most dreams where you die, you wake up just before or shortly after you’re dead. But this dream had other ideas, because my vision did go black, but then I saw myself lying on the ground in a pool of blood, as my friends came out to check on me and called the paramedics. As a ghost, I followed my body to the hospital, then somehow ended up at my own house where my parents got the news that I was dead, and then I was at my own funeral. That’s where my dream decided to cut off. It was just a very strange dream. To this day I’ve never experienced anything like it, but now I’m hyper sensitive about going out with friends to bars lol.

Edit: I’ve had prophetic dreams before, so I’m not sure if this one was a warning for far ahead in the future, since I was 16 at the time."

t3_e7uz2z,all_ads,My uncle haunts my family,Thetruthishere,"So in July of 2018 my uncle passed away due to leukaemia. After that things had never been the same. At first I wasn’t sure if these things was my families form of grieving, but now, 2 years later I can confirm it is not.

It started off about 1 month after he died. My aunt (and my other aunt &amp; uncle) were finding dimes EVERYWHERE. I know it could have been a coincidence, but I have always been told after a loved one died they can show they are with you by making dimes appear. It was normal spots where you find them either like couch cushions, they appeared in jewelry boxes, kitchen sink, the fridge, under bed pillows, even in glasses that were in the cupboard. (This is the weirdest one yet), My aunt and uncle own a lot of forest property, so my uncle cut down wood for his fire place and when he went to bring it back to the house a maple leaf had landed on the logs with a DIME in the middle of it. No one walks through their forest since its private property so no one had done that or dropped change. 

About 3 months after his death (so approximately October), every night at 3 am the fire alarms would go off. It was so strange, I had been sleeping over at my aunt and uncles house and at 3 am the fire alarms would go off (all of them not just one), and even after taking them off the wall they would still go off. 

While the fire alarms would be going off, all the blue tooth speakers throughout the house would turn on, playing random radio stations at full blast. My aunt and uncle would never listen to radio on the speakers but it would flip to the most random radio stations, some weren’t even english they were Russian or Spanish. Eventually my aunt had enough and yelled “Please stop!” then it didn’t happen for a long time...

It has been two years and a hand full of weird things still happen. I have experienced dimes turning up at my house, and objects (such as cleaning supplies or wakeup) being THROWN off the shelves. I don’t mean falling because they were on the edge, I mean they got air and went across the room. I even specifically remember closing my bathroom door while i was folding laundry in the hallway (I have this weird thing about mirrors in the dark it freaks me out so I have to close the door) then the door OPENED. I was so freaked out since I was home alone and you have to turn the knob to open the door and that happened. 

Meanwhile at my other aunt and uncles house that is where the most “paranormal” activity occurs. Started off with those dimes and fire alarms, but now stranger things happen. My cousin and his girlfriend were sleeping over at my aunt and uncles when at 2am his girlfriend started hearing the drawers in the bathroom open and slam shut. My cousin slept through it but his girlfriend was up all night crying while the two golden retrievers in the house were sitting outside the bathroom door GROWLING (which they never do). 

Now the two golden retrievers my aunt and uncle own growl at the corners, and what seems to be nothing. These are the sweetest dogs that I have ever met, I had never heard them growl, especially like this. My aunt showed me a video of her dog tip toeing into her bathroom growling (teeth showing, all her fur standing up), she was looking at the corner and just growling which grew into barks. It was the strangest thing because this is so out of character for the dog. 
I dont have the video so I can’t attach it here (sorry). 

Anyway, it is scary sometimes, but I guess it is sweet since he is showing that he is with us"
t3_e81zsj,all_ads,Childhood and Youth: Mimics and Auditory Hallucinations,Thetruthishere,"Trigger warning: mentions mental illness and suicide. Also kinda long, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by saying that I don't personally believe that the experiences that I'm about to describe have any explanation beyond childhood brain development and stress, but for those of you who believe, here's are two unrelated experiences:

&amp;#x200B;

Between the ages of 5 and 6 me and my twin brother used have the exact same dreams on occasion. Growing up, we would try to explain it away as having similar experiences or having discussed the dreams with each other... but who knows? Around the same age we would frequently experience auditory hallucinations of our mother or father calling for us. This seems to be pretty common among young children (just read through this sub) - but is the explanation child brain development, or that... something... has a reason to talk to young children? Perhaps something that only children will listen to?

&amp;#x200B;

Much later, around the age of 19 and 20, I had this girlfriend. Nothing weird until we started living together for about a year. She was a sleep talker, and would sometimes sleep with her eyes open, so that was kinda creepy sometimes especially since some of the stuff would be muttering about death and morbid stuff. She would sometimes have conversations with someone in her sleep, which wouldn't have been creepy if they were like conversations with her mom or dad, but no, it was almost always something that you could tell involved the other party threatening her, or someone trying to kill themselves and her trying to dissuade them. Sometimes she would talk to me in her sleep, and on a few times a got the chills because it was as if I was talking to someone else... She would also half-wake up and point-out hallucinations on the walls or ceiling, and would sometimes see things and have very vivid hallucinations even when awake. It was a fun time. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was very much an ""I want to believe"" kind of person, and at this time was going through some mental illness stemming from an abusive childhood, so I'd always take it with a grain of salt, but there are a few unerring coincidences here. This person came from a culture where astrology was very important, and at birth an astrologist's reading indicated that she would be susceptible as a vessel for spirits and such. Her friends did tell me a story about how they stayed at a hotel in LA that was supposed to be haunted due to the unusually high rate of deaths among its guests. There might have been a serial killer too, I don't remember. ANYWAY, in the middle of the night she sat up, pointed at spot in the middle of the room, and yelled ""DEMON!"". In my experience that part was just a normal night. What made this a bit creepy was that everyone had nightmares that night, and had little scratches that they thought they couldn't explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on I think that she started to get to me a little bit: the relationship had started to break down and I had a lot of stress from work and school. But when she said that she could hear whispers, sometimes I could hear them too, or see the figure that she would point out in the dark. I started to have auditory hallucinations like those of my childhood too, but it would be her voice. I've read about similar stuff happening to couples with deteriorating relationships: they have the other person on their mind a lot, and sometimes hear their name (especially their pet name) called from another room. But I've also read myths from different cultures about mimics, bogeymen, and the like that are drawn to vulnerable people and negative situations... so who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

Crap while I was writing this I swear I heard my flat mate and his gf in the room next door, but they aren't here. This place's walls are pretty thin so it could have been the neighbors, but still, I'm gonna leave this empty apartment and find some other humans to be around."

Ew whats in my house? I had to go to bathroom 
and I was watchin to make sure my boy twin didnt put blanket over his head as Id have rushed out.. My 2 yr old Natalie left the bathroom and I thought I heard Brantley yell or scream and our gate to downstairs.. I looked over cause I even thought I seen a glimpse of her going around the corner.. I was so sure she was there that I didn't immediately rush to her (that hall has a gate with a distinct sound and is there to prevent her falling on stairs)... You can tell I was dumbfounded cause I was so sure I had seen her or thought I did?? Can you see anything on the video (I will NOT look over there after this happened I hate my house so bad). She wasnt even in the living room. On top of that before I rushed out to make sure they were all okay.. I zoomed to make sure my son wasnt covering his head and 1. His or SOMEONES arm (seems literally impossible to be my sons arm so this is freaking me out to even think of again and I did not look at footage hard cause I DONT want to see but I need to know if anyone else sees something or anything???)... Also, his little thing I have my twins in started not just going front and back a little but seemed like he would have had to be strong enough to kick it side to side with force AND back snd forth almost at the same time at one point!

t3_e8c8z8,all_ads,i predicted juice wrld’s death (?),Thetruthishere,"before i start telling this story, i want to talk a bit about my de ja vu experiences. 

i have de ja vu everyday, at least once a day. sometimes, when something happens and i get de ja vu, i can remember what happened next in the dream im having de ja vu from and “predict” what’s going to happen next. 

for example, i could have a dream of me eating an apple and then getting a phone call two minutes later. when i get de ja vu from that dream while eating the apple, i could be like oh, im going to get a phone call in two minutes. 

so anyways. about a month ago i had a dream that i was scrolling through instagram on my bed through a Saturday. this saturday, i was sitting on my bed scrolling through instagram, and i noticed that the posts were in the exact same order and they were the exact same posts as they were in the dream. as you probably already figured, this isnt an unusual occurance for me. i started trying to remember what happened later in that dream. i remembered in the dream, that one day later(on sunday) i got news that juice wrld died. i thought, “nah, that wont happen, hes only 21” and didnt think about it until the next day, sunday, dec 8 2019, i got news that juice wrld died. 

as i said before, this isnt an unusual occurrence for me, but i never predicted something as serious as death. this is very unusual. thoughts?"

I said no she says it’s your niece and your grandmas birthday I had no idea if I gave you background on like why I seriously didn’t know this you would say you spoiled trust fund little bastard anyway that’s mostly what I would be sobbing about how selfish I was.. am. Anyway I would right this off as just my subconscious but when I was in 8th grade I had a dream that my grandmas friend Pauley called and asked for my mother I told her she wasn’t there now... I told my mom the next day what I had a dream about and she said you know she died a while ago..

t3_e7pklx,all_ads,Creepy Nightmare,Thetruthishere,"Just want to share this nightmare I had around a year ago. 

I have nightmares quite often, but most of the times they are about people yelling at me or calling me bad names and stuff. There are a few times I woke up screaming/crying for them to stop.

But this particular dream I'm going to tell was very different. That night I was sleeping with my boyfriend in his apartment. I woke up to the light thinking it was already morning. I looked around and noticed that something about the room was quite off. A few seconds after that I realized that everything was flipped, like I and the whole room were inside the reflection of a mirror. (I don't know if this makes sense, I'm sorry I'm not good at English..)

Anyways, I was confused but didn't realize that I was dreaming. Suddenly I turned to the wall and saw a very big mirror. Inside that mirror, the room was like what it supposed to be. But in that mirror, I was a gigantic black shadowy creature. The mouth was very wide open and there were sharp teeth. 

To my horror, I looked down at myself and found out that I had turned into that creature. Then I suddenly ripped off my boyfriend's head and blood was everywhere. 

I woke up screaming in terror. I've never had dreams like this before. And it felt so so real."

t3_e7ke2k,all_ads,Painting on the wall,Thetruthishere,"When I was about 6 years old my mom bought her first house. I’ll never forget that day, mainly because of the first thing I noticed when I walked into the house. On one of the living room walls (taking up the whole wall) was a painting of Jesus. Even at my young age I knew the painting was supposed to represent something good...but looking at it gave me a creepy feeling. 

A couple days later my mom and her boyfriend started painting the rooms. They even painted over the painting of Jesus and I kept asking my mom if something bad would happen since they covered Jesus up. She reassured me that everything would be fine and that it was just a painting. That’s when extremely scary stuff started happening to me and I honestly think it had something to do with that painting. 

Some nights I would wake up to the bedroom and bathroom doors slamming shut multiple times. I remember calling out to Dan (my mom’s boyfriend) and he came into my bedroom. I asked him why the doors keep opening and slamming shut. He said it was because the windows were open and the wind was causing it to happen. I knew the wind couldn’t slam a door shut then open it and shut it again though. 

Another night I remember waking up and having to use the bathroom. As I got out of bed I noticed what I thought was my mom standing in my doorway. I stopped dead in my tracks and just looked at her but she didn’t say anything to me. She just stood in the doorway starring at me. So I just crawled back in bed and turned to my side starting to wonder if it was really her. Our dog was in my bed that night and he started growling. That’s when I knew something wasn’t right. I just shut my eyes tight until I ended up falling asleep. 

One of the last and scariest events didn’t happen until years later. I think I was around 11 or 12 at this point. One of my friends was staying the night and my mom was at the store. We were down in the basement because that’s where the PlayStation was. Eventually we heard the sound of heavy footsteps run down the steps and the laundry door slam shut. At first we made a joke about it. Saying my mom just really wanted to come home and do laundry. 

But once we realized it was too quiet we decided to go check. It had been years since anything creepy happened so that didn’t even cross my mind. We opened the laundry door but nobody was in there. I told my friend that my mom had to be home so we starting walking upstairs. I’d say we was about more than halfway up the steps when we both heard the sound of the heavy footsteps again. This time it was behind us running up the steps towards us. We both jetted up the rest of the stairs and I slammed the door behind me. 

Then we ran outside and waited until my mom got home. After she arrived we checked back inside but everything seemed normal. She tried telling me I was just hearing things but my friend kept telling her he heard it too. She ended up selling the house about a year later and nothing else happened in between that time. But even to this day I don’t think my mom believes me about anything that happened."
t3_e7irxl,all_ads,Hunt at night,Thetruthishere,"About four to five months ago I had visited a place called gold camp up on Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, I went with a total of 12 friends and the plan was to check out the supposedly haunted third tunnel but as the night moved on we decided to further explore the area and eventually saw a flashlight out in the distance we called out to the person/people jokingly and they yelled back to us after some time we said wait there we are coming to you they replied okay... After we arrived in the spot we saw them there was no one there and the person stopped replying to us calling out to them and the bushes around us started rustling so one of my buddies made the call to get out of there claiming it's a set up and just as we were leaving the man called out saying I'm coming my buddy said fuck him were leaving and at that point we heard a blood curling scream and footsteps sprinting at us, we hightailed it out of the area running til we hit half way down the trail and we stopped so another one of my friends stopped to fix his boot, mind you he is the fat guy of the group and we were just discussing the situation when we see him dart past us like a bullet most of the group ran as soon as he did but three of us turned to see why and this thing standing at about six feet tall long arms and large hands with the over all shape of a man was full fledge sprinting at us hunched over that's when the rest of us ran too... Later that night I made some calls and talked to allot of people I trust about it one of my friends said it sounds like a wendigo and my uncle in laws had a similar story in the same place and they described a similar creature to what we saw and thief story made it sound more like a wendigo and it is responsible for their friend going missing... Since then I go back up there with one other friend and we hunt this thing down to find out what it is and if it is what we think it is to slay it..."

t3_e7kiy0,all_ads,A skeleton behind me as I slept as a child,Thetruthishere,"So this is kind of a weird thing, but I used to think when I went to sleep there would be a skeleton behind my head as I would fall asleep.  I didn’t ever think much of it, it was just something that I thought I imagined as I’d fall asleep. I never wanted to move, I always stayed completely still as I went to sleep because otherwise I thought it would get me. 

So maybe it is just my imagination, but I never told anyone.  But I was just talking to my sister about the weird stuff of our childhood and she mentioned that she would imagine the same thing! She never told me this before so it’s kind of weird.

So, has anybody else experienced this or anything similar to this?"

t3_e73r02,all_ads,Curtain appeared in bathroom and wrapped around me.,Thetruthishere,"Has anyone experienced anything similar? Or maybe have any theories? This has perplexed and terrified me for a long time.

I was about 6 years old and wet the bed. I went to the bathroom to finish peeing. I was sitting on the toilet with my head down, sulking. When I lifted my head, there was a curtain between me and the shower curtain. I thought, ""I don't remember this curtain ever being here...It's not even a shower curtain, it's fabric.""

Then, in the blink of an eye, the curtain spread out and wrapped around me. It picked me up off the toilet and squeezed me tightly. I tried running away but I couldn't because it had such a tight hold on me. I could barely breathe. My arms were held tightly against my stomach, so I couldn't even use my hands to try to free myself. I don't know if the curtain was swinging me around or if it was just my own self trying to break free. About 5-10 seconds later, it let go of me.

I bolted out of the bathroom, terrified and hysterical. I woke my parents and told them what happened. I could tell that they believed me but they tried convincing me it was just a bad dream. I knew it wasn't because I was wide awake. They tried comforting me by saying we don't even own any curtains like what I described, but that kinda made it worse. The house used to be super haunted but not anymore. As I got a little older, I started to wonder if someone was killed and wrapped in the shower curtain. It's a wild guess, and I've never heard of any murders here...But why would a ghost or whatever choose to manifest decorative curtains of all things?

Edit: 
Less than a year later, I saw a man's head pop up between the bed and the wall with blood pouring out the top. It spun around as his mouth appeared to be screaming (but no sound). That is what led me to wonder about the murder and wrapping the body in the shower curtain. The man's head would have spun around as he was wrapped in the curtain. It may be unrelated, though, and I am just making connections where there are none."

Dad was 5 years old, camping with his boy scout troop. They sent everyone for firewood, it was dusk, so he went off on his own and a little further than the other kids, he wanted to gather more firewood than anyone else. He got far enough away that nobody else had picked through the fallen wood and started gathering. Along his way he went until he almost stepped on a tiny tribe of Indians, in full regalia, around a tiny fire, singing and dancing in a circle. He said they were 3 inches tall and they didn't pay him any mind as he crouched down to watch them. He looked over their little ceremony for long enough that the scout leader started calling his name, and he grabbed his woodpile and ran back to camp."

t3_e75s0f,all_ads,A light in the dark,Thetruthishere,"So, I wouldn't even say this here if I wasn't unsure of what I saw, which basically isn't a lot and most of the people will say it's just a hallucination or me just waking partially from a dream. It happened last night and I can't stop thinking about it.


 I was alone at my apartment which is on the 6th floor, I was sleeping in bed with my dog when in the middle of the night my dog started like half barking, half growling and staring at one spot, it woke me up and I just thought she heard something outside but she kept staring at the same spot. I didn't give much thought to it and tried to go back to sleep. She continued to do this barking/growling, which wasn't as normal, this one was more like a concerned/curious/something is different growl, not like I was in danger or anything. I decide to get up and pee and as I get up and look at the corner she's been staring at, I see a blue light just hovering above the couch, I only saw it for a split second and without my glasses and the moment I looked at it it dissapeared. I was confused so I looked outside if it was someone's christmas lights or something but there weren't any. I kinda shrugged it off and went to pee but I remember seeing the prints of the light in my eyes after seeing it(like when you look at the light bulb and then look away). After that I just normally went back to sleep, without fear or anything. This entire day I keep thinking about it and it doesn't make sense, it wasn't a reflection of light because all the buildings around mine are not on the level of my floor and no one has blue christmas lights, if it were the cops the light wouldn't reflect of a closet on the 6th floor and the light wouldn't just dissapear the moment I set my eyes on it. It was obviously there the entire time my dog was growling. I came here to maybe see if someone has similar experiences?I never posted or commented on reddit before so it obviously bugs me. I don't think it was somerhing bad or mean spirited otherwhise my dog would go crazy and I would obviously feel like I was threatened. I don't know what it was but it's etched into my brain now. Ever since I was a kid I had these, I would call them feelings, like I knew if something bad or good is going to happen or sometimes I would just know if I am gonna run into somebody, or I have dreams of someone I haven't seen in years then all of sudden the next day I run into them. As I said I don't think it's an evil thing, it would scare me usually but this time I was completely calm and just went back to sleep like nothing happened. Any experience with the blue ball of light, anyone?(although for me it had spikes but that's just my blurred astigmatic vision)."
t3_e6l92e,all_ads,I experienced hitting a dog with my car while no one else did?,Thetruthishere,"I was driving my boyfriend home one night (he was in the passenger seat) and my sister was riding in the backseat. We were in a dark wooded neighborhood when I saw a light colored, lab sized dog sprinting towards the road out of the corner of my eye. I could tell that it wasn’t stopping and that I didn’t have time to avoid it, but I slammed on the brakes anyway. I felt it hit the car on the right front passenger side and I heard a yelp. At this point the car was at a complete stop and I had my eyes closed, I was clutching the steering wheel and repeating “oh my god, oh my god” over and over again. I am a huge animal lover, so I was heartbroken that I just killed someone’s dog.

My boyfriend and my sister were both freaked out and kept trying to calm me down and asked me what was wrong. I was like “I just killed that dog!” They were both confused and adamant that I DIDN’T hit the dog. They both said that they had seen the dog (so it wasn’t a hallucination), but that I somehow missed it or that it had slowed down enough to get by. They didn’t hear the yelp OR feel the impact. 

We got out and searched the area. We never found sign of the dog. There was no damage to the car, no blood, no hair or anything indicating I had hit something. I still can’t explain it. I am partially comforted that maybe I didn’t hit the dog, but deep down I can still feel that sickening bump and hear the sad yelp."

t3_e6p3ae,all_ads,Saw a whole crowd of UFOs with 2 other adults,Thetruthishere,"So I lived in south Denver about 6, maybe 7 years ago, and I went outside to smoke and I thought I saw a mylar balloon glinting in the sun, like, miles up in the air. I focused on it and it turned out to be more than one. The more I focused, the more there seemed to be. And they didn't really look like balloons.
So I ran in the house and grabbed some nice hunting binoculars and focused in on them. 

There were dozens of triangular, shiny metal colored objects in a cluster. I kept thinking they must be balloons, maybe from a wedding, but they weren't really moving-just hanging in the air. And there seemed to be more and more of them the harder I looked. Now there seemed to be hundreds. So I yelled for the guy I lived with.

He came out, and he saw them too. He looked through the binoculars and tried to film them on a camcorder, but he couldn't get it to focus on them and the film just looked like blue sky. He couldn't figure out what they were either. And here they were probably 30 minutes later, still hanging in the same place in the sky.
So he called for his dad. 

And he came, and looked through the binoculars, and he saw them too. He tried to film them on his phone but again they were too far away to focus on. So we all sat there for another hour, just staring at this crowd of multiplying objects high in the sky. They seemed to get further away but they never disappeared. We eventually went inside. I never did rationalize what the objects we saw were. It was almost like we couldn't see how many there were, until we started focusing on trying to see them. It was really crazy and I still wish I could have figured out what they really were."
t3_e78jh8,all_ads,"Blood, death, iron and tar",Thetruthishere,"Over my experiences w death and blood I would like to share these mind numbing facts. Dry blood smells like liquid iron and active welding  (if you know what that smells like).

Fresh blood (especially from the chest, neck or head) smells like liquid metal that kinda burns your nose.
Ik this bc I have experiences with stabbing ppl and busting their skulls open on curbs. 

But when you're the one bleeding (or dieing/think you're going to die) you start to smell a stench of tar and burnt paper. (Also burnt flesh smells like tar)  

When dieing First you'll realize what's happening then you'll kinda get paralyzed and have flashbacks of your whole life (like a movie). Then you'll start to feel weight on your chest, neck and head. After that you'll start to loose your vision and it'll go to clear/white kinda like what you see when you first wake up and have yucky stuff in your eyes as it fades more and more to white then black as your ears ring and start to smell a tar and burning paper which kinda smells like burning flesh then nothing, then an angle most likely a loved one that had already passed away. 

Then if you are revived, you feel a weight on your chest as you begin to gain vision and get then loose a ring in your ear as you begin to realize what had just happened.

This is from my personal experiences some may have different idk.
Anyway enjoy these terrifieing facts  😀"
t3_e6vgyd,all_ads,Banging cabinet doors in the mornings?,Thetruthishere,"So this all happened a year or so ago, kind of a classic little ghost story type thing but it freaked me tf out.

So a little backstory, my dad lives in this newer build house (so no creepy back story), and I normally would get up for school around 8 and the house would be empty. Also it’s an open floor plan so noises carry really easily, just for further explanation.

One morning I had gotten up, and was getting out of the bathroom from my shower, when I hear the cabinets downstairs banging open and shut. My immediate thought was “oh shit I’m being robbed.” So I wait quietly in my bathroom for a while, text my sister, who tells me it’s fine. So I quietly go into my room, and as soon as I’m in there the noises stop. Completely. 

I call my Dad next, who convinces me I probably just imagined it, so I get dressed very quickly and go downstairs. Everything is fine, doors are locked, nothing is missing. But I have a creepy feeling like something is behind me/looking at me, so I book it out of there.

When I get back home and tell my sister about it, she tells me that it’s fine, and that there’s a ‘ghost’ but that he’s nice, and he watches her sleep and doesn’t bother her??

I’ve had a few weird incidents like this in the house, like footsteps on the stairs, but that was the first time it was something so noticeable and freaky. Also my friends that I’ve left at the house to run errands and such have said other weird things to me like that. A few even refuse to stay at the house alone, because they feel a weird energy. 

I know most of the stories on here are a lot more intense with visuals and such, but to me that was enough to send me running. 

Anyways, since there’s no creepy history and the only other thing that happened around this time was a bout of SERIOUSLY ‘bad luck’ type events, should I be convinced this all is settled? Again no experience with other worldly things, just wondering if ghosts or whatever it could be, go away on their own?"

t3_e62wsp,all_ads,My 21 year old cousin was killed in a car crash by a drink driver. The dream I had 2 days after his death is the strangest thing that has ever happened to me and I have had a lot of unexplained things happen,Thetruthishere,"So as stated above my cousin was unfortunately killed by a drink driver 2 years ago.  

2 days after his death I had a vivid dream, myself and my cousin were in a desert surrounded by a group of friends (I could put no faces to the friends but in the dream there was a warm feeling that they were our friends but no one specific). 
The dream would then change to me sitting on a wooden walk way with fishing gear waiting for my cousin to arrive but he never showed up. 
The dream switched back to the desert area and there was a bus, I had this overwhelming feeling and panic that he was on the bus and that I had to stop it from leaving but the bus left and I didn’t manage to stop it. 
I then looked over my shoulder and he was standing behind me with a big beaming smile on his face and then the dream ended. 

The whole time I was in this dream a song played in the background, it was like a theme tune to the whole dream. The song was engraved in my mind relentlessly the whole next day, the song was Green day, Good Riddance (time of your life).

A few weeks passed and I attended his funeral, I sat down with my family, picked up the prayer card and started to look through pictures of him. On the front of the prayer card was a photo of him with a massive beaming smile, just like when I looked over my shoulder in the dream. 

We were not very close as we grew older, he moved away and we both had different lives so I didn’t know any of his interests as he got older. Turns out he was massively into fishing, loads of pictures of him holding fish he had caught which would explain me waiting on the lake with fishing gear for him. 

The strangest thing was the ‘fair well’ song that was listed on the prayer card and played as everyone left the funeral, Green day - Good Riddance (time of your life) I spoke to my uncle afterwards and it turns out it was his favourite song. 

I’ve been told that I’m some kind of gateway and that spirits are guided towards me as I’m an easy route for them to make contact. I told his mum and sisters about the dream and they all agreed that he had come to say goodbye and perhaps I was there to pass on the message."

t3_e6cb98,all_ads,Sensed evil in my dream...,Thetruthishere,"Last night, or this morning rather, I experienced something I can’t exactly explain.  I have always approached most things “paranormal” with some healthy skepticism.  However, as my presence on this sub suggests, I have entertained the thought that inexplicable things likely happen to us on an everyday basis, if we’re paying attention,

It started out as a run-of-the-mill restless night’s sleep.  College, relationships, and a copious amount of masterbation/video games have truly left my sleeping schedule a wreck to say the least.  That said, waking up occasionally throughout the night is not exactly out of the ordinary for me.  But last night, it was like a never ending nightmare.  Not in the sense that it was unbearable, but every time I woke up and inevitably drifted back to sleep, I would return to the same dream.  This went on for what seemed like hours until I had somehow broken the chain, and found myself in a different dreamscape entirely.  I don’t remember much of the nightmare that preceeded this moment, but this part of my dream remains crystal clear to me.

I woke up in the country-side.  Rolling hills and grassy plains, not too outlandish given I live in farm town Ohio.  But, the setting was entirely unrecognizable.  The rolling terrain stretched impossibly far, and the unnatural hazy, white light that coated the landscape made me feel uneasy.  It was kind of like being inside of the moon in Majora’s Mask, for my fellow nerds out there.  At any rate, aside from the trees that dotted the landscape, the only other feature I saw was a woman standing before me.  I did not recognize her, the only quality that I can specifically remember is that she was wearing a white gown of sorts.  I’m hesitant to call it a dress, it almost seemed like sleeping attire.  But not anything I recognized, its hard to say but I wouldn’t be surprised if her clothes were from a different time period.  Once I had analyzed my setting, I moved without thinking and approached the woman.

“Shouldn’t you be asleep?” I spoke, not really understanding why.

She seemed to regard me for a moment before replying, not looking back at me.

“I can’t when she’s here.  Sleeping lets her in.”

I can recall the pang of dread that hit me when she said this.  I had absolutely no reason to assume anything was necessarily wrong.  After all, the otherworldly quality of the world I was set in was giving me the slow realization that I was in a dream.  But there was something off, something heavy in the air as soon as those words left her lips. 

I couldn’t stop myself.

“Is she here?”

Without speaking another word, she simply pointed out across the horizon.  As I turned my head to look, my world came closing in.  

Instantly, my heart was full of bile. I couldn’t breathe.  That awful, nauseating feeling of fear and panic.  My vision went blurry.  My ears were ringing.  The impossible sensation of crushing weight pressing in on my head left me reeling.  I didn’t hear “her”.  I didn’t see “her”. I’m not even sure if I felt “her”, but whatever presence was there was evil.  Or, it had evil intent at least. 

And then, it was over.  I forced myself awake, literally gasping for breath.  My head rang from fatigue and... something else. The dream felt so real, the pain certainly remained. My body felt sluggish yet my mind was racing.  I stumbled out of my room, and made a bee-line for the living room couch.  It took some time and an absurd amount of bright, comforting Christmas movies (watch Klaus on Netflix, its great.  Might even scare ghosts away!) but I finally calmed myself enough to ease myself into a deep, dreamless sleep.

Of course, I had to tell my family as soon as I saw them.  I needed to say it out loud, to convince myself that I wasn’t alone.  But, this may have been a mistake. 

My mom, a very witty and bubbly woman, sat in silence throughout my whole story.  Silently nodding or resting her hand on my shoulder in my moments of distress, but otherwise she made no comments on my experience.  Afterwards, to my horror she described to me the woman in my dream.  

At our previous house, when my sister and I were toddlers, my mom had a dream of a blonde woman in a white gown who locked herself in our room.  My mom recalls pounding on the door, begging and screaming for this intruder to leave her babies alone.  My dad had the same dream that night...

They bolted out of bed, busted our door open to find my sister and I sleeping soundly.  Just as they had left us.

I can’t decide if this was truly the same woman or not.  I can’t decide if she was truly evil or not, perhaps the woman I was warned was something this lady in white had tried to protect me from as an infant.  Maybe she came to me to warn me as an adult.  I’m not sure.  All I know is I had to get this out here.  Thank you to all who read this long and rambly tale.  Please let me know what you think, Reddit.


TLDR: Had a nightmare about a lady in white, might be linked to my parents."
t3_e6ci9o,all_ads,Something is watching me through my wife's eyes while she sleeps,Thetruthishere,"This started happening within the last. I can't pinpoint it. I know for a long time it didn't bother me. That being said, my wife and I have been married for nine years. Eight of those years, and one year living together prior to our wedding, she never did this. 

Here goes. I stay up late. My wife tries, but she's in bed by 10:00 p.m., which is fine. But the past few weeks, when I get up from my computer at my desk and turn toward the bed, my wife is staring at me. Only she's not. I mean, she is there with her eyes open fixed on me. But she doesn't seem alert or even aware, and she breathes as if she's asleep. Long. Deep. Breaths. On the brink of a snore.

It's funny, too, because sometimes I see this, and it's so surreal and also the room is dim, that if I look away for a second, when I stare back at her, her eyes are shut. And she still sleeps. So, naturally, I figured I'm just seeing things. So this last week, I've made it a point to not look away once I catch my wife's eyes staring me down from the bed. And I've walked all the way inches to her eyes, and I have indeed verified the eyes are open, and there is nothing going on with my wife. But something is up with her eyes and me.

Any one got ideas or an explanation?"
t3_e6ah4l,all_ads,The Freakiest Thing Happened to me on the Bus,Thetruthishere,"I was on the bus last night on the way home from my cousin's house and I was feeling a little sick. When I got on everything was normal until almost everyone on the bus stood up and sat back down on the other side of the aisle. I texted my cousin to tell him about it because I was freaked out and wanted someone to talk to about it, and he told me to send a picture. I sent him the picture of the bus with about 6 people on one side, and two people on the other. He started freaking out too, and upon further analysis of the photo, I noticed the head a woman wearing a black hat and a blonde braid who was sitting facing one of the men who hadn't moved seats. The thing is, she wasn't on the bus. I double-checked, standing up and looking around to make sure she wasn't there. We hadn't stopped since then, so she couldn't have gotten off the bus, and she definitely wasn't there. At the next stop, there wasn't anyone waiting and no one had signaled for the driver to let them off but the bus stopped and pulled over to the stop. The doors opened, and the bus waited for a while as if letting someone on or off. Thinking back, could the woman in the black hat whom I wasn't able to see have been getting off? If anyone cares enough I could show you the picture.

t3_e66b5e,all_ads,Giant evil butterfly carrying caterpillar...,Thetruthishere,"Ok so here's an experience I went through about 12 years ago that I don't think I can ever forget. It sounds pretty unrealistic and insane but I swear it's true.


When I was 16 I was living with my dad in a condo right next to a mountain in Las Vegas, NV. I've always been an insomniac and it was pretty late in the night (I can't recall the exact time but I'm assuming it was between 1am-3am.) My nightly routine was to chill in my room, listen to music, smoke cigarettes, chat with friends via text and stare out the window. Well this night I was laying on my bed staring out the window when I noticed some ruffling coming from the left of the window.. I halfway sat up to look and see what was moving and then right in front of my window came an insanely large, what looked similar to an evil monarch butterfly, who happened to be carrying a big ass green caterpillar... Now the crazy part is it seemed as if it was trying to force it to crawl through the seem of my window.. I'll tell you I've never been so freaking scared in my life... I ran to close the blinds thinking I was just imagining this whole situation.. as I reached for the blinds it seems the caterpillar was actually working its way inside my window and as I released the blinds it hit the caterpillar and cut it into 3 pieces... 

Now this is where things get even more weird. 
Right in front of this window I had a small TV and TV stand. The window sill had 3 orange marks on it where it seems like blood or goop came out of this caterpillar and it literally dripped down on to the back of the TV and TV stand... And there was a very very strange musky smell out of no where that I can't even compare to anything I've smelt before... I can say it did kind of smell like stomach acid slightly but still different enough from that it can't be compared. I was terrified to try to find the 3 pieces of the caterpillar but after a minute or two I tried anyways. After literally tearing my room apart I could find nothing.. I was too scared to sleep in my own room so I went to sleep in my younger sisters room on her love sac...


The next morning I wake up to my sister screaming as there are thousands of tiny black bugs all on the carpet around and under the love sac, the musky smell has now entered the entire condo.. I'm freaking the fuck out and we got my dad who proceeded to use a vacuum to get as many as he could up.... We went to school and when we returned we discovered that there were still these little tiny spiders around the house but now on the walls and around the ceiling and they attempted to shoot webs at us as we would walk by... They were very aggressive these little fuckers... They lasted for about a week until they all died off... 

I don't know what to make of this situation but it's one that still baffles me to this day. And the icing on the cake to tell me I wasn't completely crazy was that when we moved out about 10 months later I went to throw away this tv stand which was falling apart at this time and the stains from the orange goop were still on the stand and on the wall behind it all this time later...


This is not the last weird situation I've had with a caterpillar either.... 

I can tell you I'm terrified of caterpillars and butterflies now though.... The mere thought of them sends chills down my spine.


Sorry if my post is hectic and a little crazy as this is the first time I'm sharing this crazy moment of my life and my first real post to any forum like this."

My best friend and I were a few days away from our 25th birthday. I just started a new job and was training. I noticed that I was getting a call from my best friend but had to send her to voicemail because I was working. There was a voicemail left, and shortly after that I got a text message from my step sister asking if I was alright. I excused myself to the bathroom because I had to listen to that voicemail. It ended up being her boyfriend, tearfully explaining to me that she had died.

A few weeks later I remember having a dream where I am driving down a road and my friends apartment is on my left. There is also road construction on the left of me and there is no way for me to get over to the apartment. I remember feeling panicked and knowing that I had to get to my friend to save her life. This scene happens a few times and every new time that is happens I am trying to get to my friend to help her but something always stops me and then that happens all over again.

At the end of the dream, the very last time I am attempting this, she says to me ""it's alright. You cant save me. I love you"" I wake up crying because I want her back so so much and I know there's nothing I can do to get her back."
t3_e6bpk6,all_ads,"I have been inspired to write this. Something u/coren0219 said about dreaming about his cousin, I have a very similar ocurance.",Thetruthishere,"I was in the Army and stationed in Germany. One day I got some terrible news from my parents. My father's best friend had died of a heart attack. This was a very untimely death as my dad's friend was only 42 and in good shape. It hit us all hard. I don't talk about death or loss. I think people who know me know that about me. It's never an issue. Some people heal through sharing experiences with close friends and family. Allows them to focus on the life lived rather than the death. I don't do that. I'm emotional, but that's not it. I just feel like I would never have the right words. Either way, my dad's best friend dies, and I'm bummed for months. This is this first untimely death I'd experienced in my life. I was only 21.

Later in the year, I take leave and go back to the states. My first night at my parents' house during this leave, I had a dream. First time I've had a dream like this. It was also the last time.

I'm swimming away from shore. A lake. I don't quite know what I'm doing swimming, but I just go with it because it feels natural and safe. At one point, I realize FISH--one fish at a time--are shooting straight up out of the water. I'm swimming and realizing this, and it's amazing. It was beautiful. 

Treading water now, the fish fall back to the lake, and they're landing in this boat. Seconds later, the boat passes me, and I see my dad's best friend with the most sincere, ""don't worry, I'm okay"" smile I've ever seen. A smile I could never dream up. I think I said his name, but before he could respond he floated by me and the fish kept falling into his boat.

My dad's best friend was a huge bass fisherman. I knew this prior to the dream, but I swear, it has never left me. I don't dream of people normally. Especially not friends of the family. One of the reasons this dream was so profound for me was because I only dreamed it once. It was the only dream of mine that my father's friend was in that I remember. I'm a bit of a skeptic, but I want to believe that this was my dad's best friend's way of letting me know it was okay to stop mourning, and to gracefully say goodbye. Showing me his version of Heaven."
t3_e68xvd,all_ads,4 year old haunted Hotel. Experiences while having Nightshift.,Thetruthishere,"I do have some paranormal Stories to tell.
So I am sorry if my English is not correct all the time. English is my second language so yeah…
I want to start with something current.

I work in a Hotel at the front desk. The Hotel isn’t very old so you would normally not expect something strange to happen. I work in the nightshift sometimes, means completely alone.
My first night when my colleague showed me how everything worked and what I have to do she told that we do have a ghost. She told me about the sliding door at the main entrance opening and closing by themselves… and as she tells me that… The sliding door opened and closed with nobody near that door. But not only at the main entrance also the sliding door at the garage kept opening and closing in the night with nobody around.  Not even the presence detector caught anything… the light in the garage wasn’t on. But still I was kind of okay with it… I love spooky stuff and I didn’t had a bad feeling while that stuff happened.
But one thing did kind of freaked me out. All the other stuff you could have just said it’s the electronic … but one night I heard the elevator “ding” behind me. The elevator just makes that sound when someone on that floor presses the button. But as you can guess I was alone. Nobody around. And the elevator opened and closed but stayed at the same floor. I also took a look if someone was inside the elevator but it was empty.

Also at some days the light in the toilets (also working with a presence detector) went on by itself. And those detectors are not sensitive at all… I can stand in front of them and they need some seconds to turn the light on… So how on earth does it go on in an empty room…?

Once, while going my tour through the hotel I kept my phone recording the entrance. After that I viewed it back and … damn my phone has a bad quality… but I did catch a voice… and a strange rattling sound. At first I thought it’s me but… you can’t see anyone in that video… And if it was me there should be someone in the video but there wasn’t.

Something that also happens often is the light on the fourth floor is going on and off the whole night. That’s something I can see from the reception. I don’t think guest are running aroun in the middle of the night so... 

Also I did saw some shadows in the corner of my eyes but… I don’t see that as a proof … because it’s dark… you are tired… it could be just a trick of the light or your imagination. So yeah…

I do have nightshift again this week… maybe there will be something new … or maybe I finally can catch something good on video… At least I want to try to finde something. If I really am able to find something I’ll update.

In my Instagram highlights I have some videos about my Nightshift. Also the voice I caught and other stuff... If you are curious about that just write me.

This is one of many stories to tell..."
t3_e6cpmu,all_ads,It finally hit me,Thetruthishere,
t3_e60527,all_ads,I think I’m going insane. Not too sure if I’m dreaming or not.,Thetruthishere,"So I don’t really know much about the paranormal but I do believe in it.  Essentially, something lives in my house and watches me constantly, I can just feel it.

This all started like a year ago when I visited my friend who lives on a supposed haunted road in MA (Dudley rd, Billerica).  Some of my friends fucked with some apparent witch graves in an old grave yard, which like... why the FUCK would you do that.  I wasn’t very pleased to say the least.  We also went into a field and may or may not have seen a ghost or apparition of someone hanged.  I can get into that more in a different story since that isn’t the main focus, but it’s just my theory as to why this is happening.

Anyway... ever since then I believe there’s been something or someone in my house.  It’s never done harm, but it’s presence isn’t very welcoming to say the least.  I can feel it during the day but not as strong, but at night... I can feel someone staring into my soul.  As soon as the sun sets and especially when I’m alone, I get a pit in my stomach and feel instant terror.  

I’ve got 3 cats.  When I go to sleep at night they sleep on my bed with me.  Except at random points in the night they all wake up at the exact same time, jolt up and stare straight into a corner of my bedroom for a VERY long time.  That corner always looks incredibly dark compared to the rest of the room and it’s always freaked me tf out.  Sometimes when they wake up they stare at something right next to my bed, right near my head.  Coincidence or not, when I can feel this thing staring at me it’s either A.  Coming from the corner, or B. Right next to my fucking face.  I don’t know how I know it’s there but I do.  I just know where it is whenever I feel it looking at me.  

I would try to ignore this feeling and go to sleep anyway.  However, I almost always wake up anywhere from like 1-3 in the morning.  When I do wake up, there is a man who stands in that corner of my room and just stares into my soul.  He doesn’t move or speak, he just looks at me, and I look right back at him.  He always looks different, though.  Sometimes he looks like the classic devil.  The goat legs with horns... I’m sure you know what I mean.  Sometimes he looks like a creepy man in a pinstriped suit, but it’s difficult to pinpoint his age.  He looks old and wrinkly, but at the same time he looks young and youthful if that makes sense.  Sometimes he wears casual clothes and a hat.  All that I know is that we just stare at each other.  

The thing that really set me off was that a few times, without moving his body or lips he spoke to me.  Like I heard his voice in my head.  I don’t remember what he said but I just listened intently.  Once I saw him move from that corner to next to my bed, but he didn’t walk or move his body as per usual (he is always completely still) he just sort of... floated?  But his legs still touched the ground.  I’m not sure how to describe it.  When that happened I let out a little yelp and he disappeared.  

The only problem with these “encounters” is that I have no idea if I’m awake or not.  I don’t know if it’s a recurring dream.  Every time I see him at night I feel like I’m in a trance, or like I’m hypnotized.  I just feel incredibly tired.  But I wake up beforehand then go back to sleep so that’s why I’m confused.  It’s so real that I just believe it is.  I’ve never experienced anything like this.  I’ve had dreams where I wake up.  Like a dream within a dream inception kinda thing.  This only happens at my house and nowhere else.


EDIT:  So I’ve taken into account everything everyone’s said.  Thanks for that by the way.  I do have a salt lamp and I put it in that corner.  However, I was skeptical of the sleep paralysis thing, since I’ve never had it before (at least I think so) and I could totally move during these events.   But now, I’m certain it’s more.  A friend of mine who was there that night at the graveyard slept over my house the other day.  He just brought up a “dream” about someone staring at him at night.  I didn’t say I experienced the same thing, but he described a figure with long arms and hair that wore a hat, and his eyes were quite large.  He just looked at him the whole night.  Now I’m starting to wonder if other people who were there that night ever see the same or similar things..."

t3_e649c5,all_ads,A premonition or just a coincidence?,Thetruthishere,"So, I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place for this, but I think it’s worth posting.
For some context, about a month ago, my mother was getting a knee replacement. She had been stressed about it, and I felt a bit stressed for her, as she was worried something was gonna go wrong. Also, her father was alive at the time, and about 88 years old. He wasn’t in my life, and my mother hadn’t seen him in years. I’ll explain how he relates to the knee replacement later. 
Anyway, about 2 weeks before my mother’s surgery, I (20f) have a dream about my grandfather passing away a day before the surgery. It wasn’t a nightmare or anything, I just remember that in the dream, my mother got a phone call about his passing. Woke up and didn’t think much of the dream. I get weird or sad dreams like that often, no big deal. Well, that next week, my mother calls me and tells me her father passed away in the night. (He past Friday in the early AM, moms knee surgery was on the following Monday). Immediately I think of that dream, although I don’t tell my mother that as I’m not sure what she’d think. 
So could this have been a premonition? I have never had a dream like this before, that I recall. I had no reason to think my grandfather was going to die. He had hip surgery not to long before his death, and I guess that eventually led to his passing, although I had been under the impression that it had gone well. The only logical reason I can think of for having this dream is I was worried about something going wrong with my mother’s knee replacement. But even then, why would I dream of her father passing? If anything I think I would dream about the surgery itself going wrong, not her father, who I haven’t seen since I was 6. 
What do you guys think? Just a coincidental connection my mind made, or a genuine premonition?"
t3_e65blo,all_ads,My grandfather came to visit,Thetruthishere,Quite a few years ago now me and a few friends were in my house and thought it would be fun to do a ouija board we didn't get that much of a reaction bit of gibberish not much else after a while of this I decided to get a drink when I come back my friends are still going when all of a sudden the glass starting going back and forth in my direction repeatedly so we start asking questions to see who this spirit is and it said it was my grandfather I wasnt touching the glass now I thought how can I prove that it was my grandfather so I thought of something only me and him knew about (back story) when I was a little kid I was a right shit I went to visit my grandfather and he popped out of the room well next to his favourite chair was a pot of coins mostly 20p's in my stupidness i pinched a hand full and left then went straight to the local arcade he obviously noticed and came and got me dragged me back to his house and gave me a right old row but he never told my mam or anyone else So I asked the spirit what did I take from your home now as I said I wasn't touching the glass and my friends didn't know the story and the glass spelt out 2-0-p 😱😱😱
t3_e6440g,all_ads,"Experiences regarding children and ""ghosts""?",Thetruthishere,"My son is 3. There have been some strange happenings, and I wanted to run it by people and see if there is insight somewhere. For the record, I am a skeptic who wants to believe in paranormal, but I just can't seem to talk myself into it. All these things that have happened with my kid are undeniable, but still make me feel like I should be wearing a tinfoil hat.



It starts about a year ago. My MIL went to a psychic, and asked about my kiddo. She was apparently worried because he didn't speak much, and she thought his obsession with rocks was weird. The psychic told her my kid was a ""crystal child"" and to not worry about him. I took it with a grain of salt.



A couple months ago, we were at my mom's house. I was getting the kid a drink, and he noticed some magnets of myself and my brothers in frames from when we were kids. He asked about them, so I took them down and explained who was who. One of my brothers took his life 15ish years ago, so when kid asked about that uncle, I told him that he had died. He asked why, and I just said that people die, it happens to everyone. He asked why some more, and I just repeated everything until he stopped. We have never discussed the manner of my brothers passing in front of the kid (gunshot to the head). A lot of time had passed, so it wasn't really ever talked about and plus he is 3. 



Later, I was cooking and kiddo was with his dad. He started telling his dad about Uncle (brothers name) and how he had died. How he (kid) never got to meet him and that his uncle shot himself in the head because he didn't want to be alive anymore. He also told his dad ""you have to promise"" and left it at that. Coincidentally, husband was going through a depression and had offhandedly commented about suicide.



So..to discuss other instances. He asked me who was sitting on a blanket one day. I told him no one, and he said there was. So I said to ask their name. He asked the air above the blanket his name, and gave me a name that I don't think he has heard before. The next day, kid says that ""ghost name"" talked to him the night before, told him about flying airplanes, and told kid that he was kids distant cousin. Kid would ask for the next week where this person went, because he couldn't find the ghost. Idk about one whole side of my family, nor does my husband, but tracing on the sides we know, we havent found anyone in the military with that name.


Next, he woke up one morning and told me that his grandpa was talking to him the night before, and told him about how he drove a humvee. My dad passed away while I was pregnant, and did indeed drive a humvee in the army. Also, he doesn't call any of his grandpa's ""grandpa"". 


Last one. I picked him up from school a couple weeks ago. He just blurts out from the backseat ""who was (grandma's) friend who died?"" I told him that my MIL didnt have a friend who died. When my husband got home from work, kid asked him about her. He called his mom, and indeed her friend did die the night before. 



Anyone have insight? Advice? Experience? It all just seems too coincidental for him to know this stuff on his own."
t3_e69ut1,all_ads,"Call me devil, but also god.",Thetruthishere,"Hello everyone. You may call me Reaper, as an alias. I'm a male, now in my mid 20s as of a few weeks ago; i have otaku tendencies. For those who don't know what that is, in laymen terms i'm kind of a nerd. It's a good distraction from reality and also good food for thought with thinking about reality.  ...Reality is, much more messed up and much more disappointing then the average-- lets call them...Sleepers, realize. I say sleepers because an estimated 98% of the population are sleeping, like in a dream. Most don't know anything about the ego or that they even have one, let alone basic enlightenment which is the mere opening of the eyes. Knowing that you are just now waking, like getting up in the morning and getting the grog out of your eyes. This will be abit slow for you to understand and keep in mind this is a summary of events.

I am the literal devil's son. And this is my story so far. First let me clarify what i mean by i'm the devils son. I'm his spiritual son, as we share in literal spirit energy. He merged abit of his energy in with my soul, creating a chthonic demi-god. In general major religion terms now, i would be classified as an Arch-Cambion, with the ranking of demon prince. All of that is of course, politics. Many don't even question, because many don't believe God or gods to be real entities. Even those who go to church weekly. Sometimes that's for the best and sometimes not. Angel is the greek word for messenger. As in post man, one who brings a message. And from personal experience they're generally human. Don't trust anything that needs wings to fly in spirit form. In physical form, an absolute necessity but NEVER spirit form. So, Without further ado. I will begin.

I was made this way do to a pact with a red hair witch on mathematically seems like October 31st considering my birthday of june 12th and the fact the veil is thinnest on that day. Whatever agreement her and Nergal--the name of the REAL original devil. Came to, i have no clue. I was just minding my business in Elysian fields, blue skies, golden fields as far as you can see. But also greens, take your pic. It's a place for deceased heros, so obviously i wasn't populated. Infact i don't recall seeing anyone--until that time. I got tired of staring at my blue skies after 800,000 years (found this out later). Being there was like being in a trance of bliss, time had no existence. Anyway, i was walking along a river when suddenly thing man appeared cloaked and stabbed me--then in soul form tearing my soul open. The next thing i recall is a blue light tunnel, jumping in a childs body--couldn't have been more then 2-3 years. He (and i) was watching TV and ironically it was a cartoon of the devil with a pitch fork boiling someone in a pot--i think that was looney toons. Right after that, i ejected and found my proper body in the womb. Red, so much red in a tight space. I could even see the microbes in there...

My biological father died when i was 2, later i found out suspected my mother poisoned him. My brother told me about his last night full of holes from a bat with nails. Corners report said heart attack...

I'm about 4 years old, we live on a farm. I had a dog chase me down the road everyday i got off the bus from school, a big mean guard dog that only didn't like children, adults were fine. My brother crashed  out step fathers car into the bar and we both got it. Only thing is, my sister doesn't recall living on a farm and she would've been about 12. My brother doesn't either. Mandela effect or memory erasure on them as well? 

Age 7 I was pushed into a river by my cousin and drown. I recall sinking the bottom, drowning is quite terrifying at first but then real peaceful. My uncle a Korean war veteran resuscitated me after 15 minutes.  Later that same weekend a bear was found torn apart in ways that made it look like someone took can axe to it and spread its parts all over the woods. While they were talking about it i walked in, looked up to a red hair lady and called her ""mama"". The rest were in shock, they said ""you didn't"". Apparently she was known for witchcraft by them. She was jealous of our mother being able to have children when she could not. Something so petty made something like me and caused all of this.

With in a few months of that incident two black SUVs pulled up and took us away. I don't recall going from where my sister was staying to my new ""foster home"" where my brother was, first thing he asked upon seeing me is. ""What did they do to you"" I was confused and he said it doesn't matter now. Over the next few years i would be beaten up everyday by the older boys as it would make me strong and i was to weak. While tormented during the day, at night i would have what i thought at the time were dreams that i would forget until i was older. Dreams of torture in ways you can't imagine. You name it and i've been through it. I later found they were wiping my memories with one of Dr mengele old experiments that on record, was never finished. Extremely fast moving images that i would think have some type of code in them which allows one to zero out another's mind. ""No more, You're damaging his brain"" the second man in the room said after only a partial memory wipe. During a full scan of my body many years later in the army, it was found i have a hole burned in my brain and the lower part of my stomach looks like its been ripped out.

Ah yes, the army. In reception about 7 others and myself were called for an ""experimental vaccine"". I later found they were trying to cure cancer experimenting on people who either had cancer or were highly prone to. The ""vaccine"" they used was the leishmaniasis flesh eating parasite, they upped our T-cells to super T-cells and hit us with it. Others organs ate themselves, puked up blood all over, one man was bleeding from his eyes and brain. But myself, oh you see this is where i really start suspecting stuff. My eyes turned pure black and my body burned from the inside like it was on fire. I thought it was the vaccine at the time, but that's what Activated such a response. All but myself and one other either went to the hospital or straight up died. Skip ahead a couple years, i'm talking with an army behavior health officer---basically a therapist. She's trying to get me to take drugs and stuff, go to a mental institute after i explain my life to her. Because it broke her weak pathetic ego. She calls in a couple of the NCOs, like 8 of them. Essentially things were said and eventually one of them puts his hand on my shoulder while she's talking. Next thing i hear from the guy infront of me. ""What's wrong with his eyes?"" ""Oh god!?"" Later i found out from one of my squad mates that my eyes had turned solid black again. 

Recovery of memories. As of may last year i came to illumination, also called deification through the life force of the creator flowing through my body making it its temple. It's called kundalini in india and holy spirit the Christians as well as apotheosis to the greeks and theosis to the orthodox. Since then many of my memories have been coming back, some in parts and bits. Some whole. Touching the creator tends to do that when you have to remember every sin you've ever committed. The creator is not ""God"" what an insult to them honestly. Standing near the creator makes one a god, that is the power of 10 million suns, that's as a demi-god. Human souls only have the power of 1 sun. The creator speak through you with emotions and that is all, they speak in emotions. Who many call ""God"" is Enlil one of two of the creators first made. You call Enlil, YHWH and many other names. Just as you call his brother Enki aka jesus in avatar form many names. The two have been fighting forever. POLITICS. Nergal aka the devil. Is ""arch-angel mikal"" btw, The story of Lotan and Yam, it's Nergal who ejects them from the heavens.  ""The beast and the false prophet"", but that was LONG AGO. So revelation only seems to be a retelling of that, UNLESS they're going to be resurrected. The bible is HEAVILY edited to the politics skirmishes. 

After this incarnation, i will be a full god. Specifically a transcendent divine-demon one or perhaps the Prime Evil depending on. I plan on taking the throne of the netherworld for myself, like the true king i am. Then invading the heavens--if need be to put Enki on his rightful throne. Whoever controls the netherworld, controls where souls go after death. I'm the only one who could take the throne, do to the balance in the universe. 

 At present. Human souls have 4 distinctions. 1. They CAN go to heaven with the gods as a temporary demi-god dependent on the grace of Enki. Grace is borrowed divinity. 2. Tartarus aka the pit, abyss etc. That's for the worst of the worst. 3. The meadows, for neutral people who just existed. All they did was live. It's not really bad at all, but one would certainly want to get out of there pretty soon. Purgatory essentially. Elysian fields, As mentioned a place for heros-- the upgrade to this is-- Isle of the blessed. And you had to be reincarnated and do something heroic 3 times in a row."
t3_e5eyy1,all_ads,"Howling man in Skelly, Oklahoma",Thetruthishere,"A few months ago my roommates and I were out taking a drive trying to find fun places to visit.  I'll call them S and J for privacy sake.  S was driving and told us about a playground in Skelly that she used to go to with a friend so we decided to go check it out.

The playground wasn't very special but it was interesting because it was half OLD playground equipment that you could tell had seen years of use and half newer equipment.  While we were enjoying our time there, I started hearing whispers from the newer side of the playground which didn't freak me out because I've heard them since I was a child.  But I called out to J and she and I walked over there.  By the time S joined us the whispers had stopped and we were about to head to the car when out of nowhere a truck came speeding down the road seemingly from no where and stopped at a crossroads about a half a football field away from the playground.  

Naturally when it stopped we all froze in the shadows of the trees trying not to be seen because it was near Dawn and we didn't want to be caught by some random local in case the park had closing hours or what not.

But before we knew what was happening the driver got out of his truck and stood facing the crossroads and let out this sound that I can only describe as a ""howl"" of some sort.  It was deep and gutteral, almost inhuman sounding.  It started out low and then raised in pitch.  The sound only lasted 5-6 seconds at most before he went silent and then made it again...  What really caught our attention is that we were out in a small country town so at night there's a lot of bird and insect noise, but when the driver started ""howling"" at the crossroads EVERYTHING went absolutely quiet.  After it started it's third howl we ran to the car and drive away, we didn't know what we had witnessed but it definitely felt like something that we weren't supposed to be present for.

S and I drove the 45 minutes home and dropped off J at the house only to decide we wanted to go back now that the sun was up.  But when we arrived back in Skelly we were in for a surprise.  First off there is not a crossroads anywhere close to the playground, there was only a curve in the road but we could all remember distinctly aren't a 4 way crossroads under the street light.  Also it wasn't half a football field away from where we were it was maybe 20 feet away.

I know things look different in the dark but it seems like those two things shouldn't be that different at night.

We don't know what we saw out witnessed but we haven't been back to Skelly, Oklahoma since then either."

t3_e5irc6,all_ads,Ghost in the house that shows only to my father,Thetruthishere,"Something weird happens in my house everyday: unopened wine bottles opens, the metal door of the boiler container slams on the ground even if it was perfectly sealed, chairs falling out of the blue, we learned to live with these events because they started happening 5 months ago.

I also have a 6 months old dog that lives in the house's garden, when he was a puppy sometimes he started crying after staring at something that was not there, now he grew up and he still sees something but he doesn't cry anymore, when he sees it he tries to get me in the house and barks at me if I try to go outside, he wants me to stay into the house, then he goes where he saw something and stays there for 5-10 minutes, then he comes back and he lets me know that is all safe and that I can go outside now.
I've never seen what he does in that 10 minutes because as soon as he hears me going outside the house he comes back to get me in.

The other day my father went outside the house and saw a bucket full of water, he used that bucket 1 hour earlier and it didn't rain so there was no explanation for the water, he stared at the bucket for 2 seconds and then it literally exploded in front of him.
He also told me that he has always a weird feeling when he goes to the bathroom at night, he feels that someone is watching him.

Only my father has this strange feelings and the weird stuffs happens only in front of him.

We moved to this house 9 months ago."
t3_e50d49,all_ads,What does it mean if a man as a 16 year old believed the deaths of his friends was a result of a dragon but later in his life he gets therapy and eventually convinces himself there was no dragon?,Thetruthishere,"This is a real case, google the name Edward Brian McCleary if you want more detailed info. in the 60's a 16 year old went on a skin diving trip, and returned alone. when asked what happened he says that a giant dragon suddenly appeared and killed/ate his friends one by one leaving him the sole survivor. The description of the dragon attack was extremely detailed and very horror movie like. 

For example while he was swimming away from the dragon he said he heard his friend Larry scream ''it's got Brad! I gotta get out of here!'' and McCleary heard the agonized ''blood curdling'' screams coming from Brad for what seemed to be half a minute, before silence. 

he would tell everyone this and got a lot of ridicule for it, so he lived as a recluse.

Only one body was found after a long search, there were no injuries on the body, the boy (Bradford Rice) had simply drowned.

http://www.trueauthority.com/cryptozoology/death.htm

i heard a podcast about this case and it said that later on in his life before he died, he sought help from a psychologist and he eventually convinced himself that there was no dragon. What is that supposed to mean in the context of the case?

Edward McCleary died in 2016 - https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/jacksonville-fl/edward-mccleary-6819524

People had been trying to contact him long before that though, to no avail."

t3_e58m04,all_ads,"When I was little, I saw the moon fall out of the sky.",Thetruthishere,"I was with my dad during a boy scout event at our church. I was watching the sky to see if any bats were out hunting and I started looking at the moon. It was around 11 pm when I saw the moon, quite literally, fall out of the sky. It was a crescent moon and it was very bright. It first slipped onto its side like the cheshire cat’s smile and then it simply fell down into the trees. I literally went looking for the moon but it was no where to be found. I told everyone at the event about it and no one believed me. They still bring up “the time the moon fell down” at parties. But I remember it so vividly that I know I did not dream it. I’ve gone digging through weather information from the time of the event. That night it was cool and clear (which I remember) and there was a 0% chance of rain (lol south texas). An interesting thing I found out is that on the night of the event, it was a new moon. So no visible moon should have been in the sky. I don’t know if I’m the only one (at the event) who was looking at the sky when the moon fell, but I’m pretty sure. I still wholeheartedly believe something weird went on that night. Idk if it’s aliens or moon holograms or anything else"
t3_e51d3f,all_ads,Experience While Babysitting,Thetruthishere,"When I was a senior in high school, I babysat for a family friend of ours. I normally didn’t babysit their kid, but their usual sitter cancelled last minute. 

The baby (he) was 1 or 2 years old. Around 9pm I put him to bed upstairs in his crib. I watched tv downstairs in the living room with a baby monitor next to me. 

After a couple of hours, I hear the baby screaming. It was like nothing I’ve heard before or since. It didn’t sound like normal baby crying.  His shriek conveyed a sense of terror so far removed from an infant’s normal emotional spectrum that I instantly panicked. 

I rushed upstairs to check on the kid. I opened the door to find him standing in his crib, holding himself up with one hand, with his other hand pointing at the closet. I gathered my courage and opened the closet, nothing was there. Since his parents would be home soon, I decided comfort him on the couch downstairs. 

10-15 minutes later the parents arrived. Immediately they were rightfully a little put off, wondering why the baby wasn’t in bed. I explained what happened, clearly still a little freaked out.

The mother became visibly distraught and flew upstairs without a word. The father solemnly apologized to me, then asked for my discretion to which I agreed. He then told me his wife had been seeing the ghost of a Civil War solider standing at the foot of their bed. He paid me a little bit generously and I went home. The memory of that kid’s shriek still sends a chill up my spine. 

Although I didn’t see anything, I think my experience validated what the mother been seeing (for her at least). I am not sure the husband believed her, or whether that night changed his opinion. At the very least, I got the vibe they disagreed about it.

I never babysat for them again, and as far as I know they haven’t moved. I’ve seen them at various gatherings and we are still friendly, but that night has never once been mentioned."
t3_e5kehq,all_ads,I might not be able to see my friends again,Thetruthishere,
t3_e50src,all_ads,I honestly believe my FF Uncle saved my FF Hubby.,Thetruthishere,"I am so glad I found this place. I have had so many weird paranormal things happening in my life it’s unreal. 

A little background for this one. I was raised by my Moms sisters, brothers, and 2 brothers in law. I come from a firefighter/EMT Medic Family. One particular aunt and uncle were on the FD together. My uncle was Fire Chief/EMT and my aunt was a nurse &amp; EMT. So it was really nothing to see me on scenes with them. 

My Uncle died in 1997, he had a heart attack after a structure fire. Some years later my hubby’s best friend talked him into joining the local FD with him. He did, he loved it. I joined also, starting out with the auxiliary, eventually going on to be operational. We were a team like my aunt and uncle. Our son, as well and best friends brothers joined also. One night they had a nasty structural fire call, I couldn’t go because I had a sick kid. So I stayed home and babysat the scanner. When the chief said to switch to Tac 1 Channel, I switched too. 

Hubby and best friend were first in the door with the hose. Our son and one of the brothers were on backup at the door. All of a sudden I hear hubby say “We gotta go! Get out now!! Go Go Go!!” Just as they hit the door the roof collapsed where they were standing. I do believe I held my breath until I heard the accountability call, hubby said their engine number x’s 4. They switched to a surround and drown tactic then. 

They came home and hubby was telling me what had happened. He kept hearing a voice in his head telling him to get out of the house. He said the voice was unfamiliar to him. I looked at him and said “Dude, my Uncle D just saved your lives.”  He looked at me and asked “Ya really think so?” His Buddy was a skeptic, at the time. I did make a believer out of him, eventually. He saw the crazy paranormal stuff that goes on at my house, and in my life. We lost him in 2012, so he’s now become part of that crazy paranormal stuff."
t3_e54t5b,all_ads,Old Childhood experience,Thetruthishere,"When I was ten I had this experience that affected my life for years afterward, and seems to have become relevant to my life again. I need advice or at least some theories on what could be happening. This was a long time ago, but I’ll try to remember it as best I can.

Around the age of ten, I started having minor vision problems. I’m not talking about being nearsighted or farsighted here. At random times my vision would blur and sometimes spin around. It was never bad enough that I couldn’t see at all, and usually I was sitting down so I was never in serious danger.
     There was a time though when I was going from my room to the kitchen when I saw something standing in the middle of my kitchen, and the random blurring started. It was by far the worst episode I’ve ever had. I couldn’t see anything at all, my vision almost looked staticky. It felt like my eyes were rolling in the back of my head. I had nothing to hold onto, so I ended up falling on my head. Beyond that point I don’t remember anything else about it. I ended up with a minor concussion from the fall and my parents chalked it all up to a focal seizure, and that was the end of it.
      I was never quite the same after that though. Before I was extroverted, but suddenly I wanted to avoid everyone. Usually I didn’t even feel like people mattered at all. I was always paranoid and anxious. There were crazy delusions going around my brain about people stalking me. I never had a single headache before that, and suddenly I started having a constant headache. My memory was basically nonexistent. I took up pacing as my only hobby. Sometimes there would be loud knocks or slams against the windows, for no reason. Most of these can pretty much be accounted for by my concussion.
      The majority of these symptoms disappeared suddenly after three long years. Some stay to this day, like my introverted behavior and my pacing habit. I still can’t remember too much from those three years either. The rest disappeared though once I started ignoring them. Even the knocking on the windows disappeared. I finally felt like I could be happy. Recently though, the knocks came back.
     My mom one day came into the same room as my dad and I in a panic. She claimed to have heard three clear knocks against the window. When my dad went to investigate though, there was nothing. Soon my mom wasn’t the only one to hear it around, and they became more frequent.
      I’m probably just being paranoid, but I can’t help but think there is some correlation between the two events."

t3_e4lbmb,all_ads,My guardian angel scared me in order to save me,Thetruthishere,"This happened the first week of January 1993, and it’s forever burned in my memory. 

My Mom worked 12 hour shifts over night at a cotton mill, so much of the time I was on my own. I was 18, having graduated that past May. I was kinda taking a gap year before I started college. I had slept most of the day, because I had come off of a particular scary trip to and from Texas. That’s another story for another time. She woke me long enough to ask my plans for the night. I told her I was going to (my now ex) boyfriends house. She told me to be careful and left. 

A few hours later I get ready to walk out the door. It’s very dark out, the porch light was out. I grab a flashlight, open the door, and there’s a car I don’t recognize parked in front of my house. A guy steps out and just shakes his head no. He stands there looking at me. I also noticed my dog Rusty was not barking and carrying on like normal when a stranger is near. I quickly go back in the house and lock the door. I am looking out the front window, and he’s just sitting in his car. About 20 minutes pass and I hear the car crank up. I am thinking once he leaves I will make a run for my car and go. Nope he pulls into the Morman church parking lot across from my house. Shines the headlights right at my house, flashes them a few times, and then turns them off. Great, I thought, I am trapped for now. 

Another 30 minutes go by, him sitting there, and me watching out the front window. Finally he cranks up and leaves in the opposite entrance of the parking lot, there were two ways into that lot. He disappears, I wait another 10 minutes before I actually leave. I go my usual route to the busy highway I have to cross. There was a wreck,so I detour to the gas station to grab a drink. I see one of my cop friends there, and we start talking. An 18 wheeler, with a drunk driver had ran the light about an hour ago and killed a woman. He said all the color had drained from my face, like I had saw a ghost. He asked what was wrong. So I relayed the story back to him of what I had been through in the last hour. He asked if it was the psycho that had been stalking me for the last year and a half. Nope this guy was too tall to be him. So he got out his note pad and got his description and his car description. He told me he would check it out, due to me being stalked. 

Before I left he stopped me and said “Ya know some times our guardian angel will do what they have to in order to save a life. You were supposed to be at that red light at that particular time, but you were saved for a reason.”  I cried all the way to my boyfriends house. I learned later she was a nurse and had just gotten off of her shift. She was a single mom, just like my mom. She was killed instantly. 

A few weeks later my cop friend told me he and others, who knew me, had done some checking in their free time to find the car and guy. He said none of the descriptions matched up, it was like it vanished into thin air. I carried survivors guilt for a long time. I got into the medical field and became an EMT."
t3_e4hu8h,all_ads,Some angels wear capes,Thetruthishere,"This happened 24 years ago...

My 5 month old son was due for his wellness visit that day. I was taking him and my 3 year old daughter to visit their Dad first, since we were newly separated. While there I was changing the baby’s diaper and he started projectile vomiting. 

There was still a few hours for his doctor appointment but I told my husband to get us there now because something was wrong. 

We get to the doctor and I’m signing in while my husband is trying to get the baby out of his snowsuit. But the baby was sleeping. That’s when the nurse realized he was turning blue. He had stopped breathing. 

This doctor had been my pediatrician when I was young so our relationship went way back. It happened that on this particular day she had an intern with her - she never had one. 

We couldn’t wait for the ambulance so the intern came with us doing CPR on our baby in the backseat while we raced to the ER. 

I remember seeing the medical staff working on his tiny body. They were trying to start an IV but his veins had collapsed. Nurses were walking away crying and that’s when I realized we could lose him.

Once they finally got him stable, he still hadn’t gained consciousness, they thought maybe he had meningitis and wanted to take a CAT scan. 

They sent my husband and little girl back to the doctor so she could get a physical in case she was sick too. So I was alone.

I remember riding in the elevator with two medical people. I can not remember if they were men/women or who they were.

We get off the elevator and it’s a short hallway with the only door leading to CAT scan room. There was also a small alcove with chairs to wait. You could see this from the elevator. I was crying. Shaking. In my head I was praying and bargaining with God to save my baby. 

I didn’t see or hear this woman come in. She just was sitting near me a seat away. I didn’t notice her when I sat down. I didn’t see her come from the elevator or the scan room. 

She had bright red hair. She had on a black fedora hat and a black cape. It would have been creepy but one side of the capes’ collar was turned down and it was a bright sunny yellow. In all my grief I remember thinking that bit of yellow made her seem friendly almost happy.

Then she told me, “don’t cry, he’s going to be ok.” I looked at her and she seemed around 50ish. She was slightly heavy but she was beautiful. 

Then they came out of the scan room and I got up to leave. At the elevator I turned to look back but the woman was gone. I asked one of the nurses where did that lady go? She asked, what lady?

Now I’m aware that in my hysterical state I could have imagined this woman but I am positive she was not made from my imagination. I believe she was an angel. 

My son would be in the ICU for a week. Turned out he had RSV and once diagnosed his recovery was fast."
t3_e4inuf,all_ads,What the hell is in the woods...,Thetruthishere,"Around 2008 - 2012,  in my early twenties, i would spend many weekends after a long week at work chilling out with my best friend and my older cousin doing the typical kind of things that bored young men do after a hard week at work - listening to music, jamming together on instruments as we all played in bands, going out drinking and smoking quite a lot of herb. We also would sometimes combine said activities with another hobby of ours; going on long walks and hanging out in the woodlands and countryside that surround our town, picking a spot and listening to music while sinking beers and smoking joints and talking about whatever. Always considered it a blessing that a 10 minute walk in any direction out of our town would take you out to scenic views of rolling hills and woodlands for miles upon miles as far as the eye could see. We had one particular spot in a woodland that is on the edge of town. Our chosen hangout was a stroll just off the woodland track about 5 minutes into the wood, where a bank rolled down to the edge of a stream - nice and secluded so we could smoke up and drink without attracting attention to ourselves and very peaceful, so you could hear someone coming from miles away if they were to walk the track nearby. We came here many, many times and had great hazy weekend evenings together at our little hangout, where we would often stay well into the night before heading back to the track and splitting off to our own homes once we reached the roads.One evening, this all changed - and we never went back anywhere near it getting dark again.

I remember clearly that this evening, we were enjoying eachother's company as usual, and while i had put a few beers away, i refrained from smoking this particular evening ( i think i was coming down with a cold and didn't fancy it), so i know that what happened was 100% real and not imagined or amplified in my mind from the effects of smoking.It had started to get dark, and i remember laughing as my cousin had brought a bong with him and i let he and my best friend get on with taking hits alternately until at one point, my cousin got a bit of a ""tickler"" as we jokingly called it, and was coughing and honking his lungs up from taking a rather large hit. I might add that our little area we were in was very dark by this point, and we would set a few candles up on the surrounding trees and rocks to light our spot up a little. We were positioned all sat on a log that was at the top of the bank of the stream with our backs to the vast expanse of woodland that continued on into the darkness behind us. My cousin is hacking his lungs up and my best friend and i are now laughing at him but a little concerned, until he reassured us he was alright and his coughing fit subsided. As soon as a break in our conversation occured, my cousin shot a look behind him into the woods suddenly and said ""SHHHHHH"" very quietly, while staring off behind us. I could see the concerned look on his face as he squinted, and watched as my best friend Ben followed his gaze and peered in the direction my cousin Aidan was looking... all three of us are now sat in complete silence,  turned staring into the blackness. I whispered to Aidan ""Mate, are you just pranging out a bit? I can't see or hear anyth---"" only to have my sentence cut off by a loud cracking sound in the direction we were all now facing.

I know most people by now who read this are thinking it's a woodland, so sure, there are animals who are making the noises - but we all knew this ourselves and were familiar with the wildlife in this area - something about this had a feeling to it, though, like we were being watched. It wasn't a nice feeling at all, and even the occasional sound of a bird in the trees surrounding us had stopped, leaving us in silence.

Aidan stood up slowly and said to us ""Put the candles out"", and i could see the humour from earlier in the evening had completely vanished from the look on his and Ben's faces. Ben and i got up slowly without question, and put the candles out, leaving us submerged in almost total darkness except for the moonlight reflecting off of the water in the stream and the occasional beam breaking through the gap in the overhanging trees above us. We gathered our belongings back into our backpacks and as we returned our view to the direction of the noise we had heard, Ben said he didn't like the feeling he was getting and that we should leave and maybe call it a night. Just as we climbed back up the bank, and turned left to head out back to the track, another cracking noise cut through the night. Then another, but this time it sounded like it had come toward us a good few metres, and i could tell by this point from the volume of the sound that whatever it was was quite heavy. We are now all walking single file, looking to our right into the pitch black of the woods where the sound had come from. One of us said ""What the fuck IS that...?!"" in a desperate but whispered tone and my cousin snapped a branch off of a nearby tree and threw it full pelt into the direction of the sound. Big fucking mistake. Something was clearly disturbed and came at us, heavily bashing the brush and low hanging branches in its path as it increased it's speed toward us. At this point we all near enough shit ourselves, and without saying a word began running as fast as possible for the exit back onto the track out of the woods which was around 100 metres or so away, tripping and stumbling due to our poor vision in the darkness. At one point, i remember i was running and whatever the fuck this thing was was running diagonally towards us just beyond my vision to my  rear right, and i could see and hear the trees and thicket being trampled by whatever it was...then, the most terrifying thing happened - this thing made this noise that sounded like it revved up from a screech to a loud, deep roar that was deafening, causing us all to scream in terror. I remember the noise made all of the hairs on my body stand on end and my vision tunneled into an absolute focus on the hole in the bushes that lead back to the track. My legs went into hyperspace and i covered the remaining distance and leapt out of the hole onto the track behind Aidan and Ben, who had already turned to face me as i almost piled into them. I turned to look from where we had just came, and we all stared, gasping for breath, back into the woods.

There was nothing. No sounds, and nothing emerged from the hole in the bushes. Dead silence.

After a minute, we continued back to the road, looking behind us every few feet paranoid out of our minds that whatever that thing was might reappear and come up behind us. We got to the road and stood under a streetlight. ""Fuck me, man, what WAS THAT!"" Ben said, eyes wide with a questioning look of utter horror. We all confirmed that we had no idea what the fuck this thing was, and that while none of us saw it directly, it was too big to be any of the animals we knew to live in those woods (Not a badger, a fox or even a stag) but it definitely was not a person because the sound it made was unlike anything a human could produce. We had heard foxes crying and stags and deer before many a time, especially during rutting season, this was definitely not any of those, no way. We had so many questions... why was it stalking us? Why did it charge at us, when most animals would see 3 men all over 6ft tall and decide it's odds weren't really in it's favour if it chose to attack for some reason? None of it made sense, but we all knew that it 100% happened and terrified us enough to feel our lives were truly threatened.

We told our parents when we got home and while many of them grew up in the same area and played in those woods as kids during the 60's and 70's, they all said the only odd thing they had ever heard of happening in there was as kids they were warned not to stay in the woods after dark as the ""Petticoat man"" would get them. This turned out to be a slightly fruity individual that would dress in women's clothing and flash those that came through the woods, before running off. He was eventually either arrested or someone's dad kicked his head in, depending on who you asked.

Ben never came back to the woods with Aidan and I again, insisting we could just hangout somewhere more open and well lit, and rightly so. Aidan and i returned to the woods one last time during the following week, around 3pm, and it being summer the woods were well lit by the baking sun. We spent half hour or so playing detective, but couldn't work out what the thing had been... we found a few crushed plants where it had run towards the track, but it wasn't conclusive enough to determine this thing had been the cause. The reason Aidan and i stopped going back at all was that during sharing a joint, Aidan looked at me and smiled and said ""Don't be obvious about it, but look behind me at the edge of the wood..."" and there, stood half hidden behind a tree clearly watching us, was a man. It creeped me out a bit until i worked out that we were not small lads and this guy wouldn't stand a chance taking both of us on, especially now we'd seen him. He just stood there, and i made deliberate eye contact with him and he didnt move. Aidan turned to face him and said ""What are you doing over there, mate?!"" and i followed it by shouting ""OI, you fucking weirdo, we CAN see you!"" at which point he stood out from the tree, froze for a second and then ran out of the woods. I don't think the two incidents were related in any way, but we never went back there after that.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if it sounded like some pro-drugs/drinking story - i'd never condone either to anyone else, this was just a time of our lives as young men that we indulged in those kinds of things. I'd also like to state that while i was drinking on the night of the bizarre and horrifying thing chasing us, i was definitely not drunk and was fully conscious of what was happening. We're all older now and i no longer see Ben or Aidan, people have kids and fallings out and life has occured. I do wonder if it still bothers them if they even remember it... the man attempting to hide and watch us was creepy, but the thing in the woods that came at us making that fucking awful sound still gives me goosebumps to this day."

t3_e47y3q,all_ads,Delivered in my childhood...,Thetruthishere,"Another post on this reddit triggered up some memories from early childhood.  When I was four, way back in the 1950s, I went down to the bank restroom in the basement.  I was doing my business on the porcelain throne when an adult foot nudged my foot under the stall wall.  Irritated, I kicked back at the foot.  The next thing I knew an adult was cajoling me to open the stall door and let him.

I got very frightened, and didn't know what to do.   The stall was up against the wall.  The first one in line.  The creepy man forced to the door open, which I was putting my shoulder against, and when it gave way, I was knocked flat on my back on the floor.  Looking up fro the floor I saw a very serene and dignified old man, with gray white hair step up out of the wall.  With a very sinister smile he said to my attacker, ""his father is going to be down here in about thirty seconds.   Believe me when I tell you this, you don't want to be here when he arrives"".

Whether of shame at getting caught in such and act, or stunned by a man stepping out of the wall, my attacker raced away.  I heard his steps pounding up the stairs.  Seconds after that my father arrived and was looming in the stall door looking down on me.  He scooped me up, and ran his hands all over me to make sure nothing was broken, and then raced after my assailant.  By the time he got up the stairs the man had made it out the bank and down the city streets.

My father was a combat Marine from World War Two, and had also been boxing champion of the 7th fleet.  He latter said a voice shouted in his mind to run to the restroom right then.  The attacker ran right by him.  I'm obviously glad for the angel that stopped the assault upon me.  I am equally glad that he chased off the guy before my Dad could get there, because my Dad would surely have beaten him to death.  No doubt about it.  The angel saved us both.  Me from the attacker, and my father from going to jail."
t3_e44t76,all_ads,Angels in the Diner,Thetruthishere,"Backstory: 
Me and my bestfriend/roommate are in the Army. We had gotten off work pretty late and decided to do a late night waffle house run. (11:30-midnight).

He's very religious, not in the sense that he goes to church but in the sense that he's a real believer. He's had a lot of haunted/weird coincidental events in his life. He is like a magnet for weird spiritual events like this.

I'm an atheist, atleast or so I had thought. I guess I'm agnostic now. I did not believe, I had no experiences of my own and unless I'm in proximity of him, I dont experience anything. 

Set up: 
On the drive over, My buddy is having a crisis of faith and is telling me how he doesn't seem to have faith the way he used to and he's not sure if it's all real. I tell him that maybe he's just in a funk and the Army is getting to him, we dismiss the convo and get some breakfast! 

It's only us, the waffle house crew and an old couple in the diner. 
We sit down and order, and that's when things got weird. 

We are not approachable looking. People do not talk to us, apparently I always look angry and my buddy is muscular and scary. Nobody ever goes out of their way to talk to me or my friends. 

But for some weird reason this couple was doing their damndest to initiate conversation with us. So finally we submit and start bullshitting with them. 

We start asking them questions in a casual manner but mainly because we dont trust them. I get up to the jukebox and put on Rolling Stones, ""Sympathy for the Devil"" (important). Mainly for the music but also so I could get a better look at them.

Info I see: guy is about 50 at the oldest. She is about the same.

Info we got: 
He was a young Lt. in vietnam.

I asked him if he liked the Stones and he goes, ""Yeah, they're my favorite band"" and then we talk about his time in 'Nam, but also mainly to see what does and doesnt check out because dudes like to fake that they were in the military.

And then he asks me, who sings the song that's currently on. And what is the songs name. 

2 red flags show up pretty soon: 
1. I'm not buying the young Lt. In vietnam story because nothing he said made sense and his age didn't check out. The army jargon didnt check out, I guess is what I'm saying. So I instantly think he is lying to us in order to connect with us on, ""Hey, I was in the Army too!"" 

2. Second red flag. IF this guy was in Vietnam. IF this guy's favorite band is the Rolling Stones. He should definitely know and recognize ""Sympathy for the Devil"" it is quintessential Vietnam-era music and a Rolling Stones classic.

So instantly my buddy and I peg this couple as bullshit and begin assuming that they have an angle. 

1. Why would an older couple be out at midnight in fayetville, NC ( not a good area) at waffle house. 

2. Why are they trying to initiate conversation with us? 
3. Why are they lying? 

My buddy and I get up to leave and they ask us to stay, we keep moving and as we leave, the old guy grabs my arm and says,
"" I used to think God was a joke too"" 

I sorta chuckled because I thought he was Joking, but then I realize he's not looking at me, he's looking at my friend.

""Until I realized the truth."" 

Then he let's me go, and we get outta there.

It was only on the way home that my roommate put all of the points together and he was like,
""Bro! I think those guys were Angels! You remember how I was telling you I was having a crisis of faith?! What are the chances we meet those two weirdos doing their best impression of humans and desperately trying to engage us in conversation. And then that shit he said to me before we left!? Those were fucking Angels bro!"" 

And honestly man, I believe him. So that's the story.

Sorry for the length."

t3_e3pwi8,all_ads,First experience with anything paranormal in my new house,Thetruthishere,"Warning in advance, I'm a long-winded person so this will be a long read.

I bought a house in March, but didn't move into it until the end of May. The house has three bedrooms upstairs and I always kept all the bedroom doors open, which is a habit of mine even though I know it's not that fire safe. Four months after moving in though I started to feel weird about the extra bedroom and I started shutting the door. I couldn't sleep with the door open, and I very rarely went in it because I didn't feel very safe in it. Like where you get the whole flight or fight reflex and don't want to turn your back to it. So I closed the door and stopped going in there. Didn't really notice the change, but now looking back, I think that's where it started.

Around then, my dog started to get really upset at night. My dog (a 1 year old lab) would bark down the hallway or at the reading nook area. His hackles would be raised, and even weirder, he would back up and move, seemingly reacting to something. Once he even seemed to freak out at something and mid barking-fit he turned around and sprinted back to my bedroom before jumping on my bed and staring down the hallway like he was running from something.  That was when I started to get a little nervous, since it didn't seem like he was barking at the neighbors or something in the street. He seemed to be reacting to something in the house. Here's some videos:

[https://streamable.com/60zai](https://streamable.com/60zai)

[https://streamable.com/d28pl](https://streamable.com/d28pl)

In one video you can see him barking down the stairs (and yes, I definitely started sleeping with the light on) and in the other you can see him barking at the reading nook. There is nothing in that corner but a small armchair and a bookcase, which you can partially see in the video.

Again, It was starting to freak me out but nothing major, until October.

I was in bed, trying to doze off. My dog had been especially loud this night and was getting up every 5 minutes to growl down the hallway. He was finally asleep though at the foot of my bed, and I was almost asleep too, when I heard a series of very fast and VERY loud knocks that lasted about 10 seconds. I was pretty disoriented and my heart was beating and my first instinct was to hope that no one was breaking in. Strangely enough though my dog bolted awake and sprinted to the reading nook corner and started up his growling. Previously, if he heard a noise from outside like neighbors pulling in with their loud car, he would run downstairs to bark at the window. Personally, I could not isolate where the sound was coming from and if it was downstairs or upstairs, so I can't say for certain if it was coming from the corner where he was barking. I finally settled him back down and managed to doze off again.

This time, I woke up suddenly to the knowledge that someone was walking towards me. I KNEW someone was taking steps closer to my bedroom from the hallway and I bolted up and called my mom, convinced someone had broken in and was about to come up on me. When I looked around though, I couldn't see anyone. I wanted her advice on if I should call the police still, even though I hadn't seem anyone. I mean, I had no doubt that someone was there, but there was no one. She didn't answer, but I told my mom about it later and she suggested that my house could be haunted. I decided to set up a sleep recorder for the rest of the week until the weekend. And I got this audio:

first night: [https://soundcloud.com/unhappy\_dedication/2349f852](https://soundcloud.com/unhappy_dedication/2349f852)

second night: [https://soundcloud.com/unhappy\_dedication/234b1ee7](https://soundcloud.com/unhappy_dedication/234b1ee7)

For reference, my phone was on my nightstand next to my head. I could hear several things in a bunch of videos, including my dog moving, me moving, AC turning on, etc and all were much more quiet than these noises, though you can tell that the bang in the first video woke me up a bit.

In the second video you can hear what sounds like something dragging then what sounds like three footsteps after. I tried to mimic the sounds and I can't quite match the second one, but the first one sounds like my bookcase door or a cabinet door slamming shut. It also sounds like it's further away from my bed and down the hallway, whereas you can kinda sense the proximity of me rustling awake after hearing the noise. Though, I'm not good at analyzing audio so I could be off base about that. If anyone has any suggestions on what those noises are, please let me know!

Long story short, we did the candle test and the wicks of two candles simulatiously went out in the guest bedroom. No AC, no windows open, no moving air. And three times (we tested in other rooms too) the two candles went out at the same time in the extra bedroom. No flickering and no embers on the wick after either. Just strong, steady flame then it was like someone grabbed the wick with wet fingers.

That was enough for my mom so she saged the entire house. Since then...nothing. My dog hasn't barked in the corner or the staircase. I keep the bedroom door open now and haven't felt weird at all. Haven't felt a flight or fight instinct either when walking up or down the stairs too, which is a huge added bonus since before the saging there were a few times where I would feel an intense sense of panic and would run up the stairs.

And that's my first experience with anything paranormal. Honestly, I'm still doubtful sometimes just because that's the type of person I am. But the fact that my dog hasn't barked since we saged is too much of a coincidence for me."
t3_e46563,all_ads,"I relayed a story I had about a weird encounter and atleast some people enjoyed it. So now I have a question, this is for anyone that has experienced a longer term haunting or experience.",Thetruthishere,"If you think back to your experience or even if you are currently in an ongoing experience, did you notice a sort of ""grooming"" process? 

Sort of like human predators will do to people in abusive or exploitative relationships in that, the experiences start small and then gradually become more intense but to you, it becomes normalized.

For example: in the time that me and my roommate lived together the grooming process went as follows and lasted about 6 months.

Creepy ripped up poster in our drawer 
Knife in the microwave. 
Shaking doors. 
Glasses would fly off counters. 

My diner experience (I made a post) 
To a voice in my closet.

Finally ending with each of us having an experience of seeing each other in the room when we were not there. 
He had a full conversation with me when I wasnt even home. 

And I personally looked at him in his room, only to have him ask me, ""who the hell I was talking to""...from inside my room.

Just curious about other people's experiences."
t3_e3t88c,all_ads,Disturbing dream,Thetruthishere,"This is extremely personal and I never talked about the dream not even to close friends/family. So a few years back around my sophomore year of high school I had this crazy vivid dream. It was like I was spectating my mom crying in a room and she was with my dad. I didn’t understand why she was crying at first but they looked much younger like the photos of from the beginning of their marriage. She talking with someone, I didn’t know who on the phone as she cried and mentioned something about having “a second misscaraige”. I woke up thought that it was simply just another weird dream. Then things got weird..... a couple days later we find out my uncle and his wife just had a misscairage. I thought nothing of it relating to my dream until I hear my mom talking to him on the phone trying to comfort him. She mentions that she had two misscairages to him. I was honestly shocked and didn’t know what to say. I avoided the subject completely because it would be a touchy subject. I never knew any of this info before my dream and just think it’s too extreme to be a coincidence. Any similar experiences?"
t3_e3jiaz,all_ads,'Hellier' Season Two is on Amazon Prime Video! Definitely check this out if you haven't yet. It's probably my favorite paranormal program of all time.,Thetruthishere,"I was pretty stoned when I first watched this series last year, but it totally blew me away at the time. The show deals with some of the more strange paranormal phenomenon like goblins, synchronicities, and underground cave systems in the U.S. - much of it leads down such strange and unexpected paths. Hellier is quite fresh and unpredictable. This is the type of Paranormal show I've wanted my whole life. Much of it is so uncanny, and the researchers aren't completely insufferable, which is nice.

Anyone else seen it? I did a search and didn't find much on here.

Edit: if you've had your doubts about this show, (rightfully) it gets super fucking cool after episode 5. At least start half-way at episode 5 and watch from there because this is getting really good."
t3_e42aaz,all_ads,"Houses ( I believe it's worth the read, lmk what you think)",Thetruthishere,"You know what's weird? You can have a house that you build from ground up and live in it your whole life then pass it on from generation to generation and that's that. Or you can have the ground up house and move out and another family moves in and creates memories in that house you were just creating memories in. Or you can be one of many in the exact same house once in your life and move on. 
And on side note to that, just popped in my head lmao is that if you have a house that have a lot of people coming and going example a house from 1700s and it's been passed on and now the year is 1905, a ton of people and different energies have gone through the house that is why they consider houses to be ""haunted"" because a lot of people leave bad energy?

t3_e3pf2y,all_ads,Is it possible for dreams to come true?,Thetruthishere,"Last weekend, I went to this place where you could play sports and exercise. I was with my friends, and we were playing ping pong for a school project. Suddenly, I had this weird thought. I thought I dreamt of this experience before.

Before you start spamming in the comments: No, it wasn't Deja Vu because I KNEW that I dreamt about this. I could distinctively remember that I dreamt about this because I thought that the dream I had was weird because I playing ping pong (im not an athlete and im not sporty in any way so it definitely could not have happened)

I want to know if anyone ever tried having a dream of theirs come true and what they think of it. I just thought it would be cool to say this,  but I once saw this post that claimed that dreams that you remember will most likely come true. 

Just a little bit context:
-I cant remember when exactly I had the dream but I do remember it was pretty long ago. Not that long ago though, probably just a few months ago.
-The thought felt like Deja Vu. However, I actually knew that I dreamt about this. 
-The instances in the dream were completely the same as in the real life experience. In the dream, I was right beside the table, and I was beside the table in real life too. The people (my friends)  who were in the dream were coincidentally, there too.

t3_e3geld,all_ads,I just realized 3 years ago I could have been abducted....,Thetruthishere,"100% true story,
3 years ago I moved to Austin Texas from California (sheesh typical) it was my first time living on my own ever My first Place in an apartment complex on the second floor I had lived there for about 7 maybe 8 months or so and one night I was in bed I had been laying down for about 30 min or so and I have always had some kind of trouble sleeping you would say, usually it takes me an hour to fall asleep so maybe I was right there about to fall asleep idk 
But then I started to hear this humming ... the humming I first thought was in my ear then I started hearing it almost bounce off the walls like it was coming from somewhere specific then I started feeling this feeling of almost being electrocuted it wasn’t painful but for any of you that have been shocked before by 24v or something there’s this tightening feeling anyway my body became unable to move by unable to move I mean I was paralyzed from this feeling of what seemed to be electricity I was like this for what felt like ever, I think about 20-30 seconds as soon as I was able to move the humm continued but slowly faded away let me tell you the lights couldn’t of come on in my apartment any faster, I ripped those blinds open and saw nothing, I was even so certain I got electrocuted I went to my phone charger and my phone and checked if there were any cuts in the wire or something 
It was about 11:00 11:30 I ended up freaking out called my parents and explained what happened to me, of course my mother freaking out being so far away starts to google what had happened to me 
I haven’t looked for this in awhile but she found someone else 1 other person with the same exact story I had and when I mean same story I mean the humming then the feeling of being electrocuted, then paralysis, in bed!!!
I never went to the doctor and I became really paranoid at night for a while but then eventually got over it till this day it has not happened again 
I have always believed in aliens and never really thought of it till now

I want to put some notes here

I didn’t recognize a loss of time or time lapse I could of but if I did I don’t think I recognized it ,
Also I wasn’t under the influence of drugs or alcohol or weed"

t3_e30rr3,all_ads,[ShP] Strangeness in our apartment,Thetruthishere,"Today I came across some pictures again that made me remember some events that took place in our old apartment we have since moved out of about 1.5 years ago.

For a few months at least my wife and I were pretty irritated by what took place and some of it could just be discounted or easily explained, but other parts still give me goosebumps.

In the beginning, it happend several times that I heard a loud crashing sound in the middle of the night when I was working and my wife was sleeping. I checked the dark apartment and found  that the toothbrushes and razors had fallen into the bathtub. They were attached to the mirror with something like [this](http://www.gustorfer-freunde.de/image/cache/data/category_23/Bad%20Starken%20Saugnapf%20Zahnpasta%20Zahnbuumlrstenhalter%20Wand%20Zahnbuumlrste%20Haumlngende%20Lagerung%20Regal%20ali88514660-500x500-product_popup.jpg) so it would not be too hard to explain it.

But one night, I heard a really loud noise again and found the bathroom looking like [this](https://imgur.com/opMYpSQ) and immediately took that picture.

Previously, the hair dryer was attached to the wall with a hook where the cable is still plugged in. [Now both were on the opposite side of the room.](https://imgur.com/W0WzAwW) If the hook had become loose, the hair dryer would have just fallen down right next to the toilet, but it somehow managed to get over the open toilet while leaving the tip of the hair dryer right next to it. No matter how long I look at that picture, I cannot explain how everything ended up where it did.

On another day, we wanted to cook some dinner, so I opened the kitchen cabinet to get a pot only to find [this](https://imgur.com/52wWl8M) oven cloth between the pots.

At this point we had already lived there for about a year and used that cabinet frequently, but we had never seen that cloth before and have no idea where it came from. It was just there. We tried to come up with any explanations. Sometimes my mother in law brought us some food, but when we asked her, she said it wasnt hers. My wife was freaked out and threw it away soon.

One time we came back home and as soon as we entered, I hear a gasp from my wife. We were already a little on edge due to the events and she was looking at some flowers in our living room. 

One was in [this](https://imgur.com/a/289e678) condition. It had snapped clean off, but was still attached like this. [Here](https://imgur.com/JbAneF4) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/BHdBcLb) are some more views. I have never seen a flower do this. We put the head in some water and after a while, the stem split in four.

There were a few smaller things that happend every now and then like screws coming loose of different things in the same area. Almost hit my had with a cabinet door.

A box of fried chicked was suddenly on the floor and it just doesnt make any sense. It was on the table just moments before. One window was open many times without us opening it.

One time I took the elevator up to our 10th floor and ended up in front of the apartment on the 15th floor. I quickly went into the elevator again to see that the 10th floor button was still lit. Maybe I pushed the button for the 15th floor, but it would have passed the 10th before that. And so on and so on ...

For some things I can find the easiest explanations, but what happend to that flower, where did that cloth come from and how did the hair dryer end up on the opposite side of the room ...

Nothing ever happend since we moved."
t3_e2siw6,all_ads,"A beam of light came down from the ""Moon.""",Thetruthishere,"About 11:00pm, I returned to the balcony of my brother's mountain subdivision home to retrieve the tobacco I left out there. As soon as I grabbed the tobacco, the ""moon"" shined a spotlight down into the woods. The light was unusual in the sense that it stopped suddenly at the edges: it went from being lit as brightly as daylight to dark as night. The circumference of light at ground level was approximately 25-30 feet.

I stood at the edge of the balcony and watched as it swept back and forth like a spotlight searching for something. It took about 7-12 seconds for it to reach the edge of the woods (where the woods met the backyard). At this point, it quit sweeping back and forth and continued in a straight path through the yard, to the house, and up the wall toward my niece's window. When the edge of the light was about an inch below the window, the light changed direction toward me.

When I was in the middle of the light, it stopped moving for the first and only time. I was so excited, thinking I was about to be abducted and get to see what it was like inside an alien spacecraft. I stared up at the source of the light, and even though the light was brighter than any light I've ever seen, it did not hurt my eyes to look into it. After about 4 seconds, the beam of light disappeared and I could again see the ""moon."" It looked exactly like the moon--size, luminescence, markings, identical in every way.

After about 2 seconds, it started waning. It took about 3 seconds for the moon to wane completely out of sight. (The best way to describe it is imagine you were inside a sewer looking up at an open manhole then someone slid the cover over the hole.) There was nothing in the sky where the ""moon"" was moments before. I stared up for a good while, trying to catch a glimpse of something but never saw anything. There was no wind or sound at all, so I think it's safe to say it was not a helicopter or any man-made craft...at least not with any technology I know about.

My brother and his wife were in the room just inside during this but were watching TV so their backs were turned to the light. I ran inside to tell them about it. It freaked my brother out so bad that he wouldn't leave the bed the following day. I went back over to try and comfort him. We returned to the balcony where it happened and saw an odd looking man walking through the woods where the light was shining. His face was bulbous and he wore old, dirty, very thick clothing even though it was warm. He carried a bucket and what looked like one of those grabber tools people use to pick up trash.

He was walking through my brother's property so we yelled out to him to find out who he was and why he was trespassing. We got no response. He just kept walking, sweeping that grabber tool from side to side like someone would move a metal detector. My brother yelled, ""I have a gun and I demand to know who you are and why you are on my property."" Still no response.

My brother grabbed his gun and we walked out the backdoor to the edge of the woods. My brother yelled, ""This is your last opportunity. Tell me who you are and why you're here or I will open fire."" The man didn't respond whatsoever. He just continued slowly walking through the woods. I wanted to follow him but my brother had an eerie feeling about it so we didn't. The man continued on out of sight. I don't know if it was related, but it was a big coincidence that he was looking for something in the exact spot the ""moon"" was looking the night before."

t3_e2fild,all_ads,My mom and I separately experienced the same strange thing,Thetruthishere,"This happened a couple of years ago when I was in uni and came to live with my parents for the whole summer. One day my mom asked me to go outside and hang the laundry out to dry. We had a garden and there was a path in the middle of it. Right above that path there's strings to hang the laundry on.

So I went outside and it was the middle of the day, sun shining brightly and all. As I took a step onto this path I immediately felt that something was wrong. I felt scared. But since there was no rational reason for the fear I tried to ignore it. My whole body tensed up but I made myself go further.

I stopped in the middle of the path and felt almost paralized with fear at this point. I started to hang the clothes out trying to move as fast as possible but it felt like everything was in slow motion. It literally felt like I was held at a gunpoint.

At this point I got a very clear thought, it said ""run"". And it kept repeating in my head over and over. I could hear it so clear in my mind it almost felt like someone was whispering it into my ear. But my rational part was saying things like ""dont be ridiculous, this is your property, it's the middle of the day and no one can be here. Maybe you should fix your sleep schedule"" etc. But I was so scared I couldn't even make myself look around to check if someone was there.

I finished with the laundry and ran for my life. As soon as I stepped under the roofed part of the yard the fear dissapeared right away. I went back inside and didn't mention it to my mother because I thought she'd laugh at me.

However 15 minutes later my mom went ouside too. She returned and said to me ""I just went outside and when I was in the middle of the garden I felt so scared all I could think about was that I had to run"". I said I'd felt the exact same way and for some reason we both agreed that it was something more paranormal rather than a real danger. When my dad came home and heard about it he said there could have been someone there with some bad intentions and we just felt it. He went to check but didn't find anything or anyone. I'm still not sure what to think of this."
t3_e2v4or,all_ads,Me and moms dreams about a house we lived in,Thetruthishere,"Real life: So in this house. I saw people from the civil war era I had dreams of the war and the carnage as well as onetime I saw an entity who looked like my mom. We moved out when I was 5 or 6 and My mom me and my grandma lived there.

Dream #1 : So about this 8 months ago I had a dream that me and 2 friends went to a house I used to live in to see of we could find some stuff that was left behind in the move. Keep in mind this house was built pre-civil war and used as a makeshift hospital during the battle that occurred there. When we moved out the bank took ownership of the house from my uncle who we were renting it from as he took the back off trying the fix the foundation. So anyway we go to the back and the house looks how I last saw it with the back torn off and the patio gone we go to where it was tore off and instantly the house was back to how it was when I was a kid. When we go in we start having paranormal experiences and demons are everywhere something that looked like my mom tormented us and the house kept going between how it was when I was a kid, to  dilapidated with the back off and then back to pristine condition like what it may have looked like the day it was built. I take a small box of my grandmas and leave and when I get home the stuff from the house had followed me home. I find out a demon binded to my grandmas box and then I wake up

Dream #2:  I have what I can only assume is a time slip and am in said house during a house party in the late 1800's its a semi formal dinner party

Dream #3 It starts in first person and I go through a cattle gate from the woods onto a dirt road I walk up to a house its. A small 2 story country style home that has an identical color scheme to the real life house I used to live in from dream 1, it looks like a different version of the same house. It is around 5 or 6 pm in the country in a rural place and its in the spring or summer as all the trees are full of leaves and there is thick vegetation. I go into 3rd person view and see myself opening the door and knowing I'm in the middle of restoring the house and the house is mine. I never see inside the house and this dream has happened twice within a week the second time happening directly after dream 2 like dream 2 cut and then immediately this dream started again. It is the exact same dream both times.


So today my mom had a dream about the house similar to mine. What would this even be an example of? Is it a haunting or what?

t3_e2sav2,all_ads,Mysterious Flying 'Book',Thetruthishere,"This happened in 2015 shortly before I relocated (which plays a part towards the end).

I was renting an old (1920s) house while taking some specialized college courses. I'd been in the house nearly 2 years at this point so I was very familiar with it's quirks and oddities.

At this time, I was engaged in a video game on my computer in a spare room which served as storage and entertainment area. The lights were almost all off in the house, with the exception of the bathroom where my fiancée was walking out of towards my location (the spare room was only slightly offset from the bathroom door). As she got through the doorway I turned around and we spoke for a couple of seconds when it happened suddenly, like a scared bird.

From the darkness between myself and my fiancée's location (there were some scattered boxes around) what appeared to be light gray, about 8 inches long and 5 or so inches wide came flying towards my fiancée, curved to the right to avoid her face then flew straight into the living room and disappeared in the darkness. It didn't make any sound either of us heard, and we didn't hear anything indicating it'd landed either. It looked like a book, not very thick and flapping it's 'wings' with the spine of the book facing upward.

We did a full search of the living room, then the rest of the house. We didn't have many belongings at all so there weren't many places an animal could hide. A few weeks later we were relocating and during packing/cleanup we found no trace of any animal.

My fiancée had gotten the best look as it came right at her face, and she agreed it looked like a book flying on it's own and had no discernable head or facial features. This really messed with her as she said at prior times she'd seen tiny white dots of light drifting around the house late at night when I'd be at my part-time job. I never saw those, but my fiancée swears she did and began staying out later to avoid running into them when I wasn't around.

Never figured out what any of this was, but haven't had such incidents again since moving."

I remember it being very colorful, like I was looking through layers of colors. That’s the best way I can describe it. Then I started falling very fast towards my body. I even felt myself slam back into my body, and then I “woke up.”

t3_e2bkbp,all_ads,Bigfoot in BC,Thetruthishere,"This happened in September. I (22f) live in a tiny alpine town in British Columbia, near the Rocky Mountains. A close friend of mine was getting married in another small town, about 3 hours away. She had chosen me to be a bridesmaid, and asked that I be there a day before the wedding, since they had rehearsals and set-up to do. I was told to be at her hotel at 8am. 
To save myself the extra hotel costs, I decided to leave early in the morning and not the night before. 
My best friend (23m), who had travelled from Vancouver for the wedding, decided to carpool with me, despite it being super early in the morning and a day before the wedding. He figured he'd do some sightseeing while the rest of us rehearsed.
So that morning, we started our road trip with coffee, snacks, and our favourite music blasting from the speakers of my crappy car. We are cruising along for a good 2 hours when I remember that, to get to this town, there is one weird turnoff you have to take. It is a pretty heavily wooded area so it can be a bit confusing to find certain roads, as most signage is covered by brush. After a while I see (what I think is) the right turn off, and start driving down that road.
So we are having an absolute BLAST. It had been a while since we'd seen each other in person and it was great to talk again and sing along to the old songs we loved so much. To say the least, we got a bit carried away because when I checked the clock, I realized we had been driving for almost 2 HOURS. 
We look at each other-and then at our surroundings-and realize we are in the middle of god damn NOWHERE and DEFINITELY NOT on the right path. I start to slow the car down when my friend freezes and says, ""What the hell is that??"". And I'm squinting through the morning mist and see a large man, dressed in all brown, walking from the edge of the trees to the road. He was pretty far away from us, but he seriously looked VERY large from where we were. I hit my brakes and watch this ""man"" cross the road with long, slow strides to the forest on the other side. We sit there in shock, since there is little to no civilization in these parts. We are both pretty freaked so I turn the car around and we rip outta there.
We haven't told many people, but we both agree we saw a Sasquatch that day!"

Ever since I can remember, I have had the ability to see the world in different ways.... For some background I am 18 currently and this has subsided somewhat but I still can switch how I see everything in 2 seconds if I really wanted to. So starting from the beginning.... As a child I remember viewing things differently, I don’t even know how to put it in words. It’s not in the sense where I can switch from one view and everything is physically unrecognizable but it makes everything look completely different. Everything is in the same spot and is exactly how it was in the past viewpoint but it all just looks so different. Anyways, each season I would have a different way of viewing everything.... summer, fall, winter, and spring. It is now limited to summer and winter views only.... for example everything would be the same as I switched from summer to fall in the sense that everything from the other viewpoint was exactly where it was before. There was just an overwhelming vibe that went with each one. All my memories are formed in the viewpoint I had when an event happened. Anyways there was a crazy vibe that went with each one. I would switch from one to another and get a completely different feel for the world and it all looked different. This happened everywhere I went, grandparents house, my house, school, backyard, etc.... I do not know how to describe it and am trying my very best to put it in words but it is almost just .....unexplainable. Anyone have anything even remotely similar happen to them or an explanation as to what the hell is happening?"

I meditated at this lake often, but this time was very different, I started to feel really light and happy, I couldn't stop smiling then I saw around 20 spheres of white light about the size of baseballs fly down from the sky and into my body, its hard to explain how they felt when entering my body but I felt amazing and full of happiness. Afterwards I walked back home and called the girl who broke up with me only an hour ago and explained my perspective of the universe and why I didn't believe in religion and we got back together, and dated for four years.

t3_e28q4o,all_ads,Strange Knocking Since House Blessing to Remove Siblings' Childhood Haunting,Thetruthishere,"Nine months ago I posted about my significantly younger half-brother Tyler having issues  - refusing to sleep in the living room, only with the lights on, or staying up all night - because of a thin girl with spidery hands at the end of his bed at night. It was the exact same description of something I'd briefly mentioned in a post about my sister Ashley three years ago, that came from a conversation I'd had with her a year before that, during a period of time our house had some unusual activity going on while she lived with us (first incident was three days after she moved in, last was three days after she moved out - until Tyler moved into Ashley's old room).

Basically they both had the same bedroom as children, saw the same ghost, something like 20 years apart.

I knew I had to do something to get him sleeping in his room again so I brought in a friend from the Orthodox church, they got a priest to come, and we got a blessing. So far it's been a few months now and there hasn't been any sights or sounds from the ghost. Tyler's still sleeping in his room, and not on the sofa anymore. I thought everything was good.

Except that yesterday, my mother confessed to hearing knocks - three clear loud knocks - on the front door and on her second story bedroom window a few times over the past few weeks, and a feeling of dread like she shouldn't answer/let whatever it is in. She also mentioned seeing at times both the dog and the cat respond to the knocking - turning to look at it, inching away from it, fur standing up and running away from where it came from.

I feel like it's a good thing whatever it is isn't IN the house.  I would like things to stay way. Whatever it is is scaring my mother and she's afraid it's only a matter of time until it DOES get in.

I should also mention that about the time this specific activity started - the knocking - our neighbors started clear-cutting a part of their land near ours, and have started building a workshop on it for the husband's woodworking projects. It's going to be a two-story shop with a small apartment at the top to rent, and the construction has been very disruptive, to say the least.

Any advice?  Things we can do to keep our house safe? Comforting things that might help my mom not feel scared at night?"
t3_e1wny6,all_ads,"""My Parents"" at the foot of my bed",Thetruthishere,"When I was super little, maybe three or four, I remember laying in bed at night and seeing my parents standing at the foot of my bed.  I remember feeling like they weren't actually my parents but trying to trick me.  I also remember feeling like I'd seen these imposters before.  They said a bunch of awful things to me, about me.  I specifically remember them saying they had a knife in the kitchen and they were going to hurt me with it.  

Sounds terrifying, but strangely, I wasn't afraid.  I felt like I was enveloped by some sort of strong, protective, good energy that allowed me to see the truth about these beings and that it wasn't going to let them hurt me or fool me.  This energy felt much stronger than them and I remember it being very comforting.  It was like these beings were trying their damndest to scare me by impersonating my parents but failing miserably.  I remember thinking their vernacular was overly simplified and stilted, like, ""You are bad."" or ""We don't like you.""  They seemed like they were assuming, ""This is how you talk to kids, because kids' vocabulary is limited."" but it sounded so unnatural and I saw right through it.  I was also too young too understand that anything about this experience was out of the ordinary or paranormal, which is another reason it didn't frighten me.  

I remember seeing them at the foot of my bed again when I was a bit older, maybe 6 or 7.  This time, I was old enough to know it wasn't normal and it creeped me out.  Right after they disappeared, I felt a wave of dread wash over me and bolted out of my bed and ran to the living room to my actual mom who was sitting on the couch and told her what had happened.  She assumed it was a bad dream, but I don't remember these instances as dreams.  I felt awake the whole time."
t3_e1lxc0,all_ads,Writing on the wall,Thetruthishere,"I've posted this on a couple of paranormal reddits looking for possible answers. 
Several times I have seen ""writing"" in mid air. It happens at night, in the dark. The writing looks like it's made of light. Like neon but doesn't have the smooth edges of the neon tubes.  The edges look sort of smoky. It's bright, it looks lit but doesn't seem to actually give off any light. It doesnt brighten the area around it.  It's usually 3 or 4 lines long. I either can't read it or don't remember what it says.  I can't say that it is in my language (English) or not. It seems important and I can't look away from it.  It doesn't cause me any type of fear. The last time it happened, I asked it to stop. This was a couple of years ago I guess.  Now my 14 year old daughter explained to me a few days ago that she was seeing writing in light. It sounded just like what I had seen. I had never mentioned it to anyone because it just seemed so bizarre and I didn't think anyone would believe me.  It doesn't scare her either so I'm not worried about it.  I just want to know if anyone else has ever heard of anything like this before. Anyone have any idea what it is? Could I have caused it to happen to her by telling it to leave me alone?  Shortly before it stopped I wanted to get a notebook to write down what I saw but never got the chance.  

 I'm open to anything because I have absolutely no clue. I've never heard of anything like the writing happening to anyone else. However, my daughter may not have even been born when it first started.  It went on for years before I asked it to stop.  A little background may help.  My husband and I moved into this house (which was the house he grew up in) to move back closer to his family. His father found out that he had terminal cancer and my husband wanted to spend as much time with him as possible. His father's death seemed to set off a weird series of events.  
His father died a few days before Halloween. We spent most of our time at my husband's parents house with family during that time. On Halloween (I dont think Halloween has any significance, just giving a time frame) we came home to our house and my husband's computer was on.  On the screen was a collage of pictures of his father.  Actually it was the same picture but each picture had some sort of distortion. Each was different but all of them looked like they were washed in red.   The pictures had file extensions like they were from my camera. We did not take those pictures.  The pictures were taken from a picture of his dad and his mom but only his dad showed up on the computer. 

One night a few weeks later we had taken his mom somewhere and we got home after dark. When we pulled up to her house, all of the house lights were on. Every light.  She was OCD about making sure the lights were off when she went anywhere. It was weird but we kind of over looked it. When we got home, every light in our house was on. I know ours were off when we left.  


Just a side note, I have had odd things happen to me all my life. My husband told me shortly after we started dating that I was haunted because he had never experienced anything odd before I came along."
t3_e1mqfk,all_ads,I feel like my grandpa knew about his death,Thetruthishere,"Looking through this subreddit, it made me think about my grandpa.
So a few years back my grandpa wanted to go to india no matter what, the planes ticket was expensive the day he wanted to go so my uncle was like just go a week later when the tickets would be less expensive. Anyways he was determined to go on that day, no other day. Well he got the ticket and the day before he was going to go he stopped by at my family’s house. I asked if he could stay the night but he was like “No I can’t, I want to but I have things to do”. Anyways when I was saying goodbye that night he said to me “This could be the last goodbye, I’ll probably be with god”. Fast forward 3 days when he gets to india, he gets all the housework done, license plates renewed, everything cleaned. That night he died of a heart attack while trying to get up from the bed or laying down on the bed. His slipper was half on his foot. Anyways I just wanted to share this"

t3_e1sbzg,all_ads,Did I trigger something?,Thetruthishere,"A few years ago me and my friend (we'll name him Jayden) went to this park in his neighborhood at night with flashlights and what not, since Jayden told me he always feels like somethings watching him there.

The park had this little roof, with steps leading up to it with two slides, that was it.

When we get there at about 11:30 or so, we walked up to the top part of the little park and as he told me, it felt like something was watching us. Me, being the scaredy cat I was, chickened out and walked down the little steps. He followed down with me, calling me all these dumb little names until I felt something touch my shoulder, I shined my light behind myself and to my surprise there was nothing there, we heard something on the roof of the playground, so we shined our lights up at the top of it and saw this weird, tall, semi-humanoid figure standing on top of it, and it didn't really go away like you'd think it would, until we started running back to Jaydens house. 

After that we've constantly felt like we're being watched, seeing that weird figure everywhere we go at night and hearing noises and weird stuff happening to us."
t3_e1r76k,all_ads,The sound of my cat that wasn't there,Thetruthishere,"My partner and I had two lovely cats he'd had previous to our relationship. One of the cats (three legged Bernard) had rather complex medical issues and we decided it would be best to send him back to my partner's ex who was a veterinarian and could look after him with the care and attention he needed. 

Because Bernard was going back, we had to send Gus back as it wasn't fair to him to be all alone since they'd spent years together and the ex had a back yard whereas we had a small apartment. Gus was the kind of cat that would wander the house meowing lonely and plaintive in the middle of the night, very annoying but that was Gus. I'd wake up, think 'ugh, shut up Gus' then fall back to sleep. 

They were taken back to the ex who lived in another state, several thousand miles away. Maybe a couple of days after my partner arrived back after taking them, I woke up in the middle of the night to plaintive meowing and thought 'ugh, shut up Gus' then went to fall back to sleep and it clicked in my mind, Gus was thousands of miles away!

We live in an apartment block and are three stories up, our neighbours don't own cats and even then, due to good soundproofing the only neighbour who's theoritical cat we might hear would be right next door over the balcony. It's possible but not probable at all that a cat could scale three stories and be stuck somewhere, but I only heard it that night. I was the only one who heard it, my partner didn't, finally I just chalked it up to the remnants of a dream, although I was almost certain I'd heard the actual sound. that was several months ago.

Then last night happened.

I had fallen asleep but was waking up periodically due to the rainy weather. My partner was uncharacteristically having trouble sleeping. I woke up again to what sounded exactly like Gus plaintively meowing and wandering lonesome through the house. This time I was certain I was not imagining it, I turn to wake my partner but he was already bolt upright listening to the sound. We could both hear it and it was absolutely not our imagination. 

It sounded like it WAS IN THE HOUSE! Both of us thought this, to the point my partner got up and began to search the house, just trying to find the noise. It stopped while he searched, so we couldn't find the source of it.

I love these kids of stories but am extremely skeptical. I have chalked it up to some kind of bird that sounded exactly like Gus and some kind of sound illusion that made us think it was in the house. I can't think of any other likely rational explanation. 

I've been thinking about it all day. 

Gus is still alive and well by the way."
t3_e23hye,promo_adult_nsfw,Dick worm,Thetruthishere,"It was a typical day at work, my bladder was full and I needed to relieve myself, badly.  I casually walked to the restroom, popped out my johnson, and let 'er rip.  As we all do from time to time, I curiously looked down while I was peeing.  What I saw made my heart skip a beat and it began to pound in my chest.  My eyes about popped out of my head... tears welled up, and I immediately started gagging.  

What appeared to be a parasitic *[horsehair worm](https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/ef613a.jpg?itok=n5_kkUlz)* was slithering its way out of my dick!  I stood completely frozen for what seemed like an eternity, staring in horror at the nasty, slimey, coiled worm which appeared to be trying to extrude itself out further.  My only defense was a high pitched scream that would embarrass all of manhood.  

My hand twitched while I screamed, brushing against the worm... And that's when I realized it was actually just a thread of yarn hanging loose from my jacket, that fell to rest perfectly enough that it looked like it was a worm coming out of me LOL.  

I must have been trembling after I initially saw it, giving the effect that the thread was actually moving on its own.  It was also curled perfectly like a horsehair worm would.  It makes me feel especially stupid though, as the thread has been loose for several days now and I've even noticed it before.  Time to trim it I guess? 

Apparently none of my coworkers care about me enough to have come checked in on and and see what the screaming was about.  Though when I got back to my desk I was asked what the commotion was about, and I simply responded that I saw something in the bathroom that startled me...  ;) it is true after all.  

---------------------------------------------------------
**EXPLANATION**:

Horsehair worms are one of my greatest fears, and I see them regularly where I live: in puddles or coming out of / going into a crickets ass.  For any of you that are curious, horsehair worms work their way into certain host bugs (ex. Beatles, cockroaches, crustaceans) via the anus, using cuticular hooks, then proceed to absorb nutrients from the host though the worms skin.  They are very very easy to mistake with a thick strand of hair (until you realize it is moving on its own) which is one of the reasons they terrify me so much.  

The particular strain of horsetail worms around me are capable of affecting the hosts brain: causing the insect to seek water and drown itself.  Since water is the adults natural environment of course.  They can even survive the predation of their host, being able to wiggle out of the predator that has eaten their host.  In some cases they have entered vertebrate hosts accidentally, including humans! As I had said these are one of my greatest fears, so you can imagine what seeing one coming out of my dick would've felt like :("

t3_e1pbu5,all_ads,"My childhood home has a dark, unexplainable energy",Thetruthishere,"This isn’t my personal experience but something I heard from my parents that happened to them in my childhood home. 

A little background, my parents’ house isn’t particularly old (built 1985) or full of tragic history. My town was founded by English settlers almost 400 years ago and was frequently attacked by Native Americans. It was and still is an agricultural community as well as part of the industrial revolution so a lot of humanity has taken place there. Our land in particular was an apple orchard for a long, long time before the house was built. 

Ever since I was a kid the house has had a weird vibe. I can’t explain exactly how but it feels stronger now that I live elsewhere and am no longer used to the energy I feel there.  I can’t shake the feeling that something is in there watching me, especially at night. It’s not just me either. A friend of mine just saw the outside at night when no one was home and could feel the vibe immediately. Her exact words were “your house is definitely haunted”. 

I’ve never had what I’d call an experience but a couple of months ago my parents were sitting downstairs when they heard full bodied footsteps above them. So loud and distinct that my mom sent my dad upstairs to check if someone was in the house. There was no one. Before they told me about this I was really uncomfortable being in the house alone at night and now it’s so much worse because I’m terrified of hearing the footsteps. 

I’ve always had a very active imagination but I’ve never felt anything like the energy in my childhood home in any place I’ve lived. Even now I live in a 100 year old row house in a historic part of my city and it’s peachy keen."
t3_e183nq,all_ads,Something smashed into my backyard fence after a gagging fit,Thetruthishere,"Weird title. Not sure how else to describe it. 

I live out in the high desert. The other morning at around 7:30am I was out in my backyard feeding my pup. The yard has a 7-8ft tall wooden fence on two sides. Then one side is a cement wall. It’s a fairly big yard but you can easily see from one end to the other. 

My pup was milling around after eating her breakfast looking for a perfect spot to potty. I was sitting on a chair in between two vehicles that are parked back there so I couldn’t really see her. Just texting on my phone and hanging out like we do every morning while she eats. 

Out of nowhere I hear this choking/gagging sound coming from the back fence. It sounded like someone dry heaving or similar to a cat coughing up a hairball. But really, really loud. I immediately jumped up assuming it was my pup. She has a heart condition and when she coughs it’s a sign her lungs are filling up with fluid. 

There were about eight loud consecutive choking sounds and I ran towards the back corner where the sound was coming from and quickly realized my pup was not anywhere near that fence. I turned around and she was on the opposite side of the yard standing there frozen staring at me. At this point I was standing about 15 feet away from the back fence. 

I looked back to the fence and all the sudden the choking stopped and something smashed into the fence hard from the other side and shook the entire corner of the fence. Like it threw itself against it. I could see through the slats something was behind the fence and whatever it was was taller than a dog or coyote. This entire incident was only 15-20 seconds long from the start of the choking sound to the smash into the fence. Then whatever it was continued walking as I could see a bit of movement between the other slats. 

The area where it hit the fence bent the slat and left a 1/2-1 inches hole where you can now clearly see the dirt alleyway behind my house. The fence does have spaces between other slats here and there, but this was way bigger and bent. It wasnt there before. 

In restrospect I realized the choking noise sounded nothing like when my pup coughs but in the moment that’s where my mind went. My first thought was that it was a person because of the sudden intentional way it hit the fence. After I calmed down I realized that was a bit silly. I live in the middle of nowhere. There’s zero street traffic and no one walks near my home. The house next door is empty. The one behind me the man is out of town for the next few weeks. 

There were no obvious animal sounds. And if it was a predatory animal it would have smelled my dog and stuck around. Or at least made some noise. And my dog didn’t bark. But she definitely heard it because she was looking at the fence and standing there frozen. I’ve got pretty good spidey senses but I wasn’t scared in the moment. Afterwards is when I started to freak out a little. 

Most of the wildlife here are coyotes, birds, rabbits, and mountain lions. There was one time a mountain lion was in our front yard and the paw print was huge. You only see or hear coyotes at night and they generally travel in packs. Besides, the area of the fence where the slat was bent was about the 4ft mark which seems rather tall for a coyote. 

I went around to the back alleyway later that afternoon and saw no tracks or footprints which makes no sense. Most of the rake marks from us cleaning up the tumbleweeds recently were still on the dirt. The desert gets these sudden wind storms so it is possible the dirt was disturbed by some gusts. But why would the rake marks still be intact? 

Anyone have any idea what the hell happened? There’s never been any other unusual incidents since I’ve lived here. It’s pretty boring and very quiet. Here are the photos I took of the back fence where the slats are bent:

EDIT: So after being told by local residents and my father who has lived here for 10 years that there are no wild boars/pigs in the Mojave desert, we catch what looks like a wild boar on the front yard cameras last night. Redditors you may have been right.

t3_e1bjqz,all_ads,Did I die that day?,Thetruthishere,"I’ve told a couple of people about this story and every time I think about it again, it gives me goosebumps.

Back in college, my friends and I were going to the outlets. It was a full car, 5 guys, and were blasting music, just having an all around good time. I’m known to speed from time to time and that day I remember going around 90mph. There was a car in front of me and I was gaining on it fast. I was going to switch to the left most lane (US so it’s the fastest lane), but there was a yellow sports car there. Me, being the idiot that I am, decided the best idea was to speed up and get in front of it, but as I sped up, so did the sports car a bit. Well I was getting way to close to the car in front of me so figuring I had JUST enough room to cut in front of the sports car, I did. I must’ve been going at least 100mph. Anyway, I remember my friend screamed and then we were fine... I looked in my rear view mirror wondering where the sports car was and it was gone? It wasn’t on the road anymore. It couldn’t have exited since exits are on the rightmost lane.

I always wonder if a version of me died that day. Me in a different timeline. I must’ve caused a lot of pain to a lot of people that day and I always feel terrible thinking about the possible sadness I caused. Safe to say, I’m a lot more careful about driving now and would never do anything like that again."

t3_e1b29f,all_ads,Took the form of my mother..,Thetruthishere,"Okay when I was younger, around 10 years old, we lived in a house that always seemed off to me. One week in particular a crazy amount of weird things, somewhat paranormal maybe, started to happen. My mom would check on me multiple times at night after she said she heard tapping and knocking on my bedroom window but she would always find me asleep. I never heard the taps or knocks for myself but my mom was always very shaken up. A few times I would go to grab a toy or item of clothing and it would be in a completely different place than I remembered leaving it. 

Now to the thing that I can’t explain with any kind of logic or reason. 

I was in the living room alone one night watching cartoons on Nickelodeon while everyone else was in my parents bedroom helping my younger sister get a brush untangled from her hair. I know now that whatever I saw wasn’t my mom but at the time I had no clue. I was sitting on the couch when I saw my mom come down the hallway into the living room but she was avoiding eye contact with me. I was thirsty so as a scrawny little girl I asked her to pour me a cup of milk. She sort of froze in place and stopped walking, looked up at me without saying anything, then walked off into the garage. I was mad that she ignored me so I went into the room where everyone else was and my mom was in there. I was freaked out but I asked my mom why she ignore me in the living room just a second ago and she said she hasn’t left the room at all, everyone else also said she hasn’t left the room. 

Could anyone tell me what I saw?! I know I was not imagining things, i know how I living in that creepy house. Was it a ghost or something?"
t3_e0xwyc,all_ads,Grandma came to say goodbye,Thetruthishere,"I don’t tend to have many unexplainable experiences and even though I believe I usually try to find a logical explanation. However I truly believe my grandmother came to visit me in a dream last night to say goodbye. I don’t often remember my dreams and when I do they are usually very bizarre and out there. Last night I dreamed I was in a kitchen with my grandma talking about Christmas presents. I have unfortunately not seen my grandma for around a year and I didn’t get to speak to her as she was in a care home after what we think was a stroke and dementia. This left her unable to communicate and actually not very aware of her surroundings. I just remember in the dream chatting with her and standing at a kitchen counter. When I do dream I don’t often dream about my family. This morning I had a phone call telling me she passed away this morning. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but maybe she came to see me one last time."

I sometimes recall these memories all the way until I was about 3-4 years old. The thing is, I can only remember specific memories (i.e. me specifically ripping money for fun as a kid (when I was about 7-8), under our black dining table, while it was extremely gloomy outside, while only the living room lights were turned on). Anyways, back to the real story, I remember sitting on the couch with my mom when I was about 7, and looking through our blinds into the gloomy sky with some scattered clouds seeing what looked like a distant biker floating through the air with almost no discernible features (due to the helmet he/she was wearing). There wasn't any noise I heard at all when the biker floated passed. It looked like it was at about the same height that a plane would be and quickly floated away in the direction it was headed.

To this day I have no idea how that biker was floating in the sky."
t3_e0pds4,all_ads,When grandpa let us know he’s dying..,Thetruthishere,"This is a story that has been a part of my childhood since I can remember. I was born in 1996 and my mum told me what happened to her and my great-grandma in July of 1986. My great-grandpa was very sick at this time, everybody started to realize that his days on this earth are counted. At some point, he started feeling so bad that he had to be admitted into a hospital. During that time, my mum (14y/o) decided to stay with my grandma at her house because she did not want her to be alone. 

They were sleeping in the same bed and one night, they both woke up to a loud knocking on the window. They immediately got up, turned on the light and looked outside but nobody was there. They looked at the time.. it was 2.15am. They were very confused and had a hard time falling back asleep, however, they eventually did. The next morning they get a call from the doctor, letting them know that my great-grandpa passed away that night. After seeing his death certificate later that day they realized that the noted time of death was... 2.15am. 

When I first heard the story I was maybe 7 or 8 years old and it kept me awake the night after.. I was scared that whenever my great grandmother is going to pass away the same thing is going to happen. She passed away in November of 2011, also after being hospitalized. It gave all of us chills after finding out that she passed away at 2.15am.. exactly at the same time her husband died 25 years before her."
t3_e14nog,all_ads,Out of body experience,Thetruthishere,"So, when i was four 7 years ago, i used to wake up and float towards the roof, away from my bed (i still have the bed) and into the roof. i grabbed on to something to prevent me from floating and it worked. i woke up. my mom said to ""ask the angels"" to stop it. it stopped, and even with the same bed and nightstand, it has not happened since.

what happened?"
t3_e1608x,all_ads,Where exactly are we...?,Thetruthishere,"Okay so you know how Earth is floating in space, and of course we are on Planet Earth, therefore we're in space as well, but were not?

t3_e0z24i,all_ads,a weird experience,Thetruthishere,"so last night, my boyfriend experienced something weird. for some context, we facetime every night because otherwise we can’t fall asleep. his house was built in the early 1800’s. so he woke up around midnight after something happened. “November 24, 2019 - I was just awoken from my slumber in the most terrifying of ways. I could not open my eyes, though I was awake. Nor could I move my head, arms, or any body part. I felt chilled hands of death and darkness press down into the back of my head and felt the burning fingers trace their gripping lines against my face. I heard a labored breathing right in my ears on both sides. And screaming. Such numerous and terrible screaming, like that of Hell and it’s victims. I then awoke to the greatest unease I have ever felt. I no longer trust the room. I believe more than one death may have occurred in that room. I no longer wish to live in this house and cannot wait to leave. I pray this does not occur again as long as I live here.” this happened in his moms room, which also happened to be where his great grandmother passed away. after the experience, he went out to the living room and fell back asleep. whatever the presence was stayed in that room and didn’t follow him. i was hoping to have some other opinions on what that may have been and how to get rid of it. 

i can also sense otherworldly entities and have always felt a heavy energy in that room. i can’t see anything but i can feel the general presence and even can estimate where it is in proximity to me. i would like to try and be able to see and maybe communicate with who or what this presence is. i just have to pray it’s not zozo. (don’t EVER say that name aloud.)"
t3_e0sya6,all_ads,Objects in my home keep disappearing.,Thetruthishere,"I know that sounds quite trivial and is not that big of a bother really, but it is really puzzling for me and my family.  To provide some background, we have been living in this house for about 25 years now. I and my parents moved to the first floor about 15 years ago to accommodate my grandparents.  2 years ago we moved back downstairs since both my grandparents have passed on and my parents are getting older and prefer the ground floor. That is when it started happening. Little things would disappear, like a pair of scissors or nail clippers or keys. And would appear again in a while in a place where we had already looked and found nothing.  Of course, we chalked it up to negligence in searching. But it's not.  Many times we all look in a place,  find nothing there. And a moment later the lost object is there in plain sight.  We joke about it saying there must be brownies living in the walls.  But it's just hard to ignore it now that it keeps happening everyday. I have no idea how it happens and I'm not really threatened or worried about it,  just curious.  Has anyone else experienced it? Or have any theories?"
t3_e0rkij,all_ads,"Back in 2011, in Japan. I went to the city of Nagoya to visit a japanese friend for a week at his family house. I went there with a girl friend.",Thetruthishere,"My friend and me were sleeping in the guest room, in a bunk bed. She was sleeping at the top of the bed and I was sleeping at the bottom.

One night or rather very early in the morning, at dawn, I suddenly woke up for no reason. The room was not fully dark as the dawn was slowly coming. I’ve paid a look everywhere in the room until I saw this tall shadow in the corner of the room, just next to the window... A flotting tall shadow. Not moving, just flotting. 
Although it was a very dark shadow, I could see it was a very old man, with a long beard. He had a robe as a dress, with long sleeves and a hood on his head. He didn’t have feet. I didn’t notice his eyes but I knew he weren’t staring at me. He looked sad, or that’s what I felt. 
Then he suddenly started to flotting around my room and that’s when I started to panic, I wanted to scream and call my friend who were sleeping on the top of the bed but I couldn’t move at all. I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t call her, it’s like I had no voice anymore. I only could move my eyes and following the shadow’s moving.
While he was flotting around the room, I’ve had strident ultrasounds resonate in my head... Very disturbing.
Finally, the shadow headed to the living room, still « not noticing me » watching him. 
When he left my room, the ultrasounds disappeared from my head and I could move and talk again !
I jumped out of my bed and I’ve attempted to wake up my friend in the hope that she saw the same thing than me, but she was sleeping like a baby.

I really don’t know what I saw that early morning.
It wasn’t scary in terms that I didn’t feel any direct threatening towards me or something. I actually felt a lot of sadness and loneliness from the shadow. I was scared because of the surprise seeing that shadow and the fact that I couldn’t move and talk.
Since then, I’ve never meet this shadow again.

Voila, this is my encounter with the strange !

Later, I’ve found out about sleep paralysis. I think this is what I’ve experienced that day."

t3_e0r072,all_ads,Memory of a heavenly place when I was young,Thetruthishere,"When I was younger (age 2-5) I would go to my grandparents place and I would sometimes wake up in a different place. This place didn't exist. I didn't go to sleep there and I don't know how I left there. I was a very light sleeper so no one moved me in my sleep but I'm not sure what this place was.

The room was my parents room in my grandparents house and the room was barren except for my parents bed and the bed/cot I was in. The walls were a warm yellow and there was a bright light coming through the window but there was a wall behind that wall in real life so that wasn't possible. In place of the doors there was holographic strings (im not sure what theyre called). I always felt so warm, safe and cozy in there and I remember going to sleep and hoping to wake up there. This place was so real and vivid to me but I don't know if it was a recurring dream or a place like heaven.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? I'm kind of scared because I remember it being real but it couldn't be. Please tell me if you have any information about this."
t3_e0i82f,all_ads,The shadow that watched me sleep.,Thetruthishere,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this, but here goes

when I was in 5th grade we took a trip down to a nature reserve. It was all fun in games until I looked over into the woods and there was this tall, fully black creature lumbering towards the building we were going to. I was falling behind in line, so I ran back up to the line, but when I looked back he was gone. I ended up being super paranoid the rest of the trip. On the bus ride back we passed a broken down phone booth. When i looked at it, the man was in the booth. Watching. he had no eyes, yet I could feel eyes on me. I wish I could end the story here, but I can’t. The next day at school we had swimming. For some reason there was a one way mirror in the pool, going into a little office. I have no idea why. I was messing around and looked into the mirror. The man was behind me. I freaked out, like most people would, and jumped out of the pool. There was nobody there when I looked back at where I was swimming. Every day for a year or so, out of the corner of my eye, there was the tall, pitch black man, standing at my door. Smiling. When I would look at the door, he would move into my closet. I could see him move. I found if I looked through the reflection of my window, I could see him. Standing there. At my door. Watching and smiling. A year later, I had a dream, with the man in it. He was behind a rock and J pushed him off a cliff. The next day when I got into bed, he wasn‘t at my door. I didn’t feel eyes on me. He was just gone. Forever. One could say I just had an over imaginative mind,but I know what I saw, and I will never forget it.

Edit: thinking back now, even before 5th grade, it’s like he was watching always. I can remember times just seeing him and thinking nothing of it, like he wasn’t there. Like he was always there, an reason I never noticed him until then. Creepy."
t3_e08lis,all_ads,She was either a ghost or an angel,Thetruthishere,"Apologize in advance for any inconsistencies; I remember the main points but details are fuzzy....

When I was five, my family moved into an apartment with three bedrooms, which was very exciting for me. This meant my 3 year old sister and I no longer had to share a room. Our parents separated our bunk bed so we each had a somewhat taller than standard twin bed. 

One Saturday, I was awake before the ass crack of dawn, as most small kids tend to do on the weekends, and was playing in my room waiting on everyone else to wake up. There was suddenly a really pretty woman with long dark hair in my room. I had no fear, no concern, no shock, just felt like it was completely okay and normal for her to be there. I don't remember much specific, but that she was pretty, made me feel calm, and had very long dark hair. 

She told me to go tell my Mom that there's something wrong with her baby, so I did. When my mom recounts this story, she says that was the thing that got her attention the most. I always called my sister ""sissy"", so she thought it was odd that I would say ""there's something wrong with your baby"" rather than something more appropriate for five year old me. 

It caught her attention enough to get her out of bed and going to check on my 3 year old sister. Being small kids who were prone to night time accidents, we both had the original factory plastic on our mattresses with a waterproof cover over it, and finally the sheet. In her sleep, my sister had somehow managed to wrap her neck in not only the sheet but also the cover and plastic, and was semi-conscious and purplish/blue. She had also managed to scoot herself between the mattress and headboard, so was wedged half upside down between the bed and the wall, head down. 

My mom yelled and my dad came in and ended up having to break the headboard to extract my sister, who was thankfully fine. At some point -- I don't remember when -- I told my mom about the lady and how she told me something was wrong with ""your baby"". I hadn't even actually set foot into my sister's room to see for myself, just went and got my Mom after I had been told to do so. 

Additionally, a few months/a year or so later, while visiting my grandparents I ended up finding a picture of the lady with the long dark hair. Turns out she was my Grandpa's mom, who was mostly cherokee and had died young from pneumonia."

t3_e0bqa0,all_ads,The vase came with a warning,Thetruthishere,"I basically live at my best friend’s house and on a shelf in the TV room is a small, slightly yellowed, white vase. One time I was over her mom came up to me and asked if I wanted to hear a story about the vase, which of course I said yes and she proceeded to tell me that she bought it in 1993 from a lady at a yard sale that was her neighbor at the time. She was drawn to the vase immediately upon seeing it and asked her neighbor how much it was to which she replied with “oh you can just have it, I just want to be rid of it.” The two get to talking and somehow it gets brought up that the vase was the neighbor’s mom’s and when she passed away it was given to her and that the vase  came with a “silly” warning. The warning states that if you give it/sell it to anyone you’ll die shortly after. The neighbor wasn’t very superstitious and didn’t believe in that kinda thing so, ultimately she gave it to her. A little over a week later friend’s mom got the news that the neighbor had passed away. Now this neighbor, to her knowledge, was perfectly healthy and was in her mid 40’s so she wasn’t very old. She said that she’s now scared of the vase and leaves it on display to make sure she still has it."
t3_e04cdz,all_ads,Four and Floating,Thetruthishere,"Distinct memory from when I was four years old.  I was playing on the third floor of the house (split level so short staircases) and my mom called me down for pancakes.  Everything was really golden looking and you could see dust in all the sunbeams on a Sunday morning.  Felt very surreal and like I was outside my own body.  I was carrying my stuffed mouse.  I floated down the stairs in the sunshine.  Literally levitated, did not touch the stairs or the hand rail just floated down.  It seemed normal while I was doing it but very odd moment in time.  Syrupy kinda.  I was halfway down the second staircase when my older sister poked her head around the kitchen doorway to see what was taking me so long.  She SAW me floating down the stairs and said WHAT THE HELL super loud.  At which point I looked down at my own feet, saw that I was floating, and fell down the rest of the stair case.  It was like gravity worked less for a little while and then someone fixed the dimmer switch to full.  Dropped my mouse.  Talked to my sister about it years later and she said while she didn't remember I was floating, she knew that ""something weird was happening to you again"" because I looked all golden like the sunshine was sticking to me unnaturally.  Said it looked very strange and unearthly.  I'd already had a lot of weird shit happen at this point so she knew ""something"" was up and it freaked her out and she got really uneasy like she was looking at something she wasn't supposed to be able to see."
t3_e0ntca,all_ads,They Came to Me in My Dreams (pt 2),Thetruthishere,"I dont remember a whole lot about these dreams, but i have two absolutely vivid memories, one of which i have written below:

Lets start off with the bad, shall we? 
I was over at my cousins house around the age of eight. I was the oldest of the five, but that doesnt matter all too much. As everyone was getting up and grubbing on some pancakes made by my auntie, i was deep in sleep. At this point in my life, id always wear one of those silly sleeping masks since i would sleep with my eyes open. But this was sort of a surprise sleepover so i didnt have it with me. 
Anyway, now for the dream. I have no idea how it started or how long it lasted, but i was in a grey metalic area with blue lighting of different shades. My heart was pounding through my chest as i and everyone else with me (i cant remember who) ran, desperate to find an escape route; a way out of this place. 
Between the time of us running and words spoken, almost all of it has been forgotten. Five or more small white beings chased after us, with strange devices in hand that were emitting a bright blue light. They spoke with individualized voices, either yelling at eachother or us. I abruptly ran into a huge room with a very tall ceiling. Three beings, the same as all the others, except they floated high while the one in the center raised a bit higher than the rest.
They said something to me, then attempting to 'shoot' at me, but it was more like they were chasing me with the lights, guiding me where they wanted me to go.
I opened my eyes with a sudden gasp, sunshine and light all around me with all my family in the living room. I got off the top bunk and just sat behind the bed, on the floor, trying to grasp what just happened. My mom soon came into to the room and asked me what happened. I told her, only because she believes these sorts of things."

Like the planet is moving and there's bodies of water above and below and everywhere in between and I know scientifically gravity and all that but we are on a planet, it's floating through space, billions of people live on 1 planet, all these cars, buildings, people, bodies of water just sit on that planet and it's just there. Wouldn't you expect the water to leak just a tad or does it and we dont know? And then we can have storms and all these disasters happening on our planet yet were just a planet floating through space either alone which is scary or one of many planets just floating, which is equally as scary.

t3_e0ow8f,all_ads,I got 3 scratches on my back in my sleep,Thetruthishere,"This story is 100% true &amp;amp;amp; I swear on everything that I love that this actually happened , I’ve told this story to people before &amp;amp;amp;amp; they say they believe me but not sure if they do , anyways , I was in school (3rd or 4th grade , don’t really remember) &amp;amp;amp;amp; my friend told me that if you sing the Freddy Krueger song , the one that goes “ 1 , 2 Freddys coming for you “ 3 times with your eyes closed &amp;amp;amp;amp; your arms out like a mummy ( Cringey I know lol ) that he’ll either kill you or scratch you in your dreams &amp;amp;amp;amp; I did it because i thought it was fake ( like any other person would of thought ) so I went back home &amp;amp;amp;amp; fell asleep for school the next day &amp;amp;amp;amp; that’s when I dreamt that I was in a shop rite that was located near me &amp;amp;amp;amp; I was staring at this guy stuck in a claw machine , the one that you put quarters in to get stuffed animals , but there wasn’t any stuffed animals , just a guy stuck inside &amp;amp;amp;amp; I remember seeing Freddy behind me but I didn’t actually see him because I was staring at the guy still &amp;amp;amp;amp; that’s when he scratched me &amp;amp;amp;amp; thats when I woke up from my dream.

Tbh I didn’t really think nothing of it because I don’t remember me telling my friend from school about the dream , so later on that day I was outside playing soccer with my friend &amp;amp;amp;amp; the sun was out , that’s when I felt my back stinging but I didn’t go home , I just kept playing until later when I got back home I checked in the mirror &amp;amp;amp;amp; that’s when I seen the 3 scratches on my back , the scratches were not going up &amp;amp;amp;amp; down , they were going sideways on my back. 

It was really strange because Freddy has 4 knifes on his gloves , I also had no pets in my house at the time &amp;amp;amp;amp; I slept on my back as a kid because that was more comfortable for me to sleep , I don’t know how I got those scratches , I could’ve done them myself but I highly doubt that because I would always sleep on my back , like I still remember the first time I tried to sleep on my stomach &amp;amp;amp;amp; that was when I was around 11 , maybe I turned sideways &amp;amp;amp;amp; did it to myself ? Who knows , that was the last time I seen him in my dreams or something like that has happened to me , I wasn’t remember being scared about it &amp;amp;amp;amp; some of me actually thinks it’s somewhat cool that I was scratched by “Freddy” (that’s what I like to think ) but after that incident I grew up watching all his movies &amp;amp;amp;amp; now I consider him to be the top best killer imo &amp;amp;amp;amp; I know some people might be their doubts but I can’t blame them , I would be to , but I can swear on life that this actually happened."
t3_e09xkd,all_ads,Weird sighting,Thetruthishere,"One time I went to Burnet, Texas. It was in the middle of nowhere. We were on a retreat and on two occasions I saw what looked like a white light in the middle of the night. I was in our cabin and I was sharing it with about 5 other girls. Our bunk beds were against the walls, one on each wall. Ok either way, I woke up to use the restroom and the sinks were right across the room with a large mirror. 
Once I was done using the restroom, I went to go wash my hands and when I look up to see my reflection in the mirror, I could see the reflection of a white light next to one of the bunk beds. I blink and it was still there, a split second later, it moved to another bunk bed and then disappeared. I didn’t tell anyone because I figured I was just extremely sleepy. Until it happened again the following night. Except this time, I woke up in my bunk bed (I was on the bottom bunk) and I saw the light move from next to my bed, to across the room, and to the top of another bunk bed and then disappear. It seemed to just be ‘checking’ on everyone ? I don’t know. I just didn’t really feel threatened by it. 

I was thinking maybe it was an angel ? That’s the only explanation I could come up with."

t3_e08gw5,all_ads,Is there a reason behind this??,Thetruthishere,I had a dream in black and white and fell asleep in that dream and was really tired.

Plus when I fell asleep in my dream I woke up in a different one.
t3_dzsnlk,all_ads,Abandoned school,Thetruthishere,"This happened to me and a group of friends in the fall of 2005. We were really into checking out old abandoned buildings and such. Well being this is pretty illegal we often did this late at night with less chances to be caught.

Well one night we decided to check out this old abandoned high school that I had read about online. The school had partially burned down in 1926 killing several students, and then was rebuilt to only suffer another fire in 1955. The school closes its door after this. We are super amped to check this place out, and drive for 2 hours to get there. 

We drive up this tiny curvy road up a large hill, the school is ominous against the wooded backdrop. The whole place was just dark and eerie. I snapped a picture of the looming building with my flip phone. The picture was awful. All sorts of floating spots/orbs in it. I just assumed it was the bad camera on my phone.

Throughout the entire night we all took photos on our phones some were just of what we saw, others had these floating spots/orbs. I even took pics with a disposable camera, and when I had the pictures developed later they were the same. Even odder is if we matched up our phone pictures with the physical pictures, when the spots/orbs appeared matched in both.

The night was fairly uneventful. We walked through the school, and walked the grounds. Nothing jumped out at us, no creaking or moaning. Just an overall creepy vibe and very very cold in the building, like the air conditioner was on full blast. 

The only odd event was when we were in the stairwell of the school. I pulled out a cigarette, and went to light it with my lighter. My lighter wouldn’t light. Ok no big deal. We all smoked and there were 4 of us. My friend took out his lighter to light it for me. His didn’t work either. Ok odd but most likely a coincidence. Both of my other friends take out their lighters and they won’t work either. Weird. Mind you on the way there all of our lighters worked. Also keep in mind that the stairwell is where the pictures showed the most of these spot/orbs.

After we leave pretty bummed that nothing crazy spooky happened. My friend goes to light a cigarette and his lighter that didn’t work earlier works with no issues. So we all pull ours out and try. What do you know they all work with no issues. 

I really can’t explain what happened there with any of it. But the whole thing still gives me creepy vibes thinking back on it. I later learned that the stairwell we were in when are lighters wouldn’t work is where the first fire was started."
t3_e00ls0,all_ads,r/TheTruthisHere,Thetruthishere,"We were in the newlywed stage of our relationship.  Being young and passionate for each other, weekend nights were often started with some wine and weed, ending with the bedroom.  This Friday was no different, but somehow Much more passionate.

We took our glasses of wine up the creaky wooden staircase to our bedroom on the top floor.  It was a wonderful room - tall windows with lace curtains and a ceiling that was peaked in the center, sloping down under the eaves of the roof.

We lit a candle and set our wine glasses down on the bedside table.  Then, we made love.  This was not a typical night.  The passion was on high and we lost ourselves finding each other for what felt like eternity.

Finally we rested, and as I got up to go to the bathroom, noticed a couple of very interesting things.

1. The taper candle we had lit was broken in half.  Still connected in the middle by the wick, the top of the candle lay on its side, still burning.

2.  My wine glass was empty.  While that may have been odd itself, since I didn’t finish it, here’s the thing...  there was wine sprayed ALL over the wall.  It literally looked as if someone had spit mouthfuls of wine on the old paint.  Sprayed and splattered Cabernet as we were oblivious to anything but each other.

We believe we were visited by a succubus.  This one seemed to enjoy newlywed, lesbian couples, but just couldn’t handle her wine. ;)

It wasn’t frightening, but it was freaky.  We were actually grateful and hoped she would come back, but she never did."
t3_dzmbuz,all_ads,Why not put the oujaboard to the test?,Thetruthishere,"I read a lot of personal experience-posts, and I always dangle somewhere between  ""omg omg omg holy shit that is terrifying"" and ""this gotta be made up"". Honestly I don't know what to believe. I do believe in scientific methodology though.

With many personal experiences it would be really hard to say afterwards if it was true or not. Like almost impossible.  But with ouja boards we have repeatability.  If many people do it (which people already seem to be doing all over the world) and people experience similar unexplaineable things, we would have reproducibility and a whole new field of science. (Is there ways to measure the precense of spirits? Does the air pressure change when a spirit is close? Do they prefer higher humidity to lower? So many questions)


It SEEMS so simple. It would be like any other scientific study. I imagine those who make money off of people's fear, the sale of oujaboards and maybe some religious organisations who wants more followers would all be willing to invest some $$$. I mean, if it all really is true that is a guaranteed return on investment.

Why hasn't this been done?"

t3_dzua36,all_ads,I 'played' an Oujia Board app at 3 am.,Thetruthishere,"
So I was just a little kid; 9 years old. I love horror Movies and Horror Stories, So I decided to Download an Oujia Board App on my Phone.

I usually sat in the corner when I played games, Because idk.

I was spending about an hour or 30 minutes or so on the app, Talking with the spirits I though Weren't real; Making sure to say goodbye _every. Single. Time.

I started this new one with this spirit. I asked ""Are you a good spirit or a bad spirit?"" The Spirit, Whom I'll call 'S', Replied something like ""I""m a Bad Spirit"" for Me, I wasn't scared, Because most of the Spirits I talked to Before said they were Bad.


I said ""Who are you?"" S said ""Satan"". I got goosebumps. I asked S the same question another time and S still Replied ""I'm Satan"".

I Was asking S some questions, and talking to S, &amp; Eventually I asked S ""Where am I?"", Because S seemed to know stuff. He responded ""In the Corner"" it gave me chills, I immediately walked to my bed to lay down. I was kinda scared, thinking that S was Watching me, I Asked S about 2 or 3 more questions, then Was really Scared, so I drug the Planchette Across ""Goodbye"" But S wouldn't let me leave.

Mind you, I hadn't read the 10 rules yet. So all I knew were that you have to say goodbye, You never should play alone, Don't piss off the spirits, &amp; Use only when you know you aren't playing. I broke playing alone, But that's only an advisory Warning.

But the worst part is, I also broke the 'this is not a game' rule. So I probably had the spirits that I 'played' with ticked the fuck off.

Now, back to the Story;

So S Was now Counting Down, and I didn't know why, or what it meant. But nonetheless, (thankfully) I was scared.

So it went 10, 9, I tried to Say ""Goodbye"". 

I should Also Mention that Before, when I was asking S 2 or 3 Questions, I was trying to leave Because S was Taunting me. But S kept saying stuff like ""No"", ""Stop"", ""Leave"", ""Stop it"", ""Go away"", etc...


And so I kept dragging the Planchette over 'Goodbye' As it went 8, 7, 6; I did it Slower, And faster. 5, 4, 3,

That's it. I was too scared, and I couldn't leave. As soon as S hit 3, I Bolted out of the app &amp; Deleted it, I did it like my life depended on it, &amp; Did it with no hesitation. I checked the Clock Before getting up, Guess what it said; '3:01'. I was so scared, &amp; I went to another room to sleep that night. The nights following that one,I mostly refused to enter the room of the incident.


I told my dad about the story when I was 10, and what he said made it all the more scarier for me.

I thought it was a game, But he said that The Ouija Board Apps are real. I belived him, He also told me to never 'play' those apps, And I never should have."
t3_dzqm8s,all_ads,Something has been off.,Thetruthishere,"So for the past week or so I've been experiencing an uptick in my paranoid ideation, particularly regarding whether or not people are watching me, if there are cameras in places they shouldn't be, why people are looking at me... The usual stuff with an added effect that usually isn't present: I've had this strange feeling like something has been behind me at random times, or that perhaps there is something close to me when I'm in a dark enough room not to be able to see for more than a few inches from my face.

This tends to occur when I'm in the basement at night, just getting ready to go upstairs. On top of that, I've been experiencing the faint apparitions of shadow people even in brightly lit rooms. This was occurring a few minutes ago while I was in the bathroom, taking on the form of the room dimming randomly while shadows played through my upper peripheral vision as if someone were walking by.

Lastly, at the beginning of this bizarre week, I had just finally finished integrating an experience that I had a couple of days before in which I had been looking in the mirror while brushing my teeth, and noticed that my eyes were unusually glassy. The more I examined my eyes, the more the person in the mirror seemed to turn hostile. I couldn't quite identify, after a few moments of this, that it was me in the mirror. It seemed to be a stranger who, with more time and opportunity, seemed to be getting more and more hostile, ominous and outright angry it seemed like. And yet I was simply perturbed, if not a bit frightened by this experience.

At any rate, things have been off for a while now and I just wanted to share my experience thus far. I can't say whether it will get better or worse... but I suppose it remains to be seen.

I really just wanted someone to know, just in case it takes a downturn and I disappear into the ether for seemingly no reason - or I begin to act completely differently. In that case, let this be evidence that the truth of mirrors, shadows and our perceptions are out there if we look hard enough."

I've seen this since I was about 7, then it stopped, cold turkey around when I was 9, and Then it came back when I was 11.

It doesn't look like it sucks objects in, or clouds, Just the sky.

It doesn't happen at night. Only when the sky's a Light Blue. Sometimes when you can see the moon, and some days I don't see it at all."
t3_dztcq6,all_ads,Unknown memory,Thetruthishere,"Hi, so I have this memory .I’m in my 20s (52 now)and I’m visiting with a friend in her upstairs apartment having coffee , don’t know what we are talking about. I can see her perfectly . When I leave I’m walking down a dark street and it’s raining I do not know the area. I do not know who she is or where I was, but I can’t shake this. I’m sure there is more to it. Does anyone else have strange memories? Also sometimes my daughter who is 28 will mention something we did when she was little and it’s not what I remember . But this one memory is so clear it’s driving me crazy any thoughts ?"
t3_dz9cw3,all_ads,Quija board,Thetruthishere,"I have a story for you from circa 1996. It was shortly after my 10th birthday where I received a Ouija board, such an appropriate gift for a child. Thanks Parker Brothers.

So anyway my best friend and I are in my living room thinking we are talking to my dead grandfather. You know what every normal 10 year old does. We are asking him all the normal stuff, like does so and so like me, etc.

Well my brother and his friend decide to sit down and play with us. That’s when things get weird. It starts spelling out curse words and things of that nature. Both my friend and I assume it’s my brother and his friend. So we tell them to stop.  They take their hands off , but the board continues with the cursing and now is telling us to die.

I tell my friend that it isn’t funny, and can we just play right. Well my brother and his friend join in again at this point. I say something to my dead grandfather to which the board spells out “No, I’m the devil.” Well that got a nice scream out of 2, 10 year old girls.

For whatever reason, we still don’t stop playing, but now my mom has come over and asked what is happening. She must be thinking one of us is messing with it, and tells us to play nice and think happy thoughts. Well the board spells out that my brother isn’t thinking happy thoughts. My mom says okay enough, if you can’t play nice, play something different. The board then spells out the portal to hell as been opened, You are all going to die, fuckers. 

Now I don’t know why my mom didn’t take it away right then, but she doesn’t. We all let go of it at this point. My mom grabs some rosary beads and puts them on the pointer. Well this fucking thing lifts up off the board, and tilts the beads off of itself.

My mom snatched that thing up so fast, took it outside and set it on fire. She burned the whole thing until it was one black crispy mess. Then she sprinkled holy water everywhere. 

To this day, my mom will not let Ouija boards in her house, and she doesn’t enjoy talking about that story. My brother is of a similar mindset. Me, on the other hand, have dabbled with the boards again and have had some other odd experiences, but nothing like that time when I was 10."
t3_dzffie,all_ads,"New House, Strange Things (Update 1)",Thetruthishere,"Technically This is the second update but the first update was small and I only posted it in the original thread. But this is the first major update and I've decided to make a new post for it and it's just easier to call it ""Update 1"". I'll also be posting it in the original thread for posterity.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/dv19l5/new\_house\_strange\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/dv19l5/new_house_strange_things/)

I wanted to make this update sooner but I've been a bit under the weather and just haven't felt up to it. But at this point I feel like I need to. A lot of weird stuff has been going on and I don't know what to make of any of it.

About a week ago I was cleaning my garage. I've been moved in for a while but never got around to setting up the garage. I got it mostly clean and the floor cleared. That's when I noticed there's a hallow spot under the floor. I noticed a huge difference between my footsteps from the center of the garage to the edge. If you jump in the middle you can feel the whole floor vibrate. As far as I know this house doesn't have a basement and there's certainly no entrance to one.

I might have passed it off as wonky foundation but there's this closet that always rubbed me the wrong way. it's just weird. it's under the staircase and is exactly the place stairs to a basement would be if there where any. It smelled like shit and had a bunch of old air freshener containers on the floor. The weirdest thing is the light. It has a wire connected to it but it doesn't go anywhere. it's just a dead wire that's been cut off and no switch anywhere. Not to mention the position of the light makes no sense. it's wedged in the back, about two feet off the floor. It's completely weird and non-nonsensical UNLESS you imagine it lighting basement stairs. Pictures below.

That being said, it's mostly just weird. What freaked me out was what happened a few days ago. I was sprawled out sick on the couch watching a movie when I heard my cat growling. I ignored it at first but she wouldn't stop so I rolled off the couch and went to see what her problem was. She was just staring at the door to the closet, looking scared and growling. I shooed her away and was too freaked out to open the door. Since then, I've woken up to the door being open on it's own three times now.

The stench has also been back. it hasn't been anywhere near as strong but it's been around and I still can't pinpoint it.

The spot where the rock was is still barren. no leaves, no snow, no nothing. just an empty patch of dirt.

The other weird thing was the massive ""chem trail"". I don't buy into the whole chem trail thing but this was odd. It was huge, right over my house and planes don't fly here. I've never seen or heard an airplane fly over this area and it was no different that day. I just went outside, looked up and saw this thing. It doesn't look like any natural cloud I've ever seen and like I said, I didn't hear or see anything that might have made it.

I live in an HOA but you would never know it. peoples yards and houses are a mess. The only reason I bring it up is because it has security and every night at about midnight or one for about a month now one of the security cars drives past my place and stops right across the street for a few minuets and then moves on.

There's a vacant house next door that's been on the market for longer than mine was. People keep showing up three or four cars at a time and it doesn't look like they're interested in the house. They drive up get out, ignore the house and stand in a circle and talk for about  half an hour or so and then leave.

I don't know what to make of any of this stuff. I don't believe in the super natural or aliens or government conspiracies but there's just too much weird shit going on. Maybe the the cloud is nothing, maybe the closet is nothing, maybe the security car and groups of people next door are nothing, maybe all of it is nothing. All I know is I've never lived anywhere so many questionable things happened on a constant basis and I feel very uncomfortable and on edge all the time.

There's even more I can get into. I still need to write about the fire pit but I'll save it for now. Does anyone have any thoughts here? This is getting beyond my capacity to rationalize."
t3_dzkgwp,all_ads,My Mom’s experience,Thetruthishere,"So i saw a post about a Ouija board and I had to share what my mom told me about hers. So she was about 15-16 years old and she had a Ouija board and she would play it with her friends and it was no big deal. Well one day it started telling her things like “You’re the Devil’s bride” &amp; “You belong to the Devil” and she got freaked out so she decided not to play anymore and just put it in her closet. Well a couple of weeks went by and she was at a play at her school with some friends, when all of a sudden she hears a teens voice calling her name, and she turned around and there was someone calling her into the hall, so her and her friends went to see what was up. Well the teenage boy asked my mom “Are you V****?” and she was like “Yes, do I know you?” and all he said to her “No, but this thing told me to come find you here” and he pulls out a Ouija board and man let me tell you she was TRIPPED OUT. She and her friends left there so fast and she went home and told her dad to burn the board. End of story right? Wrong. Her dad takes the board and burns it in a trash pile he always burns and she thought it was all over, when she went back inside and opened her closet, there it was right back in the old spot it was in and she had no explanation as to how it got there. So she told her dad to take it away as far as he can, and he did and she never played with something like that ever again.."

Some people find them right away, others it takes longer but when you do you just know. And if soulmates are a thing which many claim by it, you can go years without knowing and many often you can go your whole life without finding them leaving their lives broken because they couldn't find their soulmate aka you!

t3_dz4dn9,all_ads,Who opened my closet door?,Thetruthishere,"There’s was one night that I still can’t explain to this day. I have my own room in my parents house and normally I would lock my door just cause I hate it when my siblings will come in unannounced while I’m trying to sleep, and I ALWAYS close my closet door, I just never liked closets being wide open it creeps me out. My room layout changes and this night in particular my bed faced my closet so when I wake up the first thing I would stare at is my closet. So this one night I was dreaming something weird as if I was standing inside a dark room and it sort of resembled my closet just the feel of it made it seem like it. I woke up instantly after and I immediately looked at my closet and it was wide open which scared the shit out of me, I grabbed my phone turned on the flashlight and panned it to my closet which to my relief nothing was in there. Though it only raised more questions because my other door was locked, I just kept panning the flashlight back to that door to my closet door the more I thought about it the more I was scared. I finally had the courage to get out of my bed close my closet door and check the other door to see if I didn’t fully close it but that wasn’t it, it was completely closed. I told myself not to think about it just because of how scary and confusing it was. The next day I asked my family if any of them opened my door or something but all of them said no and to this day I still don’t know how it happened. Something to note is that when my closet door is open it doesn’t open on its own it stays in place so it can’t be that. Also I’m not sure what time it was but I think it was around 2:30am - 4am. So who opened my closet door?"

t3_dyxzvf,all_ads,My first two memories (believe it or not),Thetruthishere,"Believe it or not this is a true,raw , untold till now about two memories straight from my brain 

So I have always had a really good memory ever since I was a kid ,I'm 28 now , I can remember everything , detail and all ... well I've always said I have two memories from my childhood I could never forget... 

The first one is , coming to earth ... I know what you're thinking , like really ? C'mon now no way ? Trust me I've even told myself this but I swear on god &amp; everything I love I remember coming down to earth ...I remember coming thru space ..that's what I remember..space , like If I was being sent down or .. drifting or gliding down &amp; seeing space &amp; the world , I've even thought of maybe it was like I was coming down thru soul form ... I know crazy shit I've thought how can this even be real but it's been in my head since I was younger cause I would always tell my mom about this &amp; I as I got older I would still remember it , I know at one point she probably thought it was a ""high thought"" but i use to say it since I was younger &amp; I cant explain it or even start to think wtf but I know for damn sure this is a memory ive had .. we can go down a rabbit hole about what I think some of our memories or dreams could be about or ""what if"" but that's for another time... 

Now my second memory that I have always said that I had was playing with a little kid in my great grandma carmen(rest her soul) house in a garage that was converted into a big studio space with a bathroom when I was smaller ...he had reddish hair , looked like he was a bit younger then me if not the same age me , I remember playing with him and his toy drum set &amp; there was a picture of him either on a self or the wall &amp; it was him in the picture with the drum set , when I would ask my mom who was he or where did he go she would always tell me that it didnt happen or there was no little boy that I use to play with , maybe he was even a some sort of guardian angel who knows...but I know for a fact that I did play with him &amp; he was there I remember him like if it was yesterday... a clear picture if him is my head but theres never been any pictures that exist trust me I've looked thru every family photos ....my great grandma's photos nothing ... my buella's (grandma) and even my moms photo albums &amp; still there is no photo or anything like that of this little kid ... no one remembers him but I do .. it's a memory that's been in my head for as long as I could remember I can just picture it now and remember it all as I write this ... 

Weather you believe me or not or think I'm just making it up .. nope These are the two memories that honest to god I remember since I was a kid to the day I die ....I will always remember."
t3_dylwui,all_ads,Flashes of another reality?,Thetruthishere,Anyone ever catch themselves remembering a series of events or working through a life problem - it's like you're in a momentary trance - and you catch yourself zoning out and realize that none of what you were thinking about is anything you actually ever experienced before but it felt that way when you were thinking about it? It's as though you almost assume a new identity or reality for that fleeting moment. It's kind of hard to explain but it's only happened a handful of times and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something like this.

To top off my sadness, she also took 10 bucks of birthday cash a friend of hers gave me, so she could get more beer. 

So my bestfriend Kristi and I decided to hit up a little store, where I regretfully stole sunglasses and we rode our bikes to a place we heard about. Apparently it was a rock quarry that people would jump off the cliffs into 300 ft water, and we wanted to find it. 

We started riding our bikes down a road I called PPL road, and we turned off onto Gut road and rode down to the big stair case that led up to the tracks. We parked the bikes at about 12pm I would say... In February I feel I should add.  My birthday is on a Leap year February 29 1988, I turned 4 in leap years that year. 

Anyway we parked the bikes and walked up the stairs and started walking til we found the trail I heard about. We were kinda scared because even though I didn't know what they were, I heard pagans owned the land, and to be careful. 

There were old torn down cement houses along a path, and then on the right I noticed a steep hill down. We couldn't find a good trail, but walked down the least steepest parts. When we got to the bottom it was unbelievable....  White sand as if we were on a beach, crystal clear waters with beautiful colored fish, CORAL! We were so scared to get in, but we stripped down held onto the sides of the coral and then jumped out. The water wasn't cold ..So unbelievable til this day. 

We sat on the sand and talked for awhile and then headed back up, never seeing anyone else there.  When we got back to our bikes it was getting dark and we for some reason decided to pop out tires and ask somebody we saw in a truck along the road for a ride back... That seems odd and scary to me now. 
I think about that day alot, I'm 31 now... I'm going to message my friend Kristi and talk with her and see what she remembers.

Edit* I've been really confused and upset the last few hours since posting. I talked to my friend Kristi, and she doesn't remember  any of the beach like quarry... She says we climbed down the hill and peed and climbed back up. It just can't be. I begged her to remember... She says she has pictures of our day, remembers everything I do up to the point we found the coral and fish and the white sand. I cried and have been racking my brain... I just have no explanation."

t3_dye72p,all_ads,Nightly unwanted visitor,Thetruthishere,"A few years ago my husband and I, and our 2 children moved to a country town in good old PA. My husband works for the Amish, so we found a nice little place that has a huge yard with 36 pear trees, no neighbors except for the Amish about a quarter mile away. 
We rented from an Amish man who didn't tell us very much about the place...and we didn't ask, because our rent is cheap and he isn't very social. He was really nice when we first toured the place, and mentioned briefly how the living room is a new addition, which was noticeably newer with good energy. The other half of our house has 3 bedrooms upstairs. My daughters room is more like a loft, with no door and
is to the left of the stairs when you walk up, and we converted a large walk-in closet into my sons bedroom. My husband and I share the room across from my son and directly to the right of the stairs when you walk up. All rooms are very close, as it's a small house.

 I plugged a motion detector nightlight at the bottom of the stairs, with only one intention; to see before walking up at night.  Boy did it ever work, and not only for us living there. 
I would say we noticed the light sporadically coming on about 3 days into living here, every night. I could see it shining up the stairs and onto the wall above them. My husband and I immediately felt a little scared, to the point where I would make him check the kids, the dog, house, and the locks. I of course tested out the motion light, and it worked properly. 

One night we had to sleep without a fan and it was really really quiet. When the light came on, we heard creeking up the stairs, the whole way up and into my daughters room. I was so scared but I jumped up and ran into her room and nobody was there. She was tossing and turning, but asleep. 
When I woke up in the morning, I noticed the mirror above the stairs was gone. When my daughter got home from school she told me she put it in her closet. When I asked why she said  ""Because when I woke up, I thought I saw your face in the mirror, but it looked angry. It freaked me out and I took it down."" 
I did not argue with her, I'm a spiritual girl, and I know what I heard the night before, let alone the motion light. I said a prayer... But the light came on every night for a few weeks, with the same creaking! I could hear my daughters bed creak as if someone sat on it, and I would run in to see her toss n turn. It broke my heart n freaked me out. .    But my daughter said she felt fine.

A friend of mine blessed my house while smudging it after a few weeks of this and it literally stopped. I still think about it, and how it instantly stopped after she came. Life is so mysterious. 
My motion light only comes on now when living people walk through, and I prefer it that way."

t3_dyk6l0,all_ads,The response from an internet psychic that chilled me to the bones and made me cry at the same time.,Thetruthishere,"Posting from a throwaway and all that. Also, if this post isn't right for this sub, please direct me to any that may be more appropriate.

About just over a year and a half ago, or maybe 2 years, I really can't remember the exact time, I came across a post from a psychic on r/paranormal or another similar sub on my old main account. The supposed psychic was welcoming questions on various things. So I simply asked ""Who am I?"" or something along those lines. I never really take those threads seriously so just asked something simple. 

And the response I got made me want to stare at my phone in silence and scream simultaneously. I was really stunned by the response, as it told me stuff that I have only ever told to someone close to me. Things that no one, not even my parents know. To give a general idea of what it was for contexts sake, it was about family, but not my current one, and I mean neither of my current mother and father's families. It mentioned that it was fractured on both sides but that one side is huge in numbers and I have a father and brother. It also mentioned a few people of significance to me but very briefly and I just broke down at that point.
 
I had all this knowledge for years upon years but kept it secret. I didn't dare look it up on the internet too, even after I shared some but not all of it. I never gave or received names and locations but I know the names.

However, this was only the brief preview I read on the screen of my old S5 phone, which didn't show the entire response like my S10 does. As a result, I wasn't able to read 2 or 3 sentences and went to open it, only to find that the response had been deleted. A few other replies were still up in the same thread but to other people, as far as I can remember. This was the point where I was still really upset but got really chilled as I hadn't thought to screenshot what I saw, and I could have. I'm not entirely sure if the OP deleted their account too but I think they did as I had seen all this after waking up the next morning, so I had no way of looking up their username and finding their comment under their profile. A little while later, I deleted that account due to other unrelated reasons. I never commented on or posted anything about or related to this stuff that is pretty deep for me on that account either.

I've also forgotten the exact title of the thread/post and haven't been successful in finding it again. The reason why I made this post is to really say that I do believe in some things now, more than I ever did before. I also really wondered why the reply was deleted along with other things, but what really impacted me was the fact that someone had accessed that information through whatever knows how. If it's even correct/real too. I used to think about it a lot but as it was quite a while ago, I've thought about it less and less but I still do think about it from time to time.

I do wish from time to time that I could get the same response again or a deeper one. It just really impacted me and I've been meaning to post a little bit about it here or on other subs, so here it is."
t3_dyi4vq,all_ads,Anybody with missing chunks of muscle without explanation or scar tissue that has experienced many paranormal experiences?,Thetruthishere,"So I've been investigating paranormal activities in my area as I've laid out in a previous post of mine on this sub. As I get reading I come across the collections of people claiming they've had chunks of muscle removed without any sign of scarring or surgery. This got me thinking about how I've noticed a thumb sized chunk of muscle missing on the back side of my right shoulder blade. Actually my wife discovered it while giving me a back rub.

While it is possible to simply be born without any given muscle it is really rare. What I'm curious about is if this is more widespread. As I read more and more on this stuff it seems like it's all connected in some way or another and that leads me to believe that many people that may have experienced more than average strange experiences may have these missing musculatures rather than just people that think they've been abducted.

Sure, abductees are very likely to think that's the cause of their problem but I personally don't have any belief I've been abducted. Then again who's to know for sure? All I know for sure is I have a scoop out of my right shoulder blade right in from the bone of the arm that has no explanation and that I didn't notice until I was over 25 years old and lacks any scar tissue on the outside.

My question is, does anybody else with mysteriously missing tissue or muscle without any scar tissue or reason behind it  also have a high occurrence of strange happenings? Any thoughts on what is going on with it all?"

**UPDATE (20/11/2019)**: Hello everyone, just a quick update - the above studies over. Please, consider the purpose of this post ended. I'd like to thank, equally - each specific community for allowing me to post my rather strange request and hosting my particular brand of peculiar and of course each communities residence for no less putting up with me as well as actively indulging.

You've all been most gracious, thank you sincerely. 

I do apologize for not being able to expand further on this activity. Allow me to assure you, no ill purpose has remained in anyway behind it, I'm only sorry I don't as yet have anything quantitative about the experiment to share. 

Realistically I should have planned this more in advance, there was really never very much likelihood  of anything concrete being observed given the area covered and the number of eyes on the ground interested and available to the task, but for everyone who did actually stick their necks outside and have a look - I trust you can forgive me putting you out, but the effort on your part - I genuinely can't put a price on. 

To see if there's any quantitative result we'll just have to wait for local reporting to see if anything shows up - if you're interested trot along to the [National UFO Reporting Centre](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlfl.html) \- if anything turns up that'll be the place it will show and, just in case anyone did observe anything, do file a report.  These things help.

Once again, my very best to you all. Thanks for having me. You've been brilliant, thank you.

t3_dy4iof,all_ads,My friend's grandfather and worms?,Thetruthishere,"My best friend texted me yesterday with a seriously odd situation and I wanted to know if any of you have an idea about it. Her grandfather is having a problem with worms in his kitchen. At first I assumed it was from unsanitary conditions, but she went to visit him and gave me a strange story. They went grocery shopping and put up the groceries, walked out of the room, and a few minutes later came in to worms everywhere. He said that this has been happening a lot in the last week or so. They can't find a place they are coming from, and they appear in the hundreds in minutes. Anyone experienced anything like this??"
t3_dy05f4,all_ads,Anybody feel more sensitive to the unknown?,Thetruthishere,"I think this is a good place to share, but do any of you feel like you attract the unknown, I’ve had several experiences, which I’d like to think it was all just one thing, but I feel like I can sense a presence, not 24/7 but randomly I know I have a visitor, but I also brush this up as I’m being paranoid.  
My grandmother says she has this ability to see the transitional phase after death.  She says she knows when there’s hostile spirits in places, and that things communicate with her to the point she gets annoyed.  She lives in Mexico and I lived with her for a year.  I was always scared of things but I can’t remember what it was, my grandmother would take me to this old mans house deep in the jungle (?) from what I remember, it would take a whole day to get there and his house was hidden in the trees, there would be lines of people there to speak to him, well this man would chant things and rub an egg all over and kind of pamper(?) smack me all Over with these really good smelling vines, he’d then ask me to look away and not look at the egg when he cracked it or it would come back, my grandmother said the egg would come out dark brown when I asked about it. She was also instructed to do this a couple times at home but to place the egg under my bed where I slept and to throw it out in the mornings.  My grandmother told me about the headless man in a nice white button shirt, she said he would try to get her attention but she’d tell him to go away that he was dead, she said he would dance in the roof throughout the day and before she slept he’d throw himself off the roof and could just hear his body as he landed at night, the last time she saw him was when she opened the fridge, bent over to get something and something kicked the fridge door, she peek up but nothing was there, she finished getting what she wanted and closed the fridge and there was the headless man, she kicked him out of the house, she said you do not belong here, you are dead and you are not welcome here, never saw him again.  She also saw a black dog, with a chicken foot.  She came to visit me back in 2008, when I was suffering from sleep paralysis and she immediately said nop, and got to her ritual, as she was doing her ritual she would burp out the bad,  at least that’s what I understood, she was chanting and these loud beer gulping burps would come out of her.  One last thing, I recall an Native Indian man, I would see him from time to time, not threatening but he was always out of place.  I don’t know more of my family other than my mother and my grandmother, I bought ancestry DNA to find more about myself and results were that I’m 50% Native American not sure if that had anything to do with it though. This stuff is nothing to my grandmother, she assured me she would tickle my feet in my sleep when she passed to say goodbye. (Honestly Im so fucking scared about that, but to her dead and alive are the same)"
t3_dydr46,all_ads,Something may be happening in my house,Thetruthishere,"I feel my house may be haunted

This story has a bit of a backstory:

23 years ago, a woman, her husband and their kids lived in my house. My aunt who lived here at the time (before I was born) was renting the basement out to people.  Now these people were all relatively normal (from what I’ve been told) all except for the husband. The husband was a mean old jerk who my aunt heard on multiple occasions beating his wife in my basement in front of their kids. 

I believe either they moved out eventually or my aunt evicted them I’m not quite sure which it was, but soon after they moved, she died. She was killed by her husband and her body found not 20 minutes from my house. 

About 2 years ago at this point my dad was going into the attic for old Christmas decorations. However when he opened the attic door, something fell on him. Now look, our attic is very cramped and messy, but only one thing fell on him. It was a newspaper, the newspaper where this woman’s death was reported. My dad to this day will tell you when he read that he got goosebumps. Even though he was frightened he brushed it off and put the newspaper back in the attic. 

But he didn’t tell me about this experience till the following Thanksgiving. But when Christmas of 2018 rolled around, I was with my dad when he went up to the attic. Sure enough when he opened that attic door on that day, the first this to come falling out was that newspaper. However along with it were some old art notebooks that my mom believed belonged to my uncle. These art books contained many unsettling and creepy pictures. 

Now I’m very new to this sub and occurrences like this. This whole thing may have been one giant coincidence. But I’m curious.

I’m not sure how to attach images to this post so here’s a link to pictures of the newspaper and art books:"
t3_dy7jcs,all_ads,"The truth of the everything being one, a forgotten way of experiencing yourself.",Thetruthishere,"This simple idea starts from defining who you are. The moment we were born our parents defined us by the skin on the outside. They used their minds to identify something outside themselves because their parents taught them that way. It's honestly a miracle that they were able to define you out of everything in this entire universe. Congratulations on being something other than nothing. We can say it's a miracle if we want to. 

I personally believed that was the only way life was. There was no way to feel anything outside of my body and definitely no way for someone to feel my thoughts or pain. This view is perfectly normal and it is essentially the truth to many people on this planet. Yet, have you ever heard of twins feeling each other's pain? Well, I had a similar story where my heart was full of pain. Only to discovered my relative and closest friend could feel it as well. 

Discovering that is was possible to feel things outside of my body and possible for other people to feel inside mine, my life flipped upside down as if I was a brand new person. Over the past year I discovered things about myself that I had not felt before in my life. It was like I was able to link things happening on the outside world with feelings on the inside of my body. Ranging from a pain to a tingling feeling. It can be in my heart, my mind, and even my limbs. 

This whole new experience was something I was very interested in learning about. As over the course of a year, I had many synchronicity events and coincidences that the chances are astronomical. Certain moments I would find myself in other people's thoughts and emotions. I was lost for awhile due to this and had to find myself again many times. It's a very confusing mindset and takes time to learn from my experience. 

It was like my body connected to a different type of internet. A invisible connection between everything I saw. During a meditation experience under the stars I could see lines of energy connecting everything me and the stars. Everything as you see it has a invisible connection between it. The connection or understanding is that whatever you experience on the outside is happening on the inside. You are the world you're living in. 

Take some time out of your day, see if you can feel something outside of yourself."

My mom and my grandma are both Cancer and both believe that Cancers have ""special abilities"" things that they can't control but just like knowledge of things that they shouldn't know about. There are 2 times that come to mind where I cant explain how they knew things.

1. Recently I got a date with a girl I had been talking to for about a week or so.
I hadn't told my mom that I was even talking to anyone. When I told my mom about my date she replies with ""I know."" When I asked how she just said something about being a cancer.

2. When I was young me and my mom used to watch CSI and Law and Order type shows every day. We were watching an episode of LaO that I hadn't seen before and thought to my self ""oh I haven't seen this episode"" and as if I was talking directly to her my mom says ""niether have I"". I asked her how she know I was thinking that and she just said she didn't know.

So a few years back in 2013, me and my wife watched the film The Conjuring. I was already slightly familiar with Ed and Lorraine Warren but my Mrs wasn’t and I started telling her about how they were involved with a haunted doll. This also lead me to tell her about that other fairly well known haunted toy, Robert the Doll. So I typed into my phone ‘Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren doll’ and then my phone went nuts (see the pic in the link above). Never had anything like that happen before or since. Maybe it was just some random one off weird glitch. Just seems odd that it glitched that one and only time though. Any thoughts?"

t3_dxyhyo,all_ads,Weird sleep paralysis about being inserted a tracking device?,Thetruthishere,"(Sorry about any typos and the form)

I haven't had a sleep paralysis in a while, but now that I got one where the voice was slightly threatening I'm just slightly anxious. If the purpose was to scare me then congratulations it worked. 

What happened was that I get a sleep paralysis and I hear this voice (a male voice?) talking about random things and I'm just like oh okay just some nonsense auditory hallucinations, no big deal since I get them once in a while. But then I hear another male voice that was directed towards me saying things like 'how I'm leaking energy' and 'how nice it is to be behind me? (added a comment about my butt as well which was weird and creepy??) and I told him to leave me alone and he then said that maybe he should put a hearing device/ a wiretap? on me since he has been delaying that already. And that it probably ends up being lethal or something. 
I don't remember the details of what I said and what he said but I did ask him why would he do it now if he has already delayed it for so many times. He only said something like 'why not since you cannot do anything about it'. I remember that I was quiet for a while as a reaction to something he said but then I decided that I'm not okay with this so I started to pray but I couldn't really make actual sentences since he started to yell something on top of my praying (like 'now I insert this thing on you blahblahblah) and after that I woke up all flushed up and shaking with anxiety like damn if someone wanted a reaction they really did push that out of me.
If something was being inserted on me, I have no idea where it would be. Nothing feels different before, during or after this thing. 

I wanted to write this here to have opinions on this. I'm starting to think it was just my brain coming up with weird shit but also it was too detailed and something really out of ordinary. Like how &amp; why would my brain make something like that? It's just odd. 

TL;DR Sleep paralysis- voice said he'll insert a listening device/ a wiretap on me even when it probably ends up being lethal. First auditory hallucination in a while and it's a weird one, nice."
t3_dxy3br,all_ads,Courtney in the Corner,Thetruthishere,"This one is a second hand story from my parents.  I have an older sister, and when she was about 3-7 she would sleepwalk and talk like crazy.  But my parents didn't think anything of it until one night they went into her bedroom, and she was standing facing the corner, talking absolute gibberish.  When they asked who she was talking to, she said no one.  When they asked why she was standing in the corner she claimed she was in bed.  All in a very hollow, creepy voice.  They locked her in her room until sunup.  This happened when we lived with my Grandmother, so I had a lot of weird experiences in that house too.  I think it helped my parents associate this event with something weirder than just sleepwalking/talking since I reported so many ghosts there."

t3_dxho2j,all_ads,Anyone else have a gnome story?,Thetruthishere,"Ok,so here’s my gnome story.. When I was a kid, we would get together with my cousins a few times a year. They would either come stay with us for a few days or we would stay at their house for a few days. My oldest cousin is a year older than me and my other cousin is a year younger. The gnome story took place at their house. I can’t remember exactly how old I was at the time but somewhere between 4-6ish. So me and my older cousin were sleeping in her room when I was awakened by whispering. She had a nightlight next to her dollhouse so I could see a little bit in her room. When I looked around to see where the whispering was coming from, I saw what looked like gnomes.  I was absolutely terrified and woke my cousin up to tell her. She told me to just ignore them and not even look at them and then she went back to sleep. I was scared out of my mind and hid under the blanket until the sun came up. I asked her about them again the next day. She told me that she only sees them once in awhile but my other cousin saw them frequently. Weirdly, I don’t think we ever really talked about them again but I definitely remember after that being afraid at their house at night. I absolutely would not use the bathroom during the night there because I was so afraid of seeing them again. I know most people aren’t going to believe this story and that’s ok, I wouldn’t have believed it myself had I not seen them. Believe me or not,but I definitely know what I saw."

t3_dxuphw,all_ads,It preys on your misfortune,Thetruthishere,"I know it's been a long while since I last posted here but I'm back with something else that's terrorizing me.

It all started at the very beginning of this month. For some reason everything felt off, like something changed but you don't know what. I didn't pay any mind to it and just went about my way. 

This month turned out to be a pretty bad month for as I kept breaking things around my house and kept injuring myself in random ways. The feeling that something was off never went away during all this time but I kept pushing that feeling away. 

I've been having so many nightmares about things I can't even remember and I can't seem to fall asleep until like 3 am. The more I kept injuring myself and breaking things the more I got depressed, and that leads me to where we are now.

So right after I fell asleep last night I had the worst and most vivid dream that I've ever had and I can even remember what it was about. 

I was dreaming about that I finally had enough and was planning to end my life. I had a suicide note written and was walking out of my house while while I could hear my mom read the note and crying.  It played out like a cheesy movie, the song ""The End Of Evangelion"" was playing in the background while I was walking to the rooftop of a building. 

As I got to the edge of the rooftop I was sitting there with a gun to my head deciding if I should blow my brains out of fall off the building. This was the happiest and saddest I've ever felt at the same time. I chose to do both by jumping and try to end it with my eyes closed.

That's when I woke up from my dream. My heart was beating fast and i had tears in my eyes. I just layed in bed to calm down and wiped the tears from my eyes.

While I was laying down listening to my heartbeat
I thought about why was I able to hear it in my ear. That's when I realized that it went like I was hearing someone's heartbeat was matching mine. I started hearing voices whispering things in my ear that was against my pillow.

That's when I saw it, out of the corner of my eye there was these shadowy fingers that tried to escape from under me. As soon as I noticed the fingers it disappeared alongside the whispering."

Am I just crazy or does this look like it was pushed with actual force? I think I see something (invisible almost ahha but seriously like some movement to the left of the tree right before it fell). I was pissed cause I worked so hard on it.

t3_dxi82b,all_ads,Is my house weird or am I just stressed out?,Thetruthishere,"I bought my house with my fiance in April, and for a few months I've been having similar dreams that I've never had before. But it doesn't feel like a dream; it feels like something is pulling me slowly out of sleep, into a semi-awake state, then the ""dream"" happens.

What usually happens is: I'll slowly come out of sleep, half-awake, and I'll hear the night security alarm be triggered, hear my dog barking like crazy, and hear an ""intruder's"" footsteps outside, walking towards our bedroom (the door is closed). Then I'll instantly wake up - the alarm isn't really ringing, my dog is asleep - but my heart will be pounding right out of my chest and I'll wake up with feelings of panic and dread, it's happened maybe 4-5 times at least. Or, I'll wake up to a half-awake state, and hear knocks on my bedroom window, then I'll wake up for real and it feels like I only heard those knocks in my head. Yesterday, I half-woke up and heard footsteps in the hallway, walking toward my bedroom door, and I heard / saw the doorknob turning, and I heard my fiance wake up and feel afraid for who was out there. Then I woke up, there was no noise outside, and my fiance was asleep. 

I'm thinking I'm just stressed. But random weird stuff has also happened like: we were in the bedroom one day and heard a loud-ass crash, we thought a cat jumped on the bookshelf and the whole thing toppled over. We immediately went to check, but nothing was out of place, and to this day we don't know what it was. One morning at 5am, we woke up to what we thought was the night security alarm triggered, but we realized it wasn't the same sound at all, it was more of a half siren/half sing-song thing, but it was loud as hell and really scary. After a minute, it stopped. We thought it was the smoke alarm, but didn't find anything out of the ordinary. We thought it was carbon monoxide, but turns out our alarm is only for smoke? 

I don't know, I don't think anything is wrong with the house, but the half-dreams about the intruder alarm is really weird to me. I haven't had those dreams before, and waking up with my heart pounding out of my chest is something that's not happened before either."
t3_dx52da,all_ads,The dream that made me stop dreaming,Thetruthishere,"

I'm not superstitious, not religious or spiritual, and I don't really believe in ghosts or the much but there is one thing that happened to me a few years ago that I still get creeped out about. For background, I used to be an avid lucid dreamer. I'd have lucid dreams whenever I could, kept a dream journal, all that good shit. I was abused by my 3rd grade teacher and as a result I have had nightmares every night for the last 20 years, and being able to control the dream to switch it to something nice was a vast quality of life improvement for me, especially because I get about double the amount of REM sleep as the average person. This dream I had actually made me stop lucid dreaming entirely. 

I also want to clarify that I spend a lot of time learning about dreams and what happens when we sleep, like how the part of our brains that control logic is low-activity during normal dreams and that's why your dreams are weird, and waking this part up is crucial to having lucidity in dreams. My point is, I don't consider dreams mystical or anything. I see them as any other body function. 

I also want to state that I do sometimes experience sleep paralysis, and although terrifying in the moment, I don't find any spookiness in it because I know the scary shit I see when it happens isn't real. I don't find scary dreams scary after I wake up. I know they are just dreams. This one has always given me a ""more-than-dream"" vibe, which is why it is so unsettling for me. It's the only dream I've ever had that gives me the feeling. 

Before you read the dream, I hope you don't find it a let-down. There are no jump scares or spooky screams or demon writing in blood on the walls. It might even seem mundane.

So, the dream. It takes place in a location I saw in many of my dreams. It's a back road in the woods, the kind where the tire tracks make two lines in the grass. It's always fall here, the trees are always golden and leaf litter is plentiful. There's a house here that lines up with the road, it's like a semi-nice mix between a mobile home and a plantation style house. It's off-white, single story, not very big, and all the windows have opaque white curtains drawn so you can't see inside. I always knock on the door and never get an answer. Sometimes I try to open it. 

This is a good time to note that these dreams were semi-lucid. I have some control, but I am not fully aware I am dreaming. 

The door is always locked. I find the forest relaxing though and I go to this place because I can find interesting items, mostly animal bones, wasp nests, shed snake skins, gemstones or cool rocks. All things I liked to collect in real life as I found them beautiful ( I promise I'm not edgy or a witch, I also like and collect flowers, tiny cactus, handmade plant pots and my day job is making soft beds for small animals like guinea pigs and ferrets) 

So one night, I return back to this location. I knocked on the door, and got no reply. I start walking around in front of the house collecting things into a little basket. I do this for maybe a few minutes, and then the door opens. First time this has ever happened. A big, tall guy comes out, hes wearing an apron, it's clean and white. He doesn't have a shirt on, but he is wearing pants. He DOES have a face, but I literally cannot understand it. I look at it and think it's weird, but I can't even begin to try and explain his face to you. It's not deformed, but it is..distorted? Like my eyes don't work right when I look at his face.

 He asks me what I'm doing in front of his house, so I show him my basket of things. He tells me he has a bunch of really rare/cool animal bones inside his house if I want to come inside and take any. He doesn't give me any bad vibes. He seems really nice actually, and I say okay and start walking with him to go inside the house. 

My ""mom"" shows up at this point in a car. It's worth noting that my mom in my dreams always looks like my mom, but is not her, and I am aware of this in the dream. It's always the same type of personality, so I think I have built her in my brain and she just shows up in dreams in the body/face most familiar to me, my mom. She only shows up in nightmares and saves me or calms me down. She is not sweet/caring, more like it's just her job to do those things. 

Anyway she shows up in the car and tells me to get in and that we need to leave right now. I don't want to leave because it feels REALLY rude to the house-man. Like I really, really feel bad for trying to leave after he was so nice to me. At first he tells me it's okay to go, so I start getting in the car. Then his demeanor completely changes, and he's begging me not to leave. He gets more aggressive as it becomes clearer I am not going to change my mind and stay. He then tries grabbing me through the window to pull me out of the car, but my mom pushes him off and starts to drive away. He tries to follow the car but eventually we drive into nothing. The whole dream just becomes black, like the only thing that exists is the car and the things inside it.

Anyway, pretty sure the guy that came out of the house was a demon or some shit.

I don't lucid dream anymore, because the lingering feelings from the dream are very unsettling and give me anxiety, and I know my lucid self would default to going to that location after I lose lucidity and I'd rather have the nightmares than risk going back to that place. I now take a drug called topiramate to control my nightmares instead. I still dream and have nightmares, but they are less intense and no longer wake me up most of the time. 

Sorry this was super long, I tried to condense it down for easier reading, but if you have questions i'll do my best to answer. This dream was several years ago though, and despite having excellent dream recall, there's probably some details I simply don't remember. 

TL;DR Almost traded my soul to a demon for some bones in a dream"
t3_dxct3l,all_ads,Mars,Thetruthishere,"I saw that they found mass evidence of a once ocean or evidence of a large body of water on Mars today and it got me thinking, what if the first ever ""humans"" lived on Mars and the planet got destroyed by either normal destruction or something happen where it was uninhabitable by humans anymore that they left and found Earth, and once Earth becomes just like Mars; uninhabitable that we or whatever ""we"" evolve into thousands of years later will find somewhere else to habit leaving Earth just like Mars, thoughts?"
t3_dxajn3,all_ads,An Encounter With 3 Shadows,Thetruthishere,"I have been able to see shadow people ever since I was a child. Usually, the shadows are benevolent and sometimes they even help me avoid dangers or guide me in certain decisions.

I usually see two different shadow people. One is a tall standing male who stands stiff as a board. The other is a long lanky individual that I see crawl on the ground and on the walls. Strangely, I’m not scared of them; I’m more cautious of their presence as if they were wild animals.

On this fateful day I was sleeping in my bed when I decided to get up and get a drink. I laid back down in bed after groggily getting my drink. After lying there for a few minutes I opened my eyes in frustration because I couldn’t sleep. Once I did I saw something standing near the edge of the bed. I thought it was my girlfriend and sat up,opening my arms for her to climb in bed. Suddenly my grogginess turned to an alertness as I realized my girlfriend would not be home tonight. As soon as this realization hit me the shadow lunged toward me. Two things happened simultaneously. First, I felt a very soft cold air materialize around my left shoulder. Almost as soon as I felt it, it hardened into something that felt like a block around my shoulder. It pulled me back away from the shadow lunging at me. Second, the shadow that I usually see crawling around darted off the wall behind me and smashed into the one lunging at me. I watched the two sort of combine and disappear in a smoke-like mist. With my adrenaline rushing, I turned around to see the tall shadow blend into the wall and also disappear. I got up and turned on the lights to just get rid of all the shadows. 

I tried to write it off as sleep paralysis but I felt fully alert and was able to move my body. There was no “waking up” feeling like one would get from a dream. I haven’t seen either of the two shadows or the malevolent shadow since the incident. I just had to write this down so I don’t begin creating false memories of the event."
t3_dx6l8h,all_ads,The orb,Thetruthishere,"I lived in the suburbs of a small town in Italy till i was 19, near my house there is a dirt road that leads to a small wood, I went to the wood with my friends a lot of times when i was a kid, to play/explore the wood and stuffs like that.

Before entering the wood on the side of the dirt road there is an unfinished house and going forward there's a country house built far from the road accessible via a small path.
You can see the two buildings here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/6AinNn9UdTiZmLXZ7

I first saw the orb when i was 12/13 yo and i was going to the wood on bicycles with my friends, we decided to stop and explore the unfinished house on the side of the road, so we went inside but there was nothing interesting, just an empty house and we decided to leave, before going out of the house i noticed some stairs that were leading to the first floor, my friends were already on the road ready to go except for one of them that was still in the house with me, i asked him to wait for me as i was going upstairs to see what was there, i was a little scared because the first floor was dark but I decided to go there anyway, i took two steps and i saw something on the last step, it was a new bouquet, it looked like someone bought it the same day and decided to dump it there, at that point I was very scared and unsure to move forward, i took 2-3 more steps and I was able to see a room on the right, inside the room there was the orb, a small white orb with a light inside floating but it wasn't a normal led light, that light wasn't propagating, it wasn't enlightening anything, it was contained in this small orb that wasn't moving at all.
I ran downstairs and outside as soon as i saw it and never talked about it to my friends fearing that they could've make fun of me.
Time passed and i forgot about that event.

When i was 15 i started smoking weed so I usually went to the wood alone to smoke in peace, nothing ever happened in the wood so it didn't scare me, even though the house did, so every time i went to the wood I ran when i was passing by the house and then forget about it.
But someday i decided to explore the country house, I was high and taking everything very lightly, so I went into the house from the front door, it was another empty house, the windows were open so it wasn't even dark, but one room wasn't like the others, it's the room with the big door that you can see on the side of the country house, the floor and the walls in that room were burned and totally black, there was a gas tank on the floor with some gasoline still inside, and on one wall there was a small opening leading to a very little and totally dark room, like 5x1.5 meters, this little room was also burned and on the ground there were a pair of children's shoes, suddenly the fear comes in but it was nothing compared to the one i felt when i looked outside, in the middle of the countryside beetween the country house and the abandoned one, there was the same orb that i saw years before.
I've never ran faster like i did then in my life.

Until a year ago, when i was 18.

I was hanging out a summer night with two friends of mine, we were bored so we decided to go into the wood that night, I started to be very scared and my friends started making fun of me, but i wasn't scared of the darkness, i was scared of the orb.
We parked the car at the end of the paved road and decided to walk the rest of the way, we pass by the abandoned house and it was there, it was the orb standing in the middle of the countryside, it was the first time i saw it at night and it was different because it wasn't just a circular light, behind the light there was the silhouette of a child. I couldn't see the face or the rest of the body, just a white, thin silhouette.
And this time my friends saw it too because they started to run and so did I.

I don't live there anymore, got an high school degree and went to university in a big city but if i was there i would've take pics to show you the house, the burned room, the shoes and everything, if anyone lives near there and wants to go and check you will see exactly what i described.

I've had trouble sleeping since then and that orb haunts my dreams and my life.

English is not my native language so i apologize for potential errors i made."

t3_dwv5fd,all_ads,The Strangest Night that I Cannot Explain. It Haunts Me to This Day.,Thetruthishere,"I’ll try to keep this short.

I used to live in a very rural area in Georgia, north of Columbus. My nearest neighbor was about 5 miles away. Today it’s full of subdivisions and HOAs, but back then it was desolate. 

I often traveled in to Columbus as I had friends there. We’d often hang out by the Chattahoochee River. One night I happened to go to the Riverwalk by the river alone.  As I got out of my car I immediately got a whiff of something rank - it smelled like sulfur and bog water. And then a sense of dread overtook me. I went into a full blown panic attack that thankfully only lasted a couple of minutes.  At the time I was dealing with a lot of abuse I experienced as a child and going to therapy, so I wasn’t completely taken by surprise.

Anyway, the feeling of dread passed, and I went down by the river and took a walk for a couple of miles.  I approached a bridge that was completely dark. There was a single street light at the end of the bridge, so you couldn’t really see anything on the bridge that well. However, I did see one figure on the bridge - this incredibly tall man, who had to be over 6 ft. 6.  He wore a large cowboy hat and I could tell he was looking right at me.  And then I heard a splash.  A big splash. Something relatively large hit the water. 

I freaked out and decided to call it a night. I get back to my car about half an hour later and I notice police cars and a fire truck passing in the distance. As I get in my car I notice what appears to be the SAME man at a phone booth, about 100 feet away. He’s looking at me.  I can make out more details of him now.  He had a jet black, well-maintained beard and looked to be in his 40s. To be honest I felt strangely attracted to him yet I dated not get any closer. 

I begin driving home and as I pass the county line in which my home resides, I almost swerve  because I see a huge cowboy hat in the middle of the road.

And then I finally pulled into my driveway and saw the most horrific thing.  My headlights shone on a dead turkey. But it wasn’t just a dead turkey.  This thing was eviscerated. Its throat was slashed and its innards we’re arranged around it in a perfect circle. Yet there was little or no blood.  I kind of just stopped there and had no idea how to proceed, but eventually I work up the courage to drive around the turkey murder crime scene and pull up the the house.  It was then I discovered where the blood went.  It covered my front door.

I called the police, and it took them a good hour to get there, which irked me, but as I was talking to the officer who arrived, he said half the force was handling a suicide that occurred at the Riverwalk.  At the bridge where I heard the splash.

I’ve tried to explain the turkey as some prank, but combined with the suicide and the guy in the cowboy hat, I just can’t find any explanation. Given the holidays coming up, I always remember this unnerving night."
t3_dwwhvn,all_ads,Color people,Thetruthishere,"When I was really young I used to see what I called ""colored people"". They were covered from head to toe in blue, red, and yellow. It looked like paint but psychedelic, all sloppily mixed and it coated them completely. They had no hair or features. It was a normal occurance when I was small. I would randomly see them through my peripherals, and they seemed to float out of my vision. The last time I saw them was when I was 8. I was in the den watching TV one afternoon, alone, and to my left I saw a group of them (maybe 3 or 4) float and melt into the wall across the room. If I ever looked directly at them they would disappear. That was the first time I really gave it thought and was curious about what I was seeing. I remember thinking that the next time it happened I would be more conscious of it but I never saw them again. I had mentioned it to grownups but no one paid much attention to what I said as a kid."
t3_dwxjl8,all_ads,Can people sense what is not there?,Thetruthishere,"A couple of years ago, I’m 19 as of now, I moved into this house. The house wasn’t old or “spooky” but it gave me “bad vibes” like I could sense something else was in that house. 

It all started when we moved in. My family went out to get food and I decided to stay home and unpack. While I was unpacking I heard a loud bang downstairs, the house was a split foyer, so I go to check it out. I noticed that something had fallen off the washer, I knew it couldn’t have fallen off by itself because I recalled it being in the center of the machine, with the machine off, instead of being on the edge; no animals were in the house. It got me thinking but I brushed it off. 

After we all settled in I had a corner of my room full of icons of the Saints and Christ, I’m Orthodox, and at night that corner always gave me bad vibes. I would never stare at it too long or I would get freaked out. I always thought out of every corner in my room that gave me the chills to look at it, you would think the opposite effect but no. 

Fast forward a year, I eventually moved down into the finished basement with its own bath. Once I moved down there that’s when the dreams occurred. It seemed almost every night I would have a dream with something to do with demonic activity. I even had a series of dreams that almost played like a movie about a hidden room in our house that I found that would make me physically scared to get near. The dreams weren’t all as soon as I moved down there. I would notice that things would be replaced with other like objects or slightly moved. Across my room, under the stairs, was a storage area with a door. I would always get the chills walking by the door or look over my shoulder. To me that space under the stairs seemed like a “hotspot” of activity. 

Everything eventually stopped after one dream I had. The dream was I eventually entered that hidden room, and with the help of my priest who was in the dream, we said like a prayer and walked through the room blessing it. I still have what se said word for word written down if you want to read it. After that night I no longer got any weird feelings and stuff seemed to stop. 

I don’t know if this was just a very active imagination on my part or something unexplainable. Sorry for it being so long and if you do find typos I typed this on my phone. I no longer get weird feelings like back then. If you have any comments or questions I would love to hear them."

t3_dwlqhw,all_ads,My Drunk Brother Saw a Leprechaun in Scotland...but Probably Not,Thetruthishere,"Hi all, I debated sharing this because, to be honest, I don't believe it was a real experience. That said, I think some of you would enjoy the story because it's funny. And who knows, maybe my brother did tap into the other side!

In the Summer of 2014 I studied abroad in Ireland studying archaeology. As someone who has always been open to the paranormal, deep down I was hoping to see a faerie or something. For me, nothing came. I did have an uneasy feeling of being watched in the field, at times, but that's it. My older brother, however, would have quite a memorable experience on that trip - but in Scotland.

My older brothers came to Ireland as I finished my studies and we took a brotherly trip across Ireland, then traveled to the U.K. We drove across Wales and Northern England and concluded our trip in Scotland. This is where the leprechaun showed up... or more likely my brother mixed the wrong things.

My older brother has terrible bouts of insomnia, which here in the States he treats with diphenhydramine, which is over the counter. We were unaware that it wasn't the same in the U.K. and he wound up trying to make due with valerian, which never worked for him. On our last night, I figured I'd stay up with him and I'd sleep on the plane. We sat in the hotel bar until a group of locals from a wedding party in the hotel ballroom chatted us up. They were drunk, and as it was our last night, they kept buying us drinks. Now I don't drink, so my older bro was doubling up on drinks and very quickly was completely hammered. I walked him out of the bar and set him on a sofa in a lounge area near the elevators to the hotel rooms. After about 20 minutes he sat up and needed to go to the restroom, so I shouldered him along. That, ladies and gentlemen, is where he saw the leprechaun.

I put my bro in a stall and stood by the sinks, trying not to be a creeper. A few gents from the wedding party came and went and my bro was still in the stall. Thinking he passed out, I called to him and he responded. A few seconds later he came out of the stall and immediately ran to the adjoining stall and kicked it open. ""What the hell?"" I said, and he drunkenly belted out ""Where'd that midget go!?"" I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, and I just kind of laughed at him (also there was a random dude from the wedding party at a urinal when he did this).

I walked my brother out of the bathroom and into a hallway, at one end was the lounge with elevators and at the other was the ballroom with the wedding party. My brother was LOUDLY demanding I tell him if I saw ""it."" I asked him what he was talking about and this is what he explained to me.

He told me that when he was in the stall, an adult sized shoe came under the stall wall. My brother then saw a creature peak under the stall. He described this creature as being the size of a dwarf but with average adult sized feet. The creature had a worn, leathery face with eyes like lumps of black coal. My brother also said the bring was wearing wingtip shoes and a creme colored ""Saturday Night Fever"" suit.

My brother was adamant that he had seen this thing and that it was ""evil."" Angry that I hadn't seen it, the drunken fool became hysterical and starting to basically yell that ""It's gonna kill! It's gonna rape and kill!"" 

I was desperately trying to get him to the couch in the lounge, but he became more agitated and finally broke from me. The crazy bastard wrenched a fire extinguisher from the wall in the hallway, and proceeded TOWARD THE BALLROOM FULL OF WEDDING GUESTS. Since he was so drunk, he fumbled with the key so I was able to take it away from him. Again I asked him what the hell he was doing and he said ""I'm gonna freeze him! He's gonna rape and kill."" Angrily, I said something about the fire extinguisher being chemical powder and not CO2 and my brother just said ""I'm gonna chemical freeze him!"" (I include this, as its now a running joke between us).

Thankfully, three guys from the wedding party came down the hall and gave me a hand getting my brother to the lounge. Meanwhile, he's still babbling about the ""midget"" that's going to ""rape and kill."" They paid him little mind, and I thanked them for their help. My brother passed out on the lounge couch for about 3 hours before I woke him to go up to our hotel room, where my other brother had been asleep through this whole ordeal.


I'm pretty certain this was the result of mixing too much valerian with alcohol, but who knows? Maybe he made a psychic connection with something in his drunken state.

In any case, I hope you got a few chuckles out of this story. I still laugh about it myself, from time to time. I just thank God I was able to get the fire extinguisher away from him before he barged into that wedding reception raving about freezing a ""raping midget."""
t3_dwdke1,all_ads,Dandelion Fairies?,Thetruthishere,"So, when I was little, I always had trouble going to sleep.  I would just look around my room in the dark.  I can’t remember if I had a night light or not, but my door would be shut, and I recall seeing light from the hallway underneath the door and at the top.  It was a fairly normal occurrence that I would sometimes see these ‘things’ floating all around me.  Then best I can describe them was that they resembled dandelion seeds when you blow them into the air, except them came down in a steady, uniform pattern.  I don’t think I ever told anyone.  They never frightened me, and as I got older and thought about them, I wondered if they were just my eyes doing weird things (I am very far-sighted).  One year as an adult, I told the story to my family at Thanksgiving, and my brother was shocked and said, “You saw those, too?!”  I’ve always wondered if it was an eye trick or something more.  Does anyone have any insight?  Thank you!"
t3_dwj1sk,all_ads,He visited me,Thetruthishere,"For starters, I don’t want to reveal too much information about this young man out of respect for him and his family. For the sake of this post, I will call him Alex. I would just like to share my experience with what I hope was Alex.

I can’t remember the exact year this happened, but I believe it happened in 2013. My husband’s (at the time, boyfriend) former classmate from middle school unfortunately killed himself. Prior to Alex’s death, I did not know him personally, I just knew of him and have heard stories about him. I think I’ve only seen him about once or twice before his death. The night Alex passed away, I laid on my bed which was in the far corner of my room next to a window. There was a streetlight close to my window which let in a lot of light in the room. Before falling asleep, I began to pray and asked God to not send Alex to hell for what he had done. I grew up in a Catholic household and suicide is obviously a huge sin. I asked God to show him mercy and to give him another chance. I then drifted into a deep sleep, deeper than usual. I woke up a few hours later, but I didn’t open my eyes yet. I felt a soft touch, kind of like a soft poke on my thigh and I opened my eyes. In the corner of the room, where the window was, I saw a dark figure standing next to the window. I thought it was my eyes or mind playing tricks on me, but I noticed there was no light shining through the window. It did not give off a threatening or evil vibe, but I could feel that it wanted to make its presence known. I stared at the figure for a few seconds before I fell back asleep. After that, I never gave it much thought until recently. I hope it was Alex who visited me, letting me know that he was going to be okay or thanking me for praying for him. I think about him almost daily now and still pray for him. I hope he is okay and finally at peace."

t3_dw9moy,all_ads,Strange footprints,Thetruthishere,"I have like 10 strange personal experiences but this one is about my brother’s experience about 12 years ago when I was 10 years old.

I’ve posted this in another related community and I thought I should post it here just to confirm that there are really things out there that we are not completely aware of.

This happened to my brother  when he was camping with my cousin in Iran’s Mazandaran jungles let me mention it here in these jungles the only dangerous wild animals are only bears, there are some other wild cats and leopards but they are rare and almost extinct and other animals are just wild boars ...
and Iran has no monkeys or gorillas so they headed to a jungle park resort, they decided to camp outside of the park’s designated safe zone.

At night when he was sleeping in their tent my brother heard some noises outside but he ignored it, the next day in the morning when they woke up, they found a big human foot print except it had 3 sharp toes.

The locals told them that it might have been a jinn, He took a photo and showed it to us when he returned the shape of the foot was exactly like human but except for the toes, the toes were almost human but a little sharper.

Unfortunately my brother never knew the importance of social medias then and government always ignores if anything like this happens so after a few months he deleted the photo and I was only a kid.

I remember I was scared of camping in that park for years during family trips but I always wish that he had kept the photo"
t3_dw50s2,all_ads,It won’t leave me alone...,Thetruthishere,"First post. Have to get this out there...

Let me preface this by saying I have memories of a “shadow person” for as long as I can remember. My first memory is of this thing, this black shadow, hovering over my crib. Constantly. It would dart away anytime someone came into the room.

As a child I had night terrors until about 12 years old. Babysitters were cool until they saw an episode... they didn’t come back after. I would sit up straight in bed, eyes open, screaming at the top of my lungs, but I was asleep. And consciously aware that I had no control over my body. The only way my parents could get me out of it was to put me on the toilet and throw a bucket of water over me. The toilet was necessary because I’d piss myself as soon as I came to.

Sleep paralysis they said...

Night terrors they said...

Years went by before this thing came back to torment me. In college I dated and lived with a dj who was always out till early morning. I spent a lot of time alone. It was a very dark time in my life. Something started calling my name during the day, and whispering in my ear at night. Not often, I ignored it.

Months went by. Guests that slept in the living room would say they saw a shadow going up and down the stairs in the middle of the night, but couldn’t tell if they were dreaming. I’d seen the same thing. At that point I knew it was real, but still wasn’t ready to admit it.

One night I was fighting with my bf on the phone bad. Very late night. I was so angry I was seeing red. That’s when the whispers started. A chorus of them. Like the noise your breath makes when you try to fog glass... “haahhhhhh”.... 

Then the dread set in. I felt a heavy, dark presence in my room moving around my bed. Normally this is also something I would’ve disregarded, but my cat had stood up, back curled, growling and hissing at this thing I couldn’t see. Where I felt it was moving, the cats eyes were following. That’s when it hit me - all those times I shook it off were REAL. It was undeniable.

Panic set in. I looked up and this thing was standing at the foot of my bed. It was tall, masculine but not human. I could only see it’s outline, with the exception of its closed smile, and very long fingers which were touching at the tips.

At that point it was also undeniable that this was not my first encounter with this thing. It was all too familiar. All these repressed childhood memories came flying back with a vengeance.

I threw the covers over my head like a toddler and counted to I don’t even know. The whispers were still going, I knew it was still there, but eventually I had to come out from under the blankets... and when I did it was still standing there. Smiling at me.

I panicked “ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?!”

This things smile went from closed to open. It’s mouth stretched from ear to ear. The only way I can explain it is a Cheshire Cat smile. And it’s long Dracula fingertips started drumming together... it was getting off on my terror.

I called my bf back hysterical, scared to move. He had me put him on speaker so he could say some prayer... at which point the “hahhhhhhh” breaths turned into angry growls.

I ran out of that apartment barefoot in my pajamas, down the streets of Boston, and sat in my car until my bf got home at 5am. I still feel bad about leaving the cat.

Never wanted to be alone in that space again after that. Never got any answers, but I was shook. Still am 10 years later. Shortly thereafter I got a DUI in my driveway after hanging out at college parties on campus trying to avoid being home alone.

Embraced hippy dippy shit after that. It was the only thing I felt I could do to to avoid ever seeing that thing again. Yoga, practicing emotional intelligence to keep my negative emotions quiet, Sage, crystals, ancient symbols, house plants, Himalayan salt, you name it.

3 weeks ago I went to show my new bf a picture of my best friends mother who was murdered in high school. It was the memorial newspaper clipping that I’ve had nestled in the corner of my dresser mirror for 16 years. The picture was gone. I frantically searched the dresser to no avail and cried when I thought I lost it.

Last week I came home from work and the picture was face up on the floor smack dab in the middle of the room.

Yesterday my bf and I woke up in the morning and the full length wall mirror that sits across the room from the dresser mirror was on the floor. This is a heavy ass mirror. It didn’t break, nor did it wake either of us up when it fell? We are both light sleepers.

I went downstairs to make coffee before work when my roommates asked me what the earthquake was about in my room at 2:30am. Apparently the mirror woke them both up when it fell. But not us?

I’m scared. I’m terrified. Where the hell were we that we didn’t we wake up? Why did this conveniently happen at witching hour? Why didn’t the mirror break? Why did my guardian angels picture go missing and show up just last week?

I hung the mirror back up last night and already regretting it. It’s covered in a blanket right now because I’m scared. I’m reading 2 mirrors across from each other can create a portal more powerful than one alone would?

And one alone can. A friend of mine moved into a new house as a kid and started sleepwalking... going through the kitchen knife drawers and threatening family while he was asleep. His mother had someone come in to look at the home and this woman said the mirror behind his bed was the culprit. His mom got rid of the mirror and the sleepwalking stopped.

I feel like something is not happy that I am happy. And I feel like Linda is trying to protect me? Tell me something? Idk. Is something bad about to happen again? Is this dark entity switching up on me using mirrors to get into my space since it can’t get in how it used to? Is it even the same entity?

I’m sorry but when mirrors start flying off the walls in the middle of the night that’s not sleep paralysis. Fuck your medical explanations.

Why? Why me? Wtf did I do in a past life to deserve this? I must’ve been a real shitbag. I’ve done everything I can to protect myself from this evil shit and it keeps coming back. What else can I do?

Could this have anything to do with mercury being in retrograde?

Send good vibes guys... I need all that I can get."

First time I have dreamed something very life like it was at the time I was 6  it was an interesting experience it was so fuckin' real It happened at a abandoned place I was with a guy and 2 girls we were drinking and having lots of fun the thing is I was in a body I couldn't recognize it was much bigger than mine ""my 6 yrs old self was thinking to himself"" unrecognizable people but yet so familiar and the feeling of a bond was there like I knew them but the thing is me as a little kid was so weirded out why did I dreamed about unknown people at that time when I dreamt on a daily basis about naruto and kids stuff.....ok nevermind that was the first.

Fast forward 11 yrs. 

I met new people I got in a ""gang"" so to speak and met lots of ppl girls guys you name it!

Thing is after one month or so I had the same experience that I dreamed 11 yrs ago it.....was....THE ... same fucking experience.

Abandoned place drinking with 3 ppl 2 female one male and interestingly they were my best friends from that group the feeling of dejavu it gave me was so intense it gave me anxious panic attack I don't know how to explain it but simply put the existential dread was so high I was contemplating suicide Idk know why(sorry if it sound a bit off) but I was so drunk I couldn't handle that feeling of dread and somewhat the feeling of that my life is just a simple replay and doesen't matter.

All things good I went past that feeling of dread.

Fast forward 3-4 months again I had dream of me and that said ""gang"" that we go to a funeral again the same weirded out feeling ""wtf"" is happening why we are here why we are in black why we wear black clothes flowers and funeral wreaths.

After I dreamt about those happenigs 2 of my dear friends contemplated suicide.

They did it.....they killed themselves.

I will post a continuation after questions and ideas will be posted.

The main thing is.

WHY?"
t3_dw5mki,all_ads,Anyone else have any experiences with cryptids or paranormal creatures?,Thetruthishere,"Hi, so as for my experience In an apartment I share with multiple other men I awoke one night to sounds in my room. It was the middle of the night and almost completely pitch black in my room aside from a streetlight showing through the big window right next to my bed giving me some visibility. About 3 feet from my bed I had a box of pizza crust and chicken bones i didnt finish from that night laying next to the trash bin. The sounds were rustling and sounded like paper moving so i sat up in bed and looked around. I then saw the cardboard box moving a little bit and thought oh damn did a rat get in here somehow? So i started to get up and yelled HEY when from out the box instead of a rat I see a tiny black skinned man very athletic physique and long nose with medium cut dark hair about the size of a glass cup jump out and dash across my floor it ran straight to my closet opened the door and disappeared. I just sat in my bed saying WTF WTF WTF for like 15 minutes before i called my mom (She's an Old Russian Witch and has raised me and my siblings on the paranormal and tales of creatures being real our whole lives) Her response was during the winter the veil between the normal world and the spirit realm is at its thinnest because the long dark hours and full power of the moon. She told me it was more than likely a Gremlin or a Goblin that came out just to get some free snacks I was still scared shitless.. Also have a few other sightings from family and myself i can explain but I also want to hear your guys!"
t3_dvkaqh,all_ads,A strange lake,Thetruthishere,"(https://imgur.com/voCf1XO a drawing I did of the lake)

This happened this summer in northern Ontario (Canada), near the town of Parry Sound . Me and My friend had headed up north to spend some time up at my Grandads cabin, he shares with a few other hunters and was next to a very long lake (you need to take a boat to get to the cabin). I had gone up there a few weeks prior just to wander around and help my dad with some repairs/improvements he was making to the cabin. While I was their, I looked on a print out of a satellite map they had in the camp of the area( There was no wifi in the cabin, and the it was sort of in a valley, and it was very hard to get any sort of signal) and I noticed that there was a small lake north of the one we were at, and there was a small island inside of the lake. Me and my dad took the boat to the area and found a nice pristine little island ( we didn't go on it, only looked at it), and a nice lake with some swampy areas, and a small fiberglass boat the hunters used to hunt ducks in the lake sometimes near to the right of where we were. The lake was much higher than the one we came from, and it would've been impossible for us to take the boat we came in up the hill to the lake. Me and my friend headed back to explore the island.

We headed up the hill, and noticed there was a small gorge that lead into the lake, it used to be a river but was blocked up by a beaver dam. Me and my friend started to walk through it, and i started to feel uneasy simply because of the increase of bugs in the gorge, and being slightly afraid of running into a beaver pissed off due to us being close to its home. Turns out too my friend was feeling the same feeling, but he couldn't figure out why, he just felt that there was something weird about the lake. We left the gorge and made our way up to the top of the hill where the lake greeted us. We overturned the boat, and after a few failed attempts of trying to launch the boat, we made it to the lake. Now i must say that I am almost 6’4 and my friend is around 5’7, so trying to fit us in the tiny boat, plus our bags made it a bit challenging, along with their being only one oar( we planned on bringing two, but thought one would have been good enough). We made our way to the middle of the lake, aiming for the island, with my friend rowing the boat ( he had more experience rowing with one oar than I did). We both were feeling uneasy but i just put mine off to one, being in a small boat that could tip over if one of us sneezed, and two, being almost a hour from any town or hospital, so we were both kinda worried about getting hurt/stranded but at this time, we were feeling ok, until the boat stopped moving.

We were in the middle of the lake, with a small swamp in front of  a rock face around 20 ft away from our left, and woods to the right.We could see the water around us moving, the wind creating a slight wave. We carefully looked below us to see if we had hit a sandbar but we didn't see any sand beneath us, only just the dark black waters of the lake. We put the oar in the water and didn't feel any current. We found though that we could move to the left and the right, but just not forward, almost like we had hit an invisible wall in a video game. We both felt the boat start to sink down, almost like it was being sucked into the lake. My friend started to row to the right, and we made our way to the right, then once near the coast, we made it to the island. From far away the island seemed to be nice and pristine, but once we got close, we saw that it seemed desolate. The trees were dead/dying, and the island was covered in stone, pine needles, and dead lichen, with swamp and decay covering the lake. We tied the boat to a sturdy, although dead pine tree, and spent some time on the island, checking it out, and looking for anything of interest. After spending some time on the island, and running out of bug spray we decided to head back to the cabin. My friend took the oar, and started to prod the water around the island to find a good place to portage out of. Around this time both me and him started to feel a grave sense of unease. Personally, it felt like a feeling of pure dread, sorta like the feeling of when you get a test you failed back mixed with every instict in my body saying “Get out of here, your gonna fucking die if you stay”. We heard some commotion in the water, and looked and saw around 10 ft away from us we saw some geese run into the water, and right where they came from, we saw what looked like a black shape scuttle/crawl behind some rocks, kinda like a mix of, i guess the closest thing i can think of would be of in Star Wars when the Jawas go behind the rocks. My friend also said he heard a strange noise but I didn't notice it. We also had noticed too that the lake had gotten awfully still, and that the forest had fallen quiet.We found a good place to portage from and we decided that I would row back. As we headed our way back I looked from where we started from and saw a strange black, stick like figure standing from where we left. At this point I didn't want to point it out, so I just kept rowing. I would row for around 7 minutes, then take a short break. But whenever we would take a break, we could hear the crunching of leaves, and breaking of branches following us in the woods. I hugged the coast as we headed back, even when staying around 12 feet away from the shore, I couldn't see the bottom of the lake. We eventually got back, and put the boat back where we found it. When we tipped it over, we noticed that there were scratchmarks, all over the bottom of the boat, that looked like something had tried to claw it. As we started to leave, we decided to take one last look at the beaver dam, where we soon noticed there was a cave behind the dam. Upon seeing this, we decided to gtfo. We made our way back to the main lake, where we used our walkie talkie to tell my grandad to come and pick us up (he was with some hunting buddies that day) ( on another note i forgot to add, we tried to walkie him on the island, but couldn't get any signal)

As we left I looked back, and saw the figure standing on the island. Later that night too, as me and my friend were at a fire pit next to the cabin, we started to hear strange noises coming from the woods, almost like a person trying to make the hoot sounds of an owl, although this could have just been my grandads hunting buddies in the cabin. But yeah that's the jist of the story. The land itself used to be Ojibwa and I'm just wondering if anyone has any sort of guess as to what me and my friend saw. Just to sum it up i guess

-Boat stopping mysteriously -Sense of Dread -Weird black figures -Weird noises similar to static/scream on island and strange hooting at the cabin"
t3_dvv9xs,all_ads,Nightmares,Thetruthishere,"(Sorry for bad English and format, I’m on mobile and English ain’t my first language) Recently, me and my two younger brothers were having a conversation about nightmares, night terrors, dreams, sleep paralysis, etc when the oldest one brought up that he had frequent night terrors/ sleep paralysis in my grandmas house, and that they were the same repeating type dreams (the type that are usually relatively repetitive apart from a few changes)

He only ever had these dreams when he was sleeping in either one of a specific two rooms in her house, these rooms were next to each other with a large space between them, the nightmares/night terrors would usually be that he would be at my grandmas house, wether it’s a case of him just visiting, or having friends over, or being over at hers for Christmas dinner or something, and most stuff is relatively normal apart from one thing, in the space between the two rooms there is another room. This freaked me out at this point because I also had these exact dreams when I’m in one of these rooms at my grandmas.

My brother continues to talk about how in these dreams, the door to the room is also open and the lights are always off, noises are always coming from the room and if you even glance over it you will see unnerving things, like a twisted face in the window, a pair of eyes in the dark, a tall humanoid being etc and paying any form of attention to the room makes you feel a overwhelming urge to enter the room.

A lot of the time paying anymore than a extremely small amount of attention to this room causes you to force your self in to of the room and it feels like something is pulling you in because whether you are lucid dreaming or aren’t you can’t control it. When you are in the room you can’t leave, the door closes and you can’t move, terrifying imagery surrounds you, whether it’s a living creepy being like a skin walker, to thousand s of small spiders to creepy living teddy bears to gore, all sorts of terrifying and creepy and unnerving things start to appear and some approach you untill either one thing gets you or you wake up naturally (if something gets you you wake up).

When you wake up you usually wake up in cold sweat, or if something got you, you wake up with sleep paralysis and some of the creepy things littered around the room. This really creeped me out when my brother said this because I have the exact same experiences and I told him. He told me that he always feels uneasy when he is in one of the two rooms and I agree, and sometimes a lot of noises come from the wall where the door is in the dreams.

I’m also pretty sure that the area where the door is, is hollow because I knocked on the wall to test.

Anyway comment what you think this is please cause it’s really freaky."
t3_dvoeg0,all_ads,Sleeping/Dreaming,Thetruthishere,Isn't it crazy how you literally lay down and close your eyes and wait for your mind to slow down and your heart rate to slow down and to fall asleep and once your asleep you enter the dream world where literally anything can happen from you flying to you dying to you getting caught on fire and you feeling the sensation of your flesh burning but when you wake up you're totally fine? And then there's the people that can alter their dreams and lucid dream and that in itself is a can of worms. Its wild.
t3_dvv0pa,all_ads,Mirror Ghost?,Thetruthishere,"Hello Redditors. I believe this may be my 3rd post on this subreddit.

Not sure how to start this off and I’m not the best story writer; so no complaints please.

I have a bad habit of staying up all night, and sleeping all day. So when a man’s got to pee, I gotta go. Anyways, there’s a cabinet mirror attached to our bathroom wall right in front of the bathroom door basically. Our kitchen light is sometimes off, and sometimes on. So when I open the bathroom door, I open it up to look at the mirror since it’s basically the same height as me (5’10). What freaks me out is that I sometimes see… what I think as something behind me (in the kitchen) in the reflection of the mirror. But I’m not really sure if what I see in the reflection of the mirror is really there or not. So I brush this off as I reach to flick the bathroom light switch. Every-time I think about seeing something in that mirror as I am taking a wizz in the toilet, it’s almost like I feel an odd presence in the bathroom with me. So I rush to squeeze out what I can, flush the toilet, wash my hands, and walk as fast as I can to my room.

Not much to make of this story, but thought I’d share it here for the heck of it. It gives me the creeps, but idk what to think of it.

Edit: To clarify, I think I see things behind me in the kitchen through the reflection of our bathroom mirror. I can’t make out any faces or something like that. To be honest, I don’t know what I see. But it freaks me out. I’d say glimpses of a white shadow?"
t3_dvlyr8,all_ads,Do we all go hell?,Thetruthishere,Like has anyone had supernatural experinces that point that way?
t3_dvpu96,all_ads,The House in Sudan,Thetruthishere,
t3_dvibgc,all_ads,Snow Storm Encounter,Thetruthishere,"So this happened back in 2010, I was 10 at the time. So during this time it was a snow blizzard. It hit our city out of no where as our weather is known to be bi polar and have late winters. I lived with my cousins at the time.

This snow blizzard went on for a while, thick snow, freezing, this blizzard was so unexpected that no one was prepared for it. Powers were going out, people buying out the water supplies in stores, i remember seeing on the news people were using bbq grills inside homes for warmth. This mainly occurred in less fortunate areas, even though we lived in apartments we were fortunate enough to have our power on and other needed stuff. 

To some up how this blizzard was affecting us, it was cold to the point trees were falling. I lived on a giant pond, which where if you go on our balcony it would be water. Well that was frozen. So me being the 10 year old I am who doesn’t wanna play in the snow? So me and my cousin who was 18 at the time played out in the snow in the day time. We practically did that everyday whenever we got bored. But one day Him and I went outside in the parking lot outside my apartment, basically in front of my home. 

The only difference this time was we went to go play in the snow at 6pm and it had already been dark by this time because of daylight savings. We wait until it stops snowing til we go out. So we’re playing like normal, building snowman and walls anything normal you do in the snow right? Well we decided to attempt to make a snow wall so we needed lots of snow for that. Now it has been snowing heavy and where is the best spot to get a load of snow? Off of cars that haven’t moved of course!

We start building this wall and I’m taking snow off of trunks of cars, as theres thick layers its the easiest spot to obtain a chunk of snow. After a few back and forward of gettin snow off cars and bringing it to the wall we were building. I notice i haven’t touched my sister’s boyfriends car, wow thats a lot of snow they haven’t left in a few days! I tell my cousin lets go get that snow.

We are walking toward my sisters boyfriends car, we are now at it. We arrive at the trunk, and as soon as i grab a big two arm full of snow, a very loud *CLICK* is heard. In confusion i look around, and then look down and around The car, My Cousin, and I is a GREEN LIGHT in the shape of a circle around us. Now this is freaky enough in the moment, I decided to look up to see what the source of this light was. And what do you know? NOTHING WAS ABOVE US. So after noticing the light and nothing above us, i look at my cousin and start running home. 

I’m freaked out running looking around everywhere as i run home checking my surroundings, i see a Tree fall in the distance. Yeah it was cold like i mentioned earlier this was common during this little blizzard. But for this to happen at the moment of this weird phenomenon adds more chills to the story for me.

My cousin and I get inside and inside was my sister and his sister cooking. We rush in freaked out and they’re questioning whats wrong with us, we explain the chain of events that went down, and what do you know? Just like anyone who hears these type of stories, they said we were “stupid” “crazy” and we need to “stop playing”. Okay they don’t believe us, brush it off, who would expect anyone to? 

Now for the rest of that night my cousin and I just kept peeking out the window very often, our minds could not clear of that. We stayed up all night shook, kept peeking out the window. We played black ops all night til 7am, still peeking out the window every 5 minutes or so. This was not something we were just going to forget, let alone make this up.

To this day he still remembers this moment. A moment that should have been pure normal fun, into a creepy extra terrestrial sighting , which I believe. I am 18 now, but the details are still clear to this day as i have thought about it often ever since that moment. It is not something you forget. My cousin and I talk about this here and there when we see each other. But man oh man what a freaky incident.

I do not expect you to believe me, but i have had this on my mind for way too long, it is just something too unreal to keep to myself. I have come here to share my experience, i am looking for thoughts on this. What are your thoughts, what could it have been? Why did it target us? Why didn’t it do anything to us? To this day I have one too many unanswered questions, and they will never be answered and I’m just going to have to live with that. Thank you for reading"

t3_dv964s,all_ads,Static throughout my body,Thetruthishere,"Hello Redditors. This is my first post here. Just thought I’d share one of my weird and quite shocking and odd experience I had maybe a month ago.

Let’s get to it. So I’m 16 years old. One day, (not at night), I’m going to assume a month ago this was. Just playing Fortnite with some buddies in a Creative match. 1v1 back to back ya know? Anyways, there’s this television my brother picked up a few weeks ago from the side of the road in our neighborhood before this experience. It is mounted up on the wall in front of the monitor I was playing Fortnite on. We never use this T.V because the top 1/3rd of the screen is pretty messed up as if the T.V was punched by someone, but never got cracked. So here I am playing Fortnite, and the T.V turns on by itself. Keep in mind, we do not have a remote for this T.V, nor do we ever use it. It took me a few seconds to realize that the T.V had turned on, but I literally **FELT** throughout my entire body when this TV turned on. I looked up to the screen of it, and saw nothing but black and white static, along with a weak or no signal message on it. When the TV turned on, I heard the frequency of it, and **FELT** the static through my body when I looked at it. Believe me when I say this, I have NEVER felt anything like this before. It wasn’t a feeling of fear, but of STATIC. I sat there in the chair quite literally in a state of shock. I began to tell my friend over the microphone on game chat over Fortnite about what just happened. He told me to send a picture of the T.V on discord; in which I did. A few minutes after, my brother woke up from sleep (Insomnia. Day sleeper) and told me to turn the f**king T.V off. It’s like he knew it turned on too? So I told him what has just happened. I looked to the extension cord and unplugged that damn TV!

No remote. Cursed TV. End of discussion.

Edit: Also, I remember a tense feeling in my ears. My whole body, including my ears in particular, went very numb as the tv was on. And I’m getting chills just typing this. So no more edits."
t3_duzypn,all_ads,A story from r/Missing411 I believe you'll appreciate,Thetruthishere,
t3_duu703,all_ads,I keep having dreams about something and then it’ll happen a while after.,Thetruthishere,"Just want a little advice.

It started around a good 3-4 months ago.

I had a dream where I dreamt of walking through my local town with a group of people but couldn’t see their faces, it was just a blur but I could register the colours of their clothing vaguely. I woke up and thought nothing of it. I did not know who these people were in any way.

Then, a few weeks later I started this scheme in England called NCS (National Citizen Service) where you’re put with random people and you have to work together over the course of a few weeks and get a certificate at the end from the Prime Minister.

Anyway, a week into this, I went to my local town and I got a huge smack of Deja Vu and the people who I had recently become friends with who were strangers a few weeks ago were all lined up, in the exact same clothing, in the exact same positions, walking in the exact same ways and in the exact same town as what was in my dream.

Since then, I’ve had a few minor ones. I had one where I dreamt I was watching fireworks with my older brother, his girlfriend and stepson in a field I had never seen before. A week after I go to a fireworks display with them in the field from the dream with the same food stands, rides etc.

I don’t know what this is but if someone can offer me some advice that would be great.

I would love if I could see the lottery numbers in a dream but that doesn’t seem to be how it works lol. Seems more random.

Not sure if it’s something paranormal or literally just by chance. Maybe my brain is tricking me? Not sure."
t3_dv19l5,all_ads,"New House, Strange Things",Thetruthishere,"Hello,

New to Reddit. I decided to sign up to have someplace to post about this. If this isn't a good place for it, please let me know.

I've just recently moved into a new house. I wouldn't call it in ""in the middle of the woods"" but it's not far off. Aside from the house being a bit junky (housing market and all that) there didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until a few months of living here that I started noticing strange little things that I couldn't explain.

The first and most notable thing that happened is the strange disappearance of a rock. When I say ""rock"" I'm not talking about a driveway pebble. I'm talking about a fairly sizable rock that sat in my front yard that could have easily weighed a hundred pounds or more. I never really payed much attention to it's existence. Who would? It was just a random yard decoration likely placed there by the previous owners.

When I moved in one of the first things I noticed was the yard was absolutely covered in fuzzy little caterpillars called ""woolly bears"". I hate killing things, even bugs and I didn't want to accidentally step on any of these little guys so I took it upon myself to collect as many I could find and move them out of the way across the street where they could live their best buggy lives.

One day during my daily woolly bear collection I noticed about a dozen of them had collected around this rock in my front yard. I had never seen so many in one place. Usually they're scattered threw out the yard by themselves. I collected them all and moved on about my day and didn't really think anything else of it.

Later that same day I stepped outside to have a smoke. I usually sit on my front porch or wander around the front yard a bit while I puff on my cigarette. It didn't dawn on me at first but when I was almost done with my cigarette I slowly realized that the rock I had gathered the woolly bears off of that same day was gone. All that was left was a circular footprint where it had been.

This was certainly strange but nothing more than that. There was a bit of construction going on down the street and I figured maybe the construction crew had taken it for some reason. It still doesn't make a lot of sense. There are plenty of these rocks around. There's no reason to take one from someone's yard but perhaps they needed one to fill something in? I later learned they where putting in a driveway for the house down the street and I really don't see why they would need a rock for that.

I let it go and didn't pay much more attention to it until a few months later I realized that leaves weren't covering the spot where the rock had been. It's autumn and I'm surrounded by trees. leaves are covering the yard but not that one spot. I took some pictures. You can easily see where the rock had been. The spot is about 35 inches across, has dried out, dead grass and is surround by leaves.

At first I thought maybe an animal was using it as a bed. there are plenty of dear, bears, foxes, raccoons and coyotes around here but I've never seen an animal laying there. I stay up late and even at night I've never seen anything.

This spot is right next to my driveway where there's a motion sensing light that seemingly turns on at random when there's nothing and no one out there. I'm not sure if it's connected in any way or if it's just bad wiring.

More impotently, I wanted to find a picture of the rock that had been there to post in this thread. My first thought was google earth. Unfortunately, I'm pretty out of the way so there's no google street view here and the satellite view was no help either. You can barley see my house through the trees and what you can see is mostly covered by a shadow.

I did have an idea though. I went back to the real estate website I found the house on and brought up the pictures of it taken by the realtor but, unsettlingly, there's no rock in those pictures.

On the subject of the realtor, anyone who's ever bought a house has seen the lock boxes they put on the doors. it's a combination box that has the key to the house in it. Usually, after the house is sold, they swing by to pick up the lock box because no one wants that thing permanently attached to their door knob. Well, she never came back for it. I managed to get it off of the door and it's been sitting in my kitchen for months.

The second mysterious event was the stench. This only happened a few days ago as well. I was sitting down to eat a pizza I had just heated up. I popped in a movie and was settling in for the night. I started smelling this faint stench that I couldn't put my finger on. It wasn't very strong but was quite unpleasant. sometimes it seemed like it might be the pizza, sometimes it seemed like it might be my cloths and sometimes it seemed like it might be coming from under the couch. it was driving me crazy. I couldn't find where it was coming from and I couldn't pin down exactly what it smelled like. It smelled vaguely like sewage or poop but not exactly.

I spent over an hour hunting for it and couldn't find the source. Eventually I opened a few windows and sprayed the room with Lysol. That took care of it in that room but when I opened the door to my bedroom I was hit with a wave of the same smell but much more powerful. I looked under my bed, in my closet and anywhere else I could think but again, I couldn't find the source. I gave that room the same Lysol treatment and let it air out for about an hour. eventually it went away and I was able to go to bed. The stench hasn't come back and i still have no idea what it was. It was incredibly powerful in my bedroom and i've never smelled anything quite like it. Very strange.

The other small thing is the strange marks on the street in front of my house. I noticed these only a few days ago. They look like little scorch marks and they're only in front my house. None in front of the neighbors houses and none on the rest of the street. This might not be so mysterious. Maybe the previous owners liked to light off fire crackers or something but still strange that these are the only ones in the community and how dense they are in front of my place.

Before I bought it, the house had been on the market for over a year and the previous owners haven't been living here that entire time. seems strange to just move out without a buyer lined up. the last house I bought, the owners where living there until they sold it to me. It doesn't make any sense to move out and have to pay two mortgages and two sets of taxes and utilities for over a year unless you really don't want to be in that house for some reason. Then again, maybe they had to move for work or something. Who knows.

I really don't know what to make of this so I thought maybe someone here might have some insight. If anyone has any further questions, I'm happy to answer.

SMALL UPDATE:

I updated to include pictures above.

The next thing I wanted to see is if snow would collect on the spot the rock had been. I assumed I'd be waiting another month or so but conveniently it snowed last night. Not a lot but enough to see the results. Snow doesn't seem to like that spot either.

I wanted to make this update sooner but I've been a bit under the weather and just haven't felt up to it. But at this point I feel like I need to. A lot of weird stuff has been going on and I don't know what to make of any of it.

About a week ago I was cleaning my garage. I've been moved in for a while but never got around to setting up the garage. I got it mostly clean and the floor cleared. That's when I noticed there's a hallow spot under the floor. I noticed a huge difference between my footsteps from the center of the garage to the edge. If you jump in the middle you can feel the whole floor vibrate. As far as I know this house doesn't have a basement and there's certainly no entrance to one.

I might have passed it off as wonky foundation but there's this closet that always rubbed me the wrong way. it's just weird. it's under the staircase and is exactly the place stairs to a basement would be if there where any. It smelled like shit and had a bunch of old air freshener containers on the floor. The weirdest thing is the light. It has a wire connected to it but it doesn't go anywhere. it's just a dead wire that's been cut off and no switch anywhere. Not to mention the position of the light makes no sense. it's wedged in the back, about two feet off the floor. It's completely weird and non-nonsensical UNLESS you imagine it lighting basement stairs. Pictures below.

That being said, it's mostly just weird. What freaked me out was what happened a few days ago. I was sprawled out sick on the couch watching a movie when I heard my cat growling. I ignored it at first but she wouldn't stop so I rolled off the couch and went to see what her problem was. She was just staring at the door to the closet, looking scared and growling. I shooed her away and was too freaked out to open the door. Since then, I've woken up to the door being open on it's own three times now.

The stench has also been back. it hasn't been anywhere near as strong but it's been around and I still can't pinpoint it.

The spot where the rock was is still barren. no leaves, no snow, no nothing. just an empty patch of dirt.

The other weird thing was the massive ""chem trail"". I don't buy into the whole chem trail thing but this was odd. It was huge, right over my house and planes don't fly here. I've never seen or heard an airplane fly over this area and it was no different that day. I just went outside, looked up and saw this thing. It doesn't look like any natural cloud I've ever seen and like I said, I didn't hear or see anything that might have made it.

I live in an HOA but you would never know it. peoples yards and houses are a mess. The only reason I bring it up is because it has security and every night at about midnight or one for about a month now one of the security cars drives past my place and stops right across the street for a few minuets and then moves on.

There's a vacant house next door that's been on the market for longer than mine was. People keep showing up three or four cars at a time and it doesn't look like they're interested in the house. They drive up get out, ignore the house and stand in a circle and talk for about half an hour or so and then leave.

I don't know what to make of any of this stuff. I don't believe in the super natural or aliens or government conspiracies but there's just too much weird shit going on. Maybe the the cloud is nothing, maybe the closet is nothing, maybe the security car and groups of people next door are nothing, maybe all of it is nothing. All I know is I've never lived anywhere where so many questionable things happened on a constant basis and I feel very uncomfortable and on edge all the time.

There's even more I can get into. I still need to write about the fire pit but I'll save it for now. Does anyone have any thoughts here? This is getting beyond my capacity to rationalize."
t3_dv0y8w,all_ads,Something happened last spring and I can't find any answers.,Thetruthishere,"Let me start with this: I don't really believe in the paranormal, occult, or anything like that. However I do believe there is more out there that we just don't understand yet. With this in mind, if you have any possible explanation for what is below please share it.

I live in North Carolina but I spent my first year of college in Illinois. The first semester went well enough; mostly Bs and a bunch of new friends. But something happened after spring break. I remember wrighting a note to myself in physics that I was about to have a gap in my memory. I also talked about things like the end of the world, fundamental changes to reality taking place and other apocalyptic things. I also told myself that I needed to remember what happened and that I had to write down everything I could about this. I haven't a clue why I wrote any of this, but I do remember an intense feeling of anxiety and dread while I was writing it. 

The next thing I can remember is waking up about month (give or take a week) later in my dorm. I had shut out my friends, stopped going to classes or doing my work, and was risking failing out of college. 

That was over half a year ago by now but whatever that was has been bothering me ever since. I searched everywhere for an answer: from medical articles and more typical scientific sources to things like the occult, paranormal, dimension jumping and more. Nothing has explained what happened. The closest thing to an answer I got was anxiety induced amnesia. But if that is the case then anxiety from what?

There is some more details to this story but these are the main parts. This post is getting lengthy already and I don't what that to turn people away from reading. This is my last ditch effort at answering what the hell this is so if you have anything that could possibly explain what is happening then let me know. No answer is too strange for me at this point. Feel free to ask any questions you have about this."
t3_dul9ro,all_ads,I saw fairies when I was little!,Thetruthishere,"To paint this picture, I was born in 2002, and my entire childhood I was obsessed with fairies. At some point I began to get pieces of papers and write messages to fairies. I would tape them in various ""fairy"" places around my house- I had one above my bed, and the last one I put up before I saw the fairies was on a chair on my outside porch. I always wrote asking for them to visit me. I remember they finally came one night at 3:10 am.
I randomly woke up and saw tiny little balls of light around my piles of books I kept in bed (Until this event, I had always pictured fairies as looking like little people with wings). One of them, or a few of them (I don't remember) were singing something. I remember the lights were red, orange, and yellow. Unfortunately, although I had always wanted to meet them, after a few seconds I screamed and ran to my parents room and slept in their bed. The next day I drew pictures of the lights and showed it to my parents. I don't think I still have the picture but sometime soon I'm gonna look around for it. I regretted running away from them and once college apps are finished i'm going to spend the winter trying to figure out what happened and if I can contant the fairies again. 
All of the things I've read online about people meeting fairies describe them as people. Do you guys think the balls of light were something other than fairies? 
Additionally some people think that what happened was a dream since i was into fairies and it happened in the night, but y'all gotta trust me that it really was real."
t3_duhq1l,all_ads,Alien Visit?,Thetruthishere,"Ok soo I’m new to Reddit and I’m reading everything on here and I just HAVE to share my experience. 
Ok so in late 2016 and early 2017 I was pregnant with my second daughter. I remember one night I fell asleep in bed and I could sense something in the room with us. I KNOW it wasn’t sleep paralysis because I was able to move. I remember it was sort of an aura/ smoke sensation, if that makes any sense. And it seemed to be more than one, maybe three? And they spoke to me, I couldn’t really hear it but it’s as if I could hear it in my mind. I don’t know exactly WHAT happened but I remember feeling anxious and trying to wake my husband up but he was in really deep sleep. What I do remember is that they told me “We will be back to check on the fetus” and that was it. 
That was like 2 years ago and til this day, I still don’t know what that was!"
t3_dug71l,all_ads,Human body/human existence in general,Thetruthishere,"How in the world does the human body exist, like how does something get created perfectly and has all the perfect organs to function. Putting all religion and only facts and science behind it like my mind cant fathom around it. Not just humans but animals, ants, flies, even tapeworms.

t3_duna8s,all_ads,Random,Thetruthishere,Just had the most horrid dream. My dad was on a train (middle aged dad not old dad). Leaning out of window telling me to hurry up. I was trying but I could not reach the train then the door closed and the train left the station. He was waving from the window. Woke up and my pillow is soaked with tears. Still crying now. How bizarre! 🥺
t3_du8429,all_ads,Weird Vibe at Grand Canyon,Thetruthishere,"A few years ago my sister, her best friend, and I went on an extended weekend trip to the Grand Canyon.  None of us had ever been before so we spent the first day hiking trails and ended up at Yaki Point on the south rim to catch the sunset.  The mood was awe filled and hushed, but excited.  Of course we were going full tourist and snapping pics and selfies near the rim.  The sunset was glorious but as soon as the sun slipped under the horizon the mood shifted.  It immediately felt colder.  Gooseflesh rose on my arms and I had an overwhelming urge to get AWAY from the canyon edge.  Like far away.  My sister and her friend were seemingly unaffected, still snapping selfies as I started to get really anxious.  I figured I was being extra and kept my feelings to myself.  Until my sisters friend got frustrated after a series of selfie shots were ""ruined"" by blurs and dark patches.  She chalked it up to weird lighting, and passed the phone to me to take a few remaining shots.  As I looked at the screen to take the pics, I saw the blurs and shadows were not stationary.  Instead they moved around on the screen just beyond the canyon rim, then disappearing out of sight.  I couldn't see the movement (or any change at all) in real life and after a few seconds of watching my confused/mildly panicked face, my sister suggested we forget it and head out.  As we walked to the parking area she asked if I was ok, I told her what I had seen and she mentioned feeling weird at the canyon rim as well.  But she just ignored it.  I asked her friend if she had saved any of the weird pictures, but of course she hadn't.  I wish I had thought to switch her camera function to video so I could reexamine what I saw."
t3_duexx0,all_ads,Pennies From Somewhere,Thetruthishere,"When I was very young, maybe 8 or 10 years old, living in the city of Chicago, we had alleys behind our home, and one snow-covered but bright and sunny winter morning, taking my dog out on a leash to relieve himself, I remember seeing something glinting in the sunshine in the snow in the middle of the alley. I tied up my dog on the gate to our backyard, and went over to look closer. I saw three bright new pennies in the snow, and as I brushed the snow away, 4 or 5 more, then a few more. I ended up finding a good handful.

A couple days later, taking out the garbage, I looked over the gate leading to the alley and saw four pennies in the same area, again poking out of the snow. I knew I hadn't left any last time so these were newly placed. I ended up finding another almost handful in the snow. The next day after it snowed a bit more the night before, I went out into the alley and again, saw a couple shiny new pennies laying in the freshly fallen snow. Digging into the snow, I found a lot of pennies this time, almost more than I could fit in my two hands. I didn't tell anyone in my family about this, because I could barely believe it was happening myself, even as a little kid.

I looked again the next day, after getting home from school, and it had been a warmer day, and most of the snow had turned to dirty slush or melted completely. There was nothing there, not even one penny. I looked again for days after hoping to find another pile of cents, but even after another big snowstorm made drifts of snow cover the alley a couple weeks later, the pennies didn't show up again. Either someone was purposely putting the pennies there for someone to find, or dropped them by accident in the same place each time, which I doubt, or it could have been something else, which I can't explain, but it did bring some mysterious adventure to my life for a short time as a boy that I vividly still remember to this day."
t3_dup36s,all_ads,How do we talk,Thetruthishere,What human first thought of putting a sound together to get a word that could then be understood perfectly by someone else who can then respond with words that are defined by other words. And then their is other languages which are so much different but all have the same meanings which has to mean everything came from 1 language but nobody knows our first language?
t3_duldk5,all_ads,First Storytime,Thetruthishere,I was about 6 to 7 years old and I would go to my cousin house for a sleepover when all of a sudden my cousin start talking about a ghost and saying that it followred her ever were she goes so I get scared and later on we went downstairs to get something to eat and the ps4 which was in the living room was flickering and I just thought the ps4 was broken a 2 or 1 years later I go to another state ever summer to visit my family I was with my cousin again and everyone telling ghost story and then the same cousin who told me about this ghost talk about it with my other cousin and my other cousin which I'll call her liza didn't believe her but we were all dumb enough to go in the closet to tested it out which was a bad idea and I didn't want to go in the closet then 10 minutes went by and ran out the closet saying they say her and when ever they ask her a question she would answer and I get scared and could not sleep at night and now everytime i see my closet door is open I always close it.
t3_du33aj,all_ads,Stolen Identity...Card,Thetruthishere,"My first semester at college, I lost my school ID about 3 weeks in.  Replacements were $25 and I was on scholarship, so I wasn’t keen on replacing it.  But you needed it for everything – building entry, food, the gym – everything.  I turned my classrooms, the lunchroom, lost and found, my dorm and my specific room UPSIDE DOWN looking for this thing for a week before I gave up.  Paid my money, got a new badge, and then when I went back to my dorm room and dumped out my bag… out came the old ID (different picture).  Swore up a blue streak because I’d checked the bag about 900 times, every pocket, nook, and cranny.  No holes or anything weird and used the bag for like 10 years without it eating anything else so my only explanation is… gremlins."
t3_du3e89,all_ads,A portal in the wall,Thetruthishere,"I'm not sure what flair to use for this post, Unidentified makes the most sense.

When I was about 9 years old &amp; going to school at a private Christian school.
It was early spring and I had just came in from playing on the playground and I saw a girl around my age standing by the wall except she wasn't standing there, It looked like a sort of hologram but we talked  to each other and she told me that her name was Chelsea and we didn't talk much just a quick hello and name exchanging.
I told he I had to go, and then I went into there classroom... I never thought anything of it until we moved about 2 years later.
Now here's where it gets interesting.. I met her in person, I had asked if her name was Chelsea and she said yes, she said she saw me and showed me the area of the school where she said I was standing.
Now that was it, we never ended up being close friends or even dating.. So my question is.. What was it? And how did we both see the same exact thing?"
t3_dtqnyj,all_ads,The funeral crasher,Thetruthishere,"My son died young. Neither I nor my ex husband had much in the way of friends and family so there were maybe 10 people at our sons funeral, held at my ex mil house as he was cremated, all related/ known for years. About a week later numerous people asked me who the strange lady I invited was. They said she was weirdly tall, never introduced herself by name, spoke briefly to a couple of people and even swear to me I talked to her and never said goodbye, just was gone. I though it was my adoptive mother but when I showed them her picture it wasnt her and obviously she said it wasnt her based on the people she talked to. I stayed in the kitchen almost the whole time except for the actual 5 minute outside event and never really talked to anyone for obvious reasons. Even then it was barely answering questions about the food or the service timing. Still have no clue who showed up or why and still have no clue what this conversation was I had."
t3_dttui5,all_ads,Strange beam in the sky!,Thetruthishere,"A number of years ago I went to pick my sister up from a panto rehearsal with my mum. She was rehearsing in little village hall down a load of winding roads with no street lights. On our way my mum and I both saw bright white light in the sky with a huge beam coming from it that lit the sky completely. We pulled over the car and got out to have a better look. The light was way too high to be a plane and was completely still. We stood watching it for a few mins and then it suddenly disappeared. It didn't fly off, it was just like a light a bulb going off. 

So we got back in the car and drove to the hall where we told a few of the parents what we'd seen. One man told us to read the local papers, apparently lots of people had been sighting unusual things in the area.

Haven't seen anything like it since. But I often think about it and wonder what it was we saw that night!"
t3_dtjcyw,all_ads,"Yellow ""glowstick"" figure?",Thetruthishere,"This happened to me a few years back in 2017, and I was curious to see if anyone had experienced something similar. 

I was laying in my bed at about 11pm, and I was about to fall asleep. I had music playing from a small bluetooth speaker across the room on my dresser. As I laid there with my eyes closed, I kept imagining that I was laying on my friends' couch, looking into her hallway. This wasn't really a dream, as I was still conscious, but it felt like I wasn't fully coming up with this thought of my own free will--it felt more like an intrusive thought coming from my subconscious. In her hallway, a figure appeared. It was in the shape of a person, with no clothes or features. It was also glowing yellow. The best way I can describe it is like a glowstick, where the light wasn't really illuminating it's surroundings and staying mostly self-contained. The figure wasn't moving, just standing in the hall and looking at me.

I opened my eyes and looked across the room. Right next to my bluetooth speaker I could see a glowing ball of blue light. I thought it was the LED on the front of the speaker, but I was confused by how big it looked. Suddenly, the light shot off into the corner of my room, and sent my speaker flying about three feet away, where it landed on the ground.

I started to freak the fuck out. I pulled my blankets over my head and tried to figure out what had just happened. I decided to look out and see if the ball of light was still there. When I peaked out, I saw the figure that I had imagined a few minutes prior floating maybe a foot above my bed, parallel to me. I pulled the sheets back over my head and just laid there in fear. After a few minutes, I reached out and pulled the cord to my ceiling light. When I looked out, the figure was gone. I picked up my speaker, and nothing else happened that night.

A few months later, I was talking to my friend who's house I was in when I first imagined the figure. I was telling her about what had happened, when she said that her sister had seen the same figure in that hallway in real life on multiple occasions. (To be fair, this could have totally been her fucking with me.)

Other weird things also happened in that room. One time after this incident, I was laying in bed when it began to shake. I also heard tapping on my window and knocks on the wall coming from outside my room every night at 12:13am (cliché, I know) that would stop when I went to investigate.

I don't really know what to make of what happened to me. I've never really experienced anything else paranormal in my life--besides a UFO encounter when I was little and the other weird things that happened in that room--but I would describe myself as at least somewhat of a believer in the supernatural. The fact that I imagined the figure before actually seeing it suggests to me that it might have been some form of sleep paralysis, but I've never had sleep paralysis before or since, and I can't explain the speaker flying off my shelf. I looked up similar occurrences and didn't really find anything that was super similar to what I had experienced."
t3_dtsh0v,all_ads,Help me please,Thetruthishere,"I saw a dream today of a statue figure with angel wings and its whole outline was shiny gold I was truly amazed by its beauty,it was also surrounded by small black figures with bat like wings i guess they were demons and it handed me a gold coin. Can anybody tell me if the dream ment something. Before I forget at that night hours before i went to sleep I looked at the moon and asked for a sign if there is a higher power out there and if they can hear me could the dream be the sign I asked and what does that coin mean."
t3_dtmkol,all_ads,Text message from the other side,Thetruthishere,"Okay so I have not heard this happen to anyone, and I cannot explain it, nor can any of my internet research so far. 

My Mom passed away September 6, 2019. She always said when she passed away that given the chance she would definitely haunt people or let her loved ones know she was there or okay. My neighbor at the apartments, Jess, we lived at considers herself Wiccan and open to the spirit world. My mom was also very into that stuff etc....

Well yesterday, November 7th, I text Jess in the morning because my cat had been having seizures all night and I knew it was his time. RIP, he was 17. She is also an avid animal lover, the one who found my mom after she had a stroke, and in general very close to my mom. So I knew she would go to the vet with me and be there as a supportive friend.

As I got ready, she said ""Hey I have a question and I didn't know how to bring it up.""

So to sum this up, that morning at 5:01 am a text came through from my mom's phone that said: Cleaning house and got a pedicure so all is well with my world 

So I got my mom's phone, which has been dead, and in only my possession, with a pass code and still has the same number with service. There were no drafts, the text is not on her phone, and there no explanation.

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there any reasoning? I live close to Cassadega, Florida and I think I may go see a medium soon, but figured Reddit was the next best place to find some answers or people with the same occurrence. 

I have screenshots of all of this."
t3_dtlqfe,all_ads,What did I see on Snapchat?,Thetruthishere,"I’d say as far back as 2012 I was a kid on Snapchat in the earliest stages of the app.  When it came out, my older sister who lived across the country introduced it to me, saying we could send pictures and videos to each other before she came to visit next, which was a long time away. So I used the app everyday, taking videos of myself making funny faces and sending them to her as frequently as I could. Let’s talk about why I’m here though. I was sitting in my bed facing the wall with the front facing camera of my iPhone 4s taking videos of myself sticking my tongue out at my sister. After, I’d review the footage proudly and then hit send to my one and only contact. This time, I noticed something that was very different in the background. Midway through, I noticed a face, bright and shapeless, peeking from the closet door to the right of me. It stares for a minute very impishly before darting out, speed of lightening past me before disappearing down the stairs that led up to my third story bedroom.  I was terrified. I feared that demons were after me or something because (and here’s where you scream at me) I deleted the video after watching it again to make sure it wasn’t a trick of the lights or eyes playing tricks kind of scenario. Nope. Demon. I deleted. In tears, I rushed downstairs to where my little brother (probably 6) was asleep. I woke him and asked him between sobs if he had been in my room which he denied, confused and very obviously asleep (he’s the deepest sleeper I know). I knew all along it couldn’t have been him and I still know. I just wonder what it could have been."
t3_dtkm62,all_ads,Aliens &amp; Dancing Elfs...sleep paralysis? [ME] and [FAM],Thetruthishere,"I've had vaguely dreamlike alien encounters since I was 7 years old. I remember a ""dream"" where I walked out to my deck and saw a classic saucer shaped UFO hovering between our house and the neighbor's. This was then followed up with the experience of seeing a oval ""gray"" alien type head looking into my window at night. I freaked out and nightly ran to my parents room when it happened, it went on for a couple months before ultimately stopping. No memories of abduction or anything like that. I've always had a fear of sleeping alone, even into adulthood - typically sleeping with the covers over my head, but no personal encounters until recently again.

First, I've been traveling a lot for work as of late. I've noticed that either before I leave or immediately before I get back, I'll get a sore pimple like bump behind my ear. I'm in my late 30's, so acne isn't really an issue...it's been annoying but nothing too weird. It didn't really strike me until my wife told me about a recent set of experiences she's had. She woke up one night to see 3 smaller gray aliens on my side of the bed - she closed her eyes on purpose and looked again and they were gone. She didn't feel fearful, almost like they were watching over me.

Recently, she also had a small dancing creature experience as well - she woke up and something that resembled an elf was looking at itself dancing in one of the wall mirrors we have. It didn't notice her, she closed her eyes and reopened and it was gone. I can easily dismiss the alien and dancing elf as sleep paralysis type experiences - but the timing of the aliens to reemerge alongside the behind ear bumps causes some correlation in my mind that I wanted to share and see if anyone has experienced something similar? The dancing elf thing is the weirdest part to me in all of this though...but all experiences have never felt menacing to my wife which so far is great.  Any experiences of elfs + aliens?  Or is this likely just dreams creeping through via sleep paralysis?

Only weird thing I've captured on an outdoor camera is a strange beam of light.  Only captured it once, it was the only ""motion"" to be seen in the clip as well.  Check it out here (beam is in the bottom right corner) : https://ring.com/share/6750908537368650144"
t3_dtl2pf,all_ads,Floating Cat Eyes,Thetruthishere,"This time of the year always reminds me of this very peculiar thing I witnessed as a child around the holidays. I haven't really spoken of it much, but after joining reddit... maybe some of you have had this experience as well or could at least theorize to the possibility of what it was.

Anyways, sometime around daylight savings when I was very young I was sitting in our dining room waiting for dinner. Our table was right next to these sliding doors that led to the patio, that then led to our very open yard (not many trees or decorations, just a lot of yard). I glanced outside and it was already super dark &amp; I saw what looked like cat eyes float across the yard near the patio. I say cat eyes because they had the slit-like pupils. 

It was a peculiar sight because the eyes stayed locked onto my house even as they floated across my yard - and I couldn't see any outline indicating it was in fact a cat or animal out there. Plus our motion lights didn't go off.

Now yes this definitely could have actually have been a cat, but the things I experienced after were much more difficult to write off. 

My mom, sister, and I sat around our table laughing and eating when the motion lights went off, revealing a very empty and still patio / yard. Usually the lights went out after a handful of minutes automatically, but they stayed on for a good portion of our meal. I remember even my mom noting ""maybe there's a bug flying around the light keeping it on"".  and yes... maybe. But it creeped me out!! I couldn't help but imagine some figure just slowly swaying on our patio staring at us eating our meal.

Finally, the lights turned off and we started cleaning up. After a few rounds of bringing the dishes to the sink I was tasked with wiping down the table. I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched and fighting my intuition to hide, I looked outside. 

Standing - or rather, floating - by the sliding door were these GIANT cat eyes. They occupied at least 2/3rds of the door height. They were this really sickly yellow-green color with the pupils slowly widening. I froze and my voice felt like it was caught in my throat. I felt overwhelmed by fear staring at this thing. I finally gained some sense of ground and yelled for my mom. She came rushing over and all I told her was that ""there was a giant cat"". She told me it was okay and that I probably saw a coyote. But I couldn't articulate the sheer size of it to her no the dread I felt as it watched me. 

This was the only encounter I had actually seeing this thing. But so much dark energy surrounded the house after that night. My parents got divorced, my mom ended up dating a shitty guy who just fed the negative energy. I always felt I was being watched in that home.... I don't know what I saw or experienced, but I won't ever forget how god awful that thing made me feel."
t3_dtnsrb,all_ads,Ring doorbell cam captured this...,Thetruthishere,"... not sure what to make of it. A part of me wants to shrug it off and say it must have been a drop of rain or dust (?) but it looks very odd. 

It appeared as I got home, stayed for a bit, moved around and then disappeared. Neither I nor my neighbors could see it with our bare eyes. 

What do you think it is?

t3_dt2l95,all_ads,My mother just told me about an experience I had as a child.,Thetruthishere,"I didn't really believe in ghosts and spirits before this, but she made me reconsider it.

She told me about an encounter with spirits/ghosts I had as a child. Approximately 3-4 years old.

At the time, I had my own room. My bed was in the corner of the room.

A lot of nights, I'd find myself horrified, by some kind of children in the corner of the room.

They were standing in a triangular formation, with the front person facing me. They all were looking at me like this (http://imgur.com/a/0d3at7v)

My mother contacted someone, the woman she contacted told her that these spirits, they were from ancient time. She had never seen my room, nor spoken about it, yet she was able to recreate the room and the problem I was having.

She told my mother that she was gonna tell the spirits that I couldn't tell what they wanted, so they should go away. I never had a problem again.

She also said to my mother that she had to deliver a message from someone. ""Linde will be okay"". Linde was at this time my step sister, and she was going through a hard time with diseases. Everyone thought she was going to die.

My mother had never even mentioned she had a step daughter."
t3_dt8l1z,all_ads,My old phone number called,Thetruthishere,"So early this morning at 2:30am, my mom received the following text message- ""😂 love you mom"" 
Weird part is, it's from my old phone # that I stopped using in August. 

The phone associated with that # hasn't been turned on for weeks!

This morning at 7:30am, my mom texted me asking if it was from me.

I turned the old phone on, and there's no outgoing message like that.

This evening I arrived at her house and saw her phone. I expected it to be similar to my old number, but guys. It WAS my old #. 

Even if my old # has been re-issued, how would that person have my contacts?! 

I still have the old phone, and the text from my old # said ""I love you mom"" in a text to MY mother.
Just... Please can someone explain how this is possible?

EDIT: wording"
t3_dt6xgl,all_ads,Maybe I was just really hungry,Thetruthishere,"Around 12 years ago when I was 8 years old, my family and I were driving through Mayo in Ireland on our way home from the airport. It was pretty late, around 9 or 10 pm and we were driving in the middle of nowhere. It was a very rural part, surrounded by multiple fields. There was a single car ahead of us but nothing else for miles.

I don’t know how or when we decided to stop the car to get out and look, but we had. We pulled up on the side of the road, as did the car in front of us to gaze at the weird thing in the sky.

This is going to sound ridiculous, but I looked like a giant orange triangle, like a chilli heatwave Dorito. It was pretty big and hung in the sky above the tree line, it was perfectly still and for ages we just stared trying to figure out what it was. 

After about 5-10 minutes, the triangle turned black and had tiny white dots across it, as if it was trying to blend itself into the night sky, knowing we could see it. We could still see the outline however as it appeared like there was a light coming from the back of it, illuminating the sides. 

Like if you were to shine a flashlight behind an object, making the sides stand out. 

The triangle then began to tumble as if it were rolling down a stairs and eventually fell beyond the horizon and out of sight. 

My entire family to this day can testify to the details of this event, we never spoke to people in the car in front, but I’d say it would make for an interesting conversation."
t3_dtens4,all_ads,I can see the shadow people now?,Thetruthishere,"A few days ago, I found this subreddit, and Im in love with it. All the stories were amazing, but the stories i loved the most were the ones about the shadow people.

Honestly, my life is boring. Too normal for me. So, being the dummy i am, i kinda... wished to see the shadow people? 

I’m a normal, healthy teenager. There are no reasons for me to see Them. But just a few moments ago, while walking to my bus stop, i could see them. They were everywhere. But when i looked at them directly, they disappeared. I also heard multiple strange noises, like blunt objects falling on the floor.

Please tell me if you have seen something similar.

Edit: omfg i just saw one its on the bus"
t3_dt5ri2,all_ads,[FAM] My late brother watches over my mother,Thetruthishere,"Note before starting: I wrote this post because this post (link: r/Thetruthishere/comments/c4bh4m/coworker_opened_the_door_what_was_behind_it_will) is quite similar to my mothers experience. Also, buckle up as this is quite long because its 2 stories in one post.

Slight background of my late brother. Physically, he was tall, thin, had a high bridged nose and a well-defined jawline (Basically Steve Aoki with shorter hair and no beard). He was friendly and good-natured but, my father wasn't fond of him. My father would occasionally hit him as he was quite a troublemaker (peer pressure)and didn't perform well academically.

He became quite fond of my mother who understood his side and gave him the time of day. He would talk about his problems with my mom and would find comfort when shes around. In general, he loved my mom very much.

My brother passed away in 2015 due to a sports accident. My mom hasn't even got over it to this day (same as me).

Now to the paranormal parts, which happened on two separate occasions:

#####1st occasion:
My mother was having a big fight with her co-workers due to their incompetence and dishonesty. Now, a small backstory about my mom, she is the most mild-mannered and gentle person I know. She's kind, easy to get along and, when something really bad happens in general, stays calm and rationally thinks about the problem. If she reaches her boiling point and starts getting irritated, you know something extremely bad has or had happened.

After the verbal fight, She went to the office kitchen to relax. In the kitchen were two of her friends and, as she entered the room, noticed one of her friends frozen and pale white. She asked her what's wrong and she said:

- friend1: "" *mom*, did you pass a guy on the hallway before you entered here?""
Note: *mom* = my mothers name.
- Mom: ""No, why? Is there someone trespassing here in our office?""
- friend1: ""I don't know, I was getting coffee and when I turned around, I saw a pale guy walking and going out of the door. Did you see him friend2?""
- friend2: ""Nope, I had my back turned so I didn't see anything.""
- Mom: ""Did you get a glimpse of what he looked like? I might need to report this to security.""
- friend1: ""Yeah kinda, he was pretty tall and was quite lanky in stature, he looked like he was in a hurry.""

They all stood in the room in silence for a while and as a passing comment, friend2 said: ""looks like your son is watching over you, *mom*"".

#####2nd occasion (This happened today):
My mother was having a huge disagreement with one of the nurses on the phone and, yet again, finds herself getting stressed and raising her voice. Another coworker inside her office was sitting on an office chair, swaying back and forth. He swayed too hard and faced my mom and at that moment, he froze, quickly looked down and quietly said: ""*Mom*, you should relax and settle down, please"".  Oblivious, my mom continued yelling at the phone. A few minutes after she calmed down, she saw her co-worker looking down and asked what's wrong. He reluctantly looked up and deeply exhaled.

- Co-worker: ""*mom*, I think I saw your son behind you.""
Note:(Co-worker knew bout my late brother as my mother talked to him about it before)
- Mom: ""What? What are you talking about..."" *silence*
- Co-worker: ""It's true! I don't lie about these things *mom*, didn't you notice I was slightly shaking when I was looking at you?""
- Mom: ""I thought you were just startled by my voice?...""
- Co-worker: ""I'm used to loud voices and screaming, my family was like that, it was the person standing behind you that startled me...""
- Mom: ""Behind me? What did he look like?""
- Co-worker: ""He was pretty slim and was taller than you. He also had a nicely bridged nose. He looked like he was worried.""

The Co-worker explained that he can ""see"" ghosts or apparitions and learned it from his sister when he was little. He also told my mom of other ghosts that he ""sees"" around and outside his apartment complex.

- Co-worker: ""He looked concerned while looking at you *mom*, you should take it easy for now.""

#####How this relates to the other post:
It seems like something paranormal happens (an apparition or ghost in this post and the coworker post) when a highly unlikely negative event had, have, or will happen.
Ex:

- Co-worker post: Something bad happens to Dave and his family =&gt; deceased friend shows up.
- My post: When my mother is highly stressed and angry =&gt; my late brother shows up.

This might just be some coincidence and all of this is just speculation. Still, if you know any stories or occurrences like this, feel free to post below. In the unlikely event that my dead brother could read this, I just want to say I miss you and thank you for watching over mom in her times of need."
t3_dssqhy,all_ads,A Reddit comment that stuck with me.,Thetruthishere,"I don’t know what it is about this comment, but it gives me the chills every time I read it. It’s up to you to decide whether or not it’s real, but either way, it’s scary as hell. Thoughts?
